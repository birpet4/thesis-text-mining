In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.",p,p
"An “ownership interest” is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.",p,p
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions.

"The Issuer may be deemed to be a “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. “banking entities” and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.",p,p
"The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. The holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,p
"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Refinancing Notes. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Refinancing Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally.",p,p

RISK FACTORS,h2,title
"An investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Refinancing Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Refinancing Notes and the related arrangements.

1.1 General,p,title
"The Issuer has invested, and will continue to invest, in loans, bonds and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Refinancing Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Refinancing Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Refinancing Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Refinancing Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Refinancing Notes in the Priority of Payments. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular, payments in respect of the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes. None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or the Collateral Administrator undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Refinancing Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.",p,p
"In preparing and furnishing the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (who will rely, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager and third parties) and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.",p,p
"In addition, the information contained in the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports is dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator. The accuracy of the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports, and the information included therein, is therefore subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator.",p,p
"While the latest Payment Date Report and the latest Monthly Report (as defined herein) with respect to the underlying assets are included as Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto respectively, and are expressly incorporated into this Offering Circular, such information has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by any accounting firm, independent accountants or any other third party, either in connection with the offering of the Refinancing Notes or otherwise.

1.2 Prior Activities of the Issuer,p,uncertain
"The Issuer was incorporated on 10 June 2016. On 15 December 2016, the Issuer issued the Original Notes secured by various assets owned by the Issuer.",p,p
"The only operations that an issuer of structured rated notes similar to the Refinancing Notes is ordinarily permitted to perform prior to the issue date thereof is the entry into the warehouse arrangements in respect of the acquisition of certain assets on which such notes are to be secured on or prior to such issue date. This is to mitigate the risk that creditors of the issuer may exist as a result of the activities of such issuer who may be able to take action against the issuer should it not perform its obligations to the extent that such creditors have not entered into limited recourse and non-petition provisions similar to those to which the Secured Parties are subject pursuant to the Trust Deed. This risk is potentially increased in the case of the Issuer, as a result of it having issued the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"In order to mitigate this increased risk, all Classes of the Notes will, on the Issue Date, be subject to the same Conditions and Transaction Documents and the secured parties under the Original Notes will be party to such Transaction Documents.",p,uncertain
1.3 Suitability,p,title
"Prospective purchasers of the Refinancing Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Refinancing Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Refinancing Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Refinancing Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,p
1.4 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,p,uncertain
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.",p,p
1.5 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,p,uncertain
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Refinancing Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and",p,p
"the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,p
1.6 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,p,uncertain
"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.",p,p
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.,p,p
"As discussed further in “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,p
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of adverse economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Refinancing Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Refinancing Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors.",p,p
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,p
"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Refinancing Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
"Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirements for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial distress of another financial institution may result in the",p,p
"disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Refinancing Notes.",p,uncertain
"The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Refinancing Notes as well as the Collateral.",p,p
"While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.",p,p
"1.7 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders",p,uncertain
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Refinancing Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Refinancing Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,p
1.8 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,p,uncertain
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,p
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,p
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,p
"Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer, and the Refinancing Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. It is difficult to predict the final outcome of the Euro zone crisis. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
Referendum on the UK’s EU Membership,p,title
,p,p
"On 23 June 2016, the UK held an advisory referendum with respect to its continued membership of the EU (the “Referendum”). The result of the Referendum was a vote in favour of leaving the EU. Whilst the result of the Referendum itself is clear, the next steps of the UK executive and UK Parliament and the reaction of the other Member States to these steps is not. In particular, the format of the negotiations, the negotiation positions of the participants and timeframe are uncertain, with any limited public statements subject to change.",p,uncertain
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Article 50”) provides that a Member State which decides to withdraw from the EU is required to notify the European Council of its intention to do so.,p,p
"The UK government gave formal notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 on 29 March 2017, which triggered the commencement of a negotiation process between the UK and the EU in respect of the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Article 50 provides for a two year period for such negotiations to take place (unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK unanimously decides to extend this period, in respect of which see below) (the “Article 50 Period”).",p,p
"It is possible that the UK will leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement in place, which could result in political and economic uncertainty. Investors should be aware that the Issuer's risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.",p,p
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,title
,p,p
"It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established, or at what date (whether by the time when, or after, the UK ceases to be a member of the EU), or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.",p,p
"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future EU-UK relationship, EU laws (other than those EU laws transposed into English law (see below)) will cease to apply within the UK pursuant to the terms and timing of a future withdrawal agreement. This would be achieved by the UK ceasing to be party to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by the parallel repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. The UK will cease to be a member of the EU from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, if a withdrawal agreement has not been concluded, two years after the notification under Article 50 was served, unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period (in respect of which see below).",p,p
"On 25 November 2018, a negotiated withdrawal agreement was endorsed by leaders at a special meeting of the European Council. The negotiated withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period, which would start on the date of entry into force of the agreement, which it stated to be 30 March 2019, and to end on 31 December 2020, unless extended by a single decision for up to one or two years. The negotiated",p,p
"withdrawal agreement stated that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law would be applicable to and in the UK during the transition period.",p,uncertain
"However, the UK government needs the approval of the UK Parliament in order to ratify the negotiated withdrawal agreement, which has not yet been forthcoming.",p,p
"In response to a second UK request to extend the Article 50 Period, on 11 April 2019 the European Council adopted its decision to extend the Article 50 Period until 31 October 2019.",p,p
"On 9 September 2019, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 received Royal Assent and passed into law. This legislation provided that if by 19 October 2019, either a deal had not been ratified by the UK Parliament or “no deal” had not been approved by the UK Parliament, the UK Government would be required to request from the EU an extension to the UK’s departure date to 31 January 2020 (or another date if the UK Parliament approved a date suggested by the EU). Although the UK Government and the EU reached an agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement on 17 October 2019, this revised deal had not been approved by the UK Parliament by 19 October 2019. On that day, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, the UK Government sent a request for a further extension to the Article 50 Period to the President of the EU Council. This request was accompanied, however, by a further communication indicating that the UK Government did not wish the EU to grant such an extension.",p,p
"At this time it is not possible to state with certainty if and when any withdrawal agreement will be entered into, what might be the final terms and effective date of such a withdrawal agreement or the date on which any transition period will end if such an agreement is entered into.",p,p
"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,p

"If the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK, or a Dutch exemption, is not in place, then (a) a UK manager such as the Collateral Manager may be unable to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer in reliance upon the passporting of relevant regulated services within the EU on a cross-border basis provided for under MiFID II and (b) the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder to the extent it was holding the retention solely as “sponsor” in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (even if the Collateral Manager were to remain subject to UK financial services regulation).

1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,p,uncertain
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred",p,p

2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES,p,title
2.1 Regulatory Initiatives,p,title
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be, increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,p
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Trustee nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Refinancing Notes for legal, investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Refinancing Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All investors whose investment activities are subject to: investment laws, rules and regulations (including risk retention laws, rules and regulations that apply currently to the investor, or which may do so in the future); regulatory capital requirements; or to review by regulatory authorities, should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes are subject to any such investment or other restrictions and to unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Agents, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Refinancing Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor's investment in the Refinancing Notes).",p,p

2.2 Basel III and Basel IV,p,uncertain
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities",p,p
"(for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the framework of Directive 2009/138/EC in the European Union.",p,uncertain
"In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks' RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework's standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,p
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Refinancing Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Refinancing Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.",p,p
2.3 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements,p,uncertain
Securitisation Regulation,p,title
,p,p
Background,p,title
,p,p
"A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the CRR (as defined in the Conditions) (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).",p,p
"There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below. Most of the relevant technical standards have not yet been adopted.",p,p
"Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Refinancing Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Refinancing Notes and the transactions described herein are",p,uncertain

No such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.",p,p
Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors,p,uncertain
,p,p
"The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the CRR, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).",p,p
"These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified (among other things) that: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investor; (ii) the originator, sponsor or securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which see “Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation; and (iv) where the originator or original lender is established in a non-EU country, credit granting criteria apply that are substantially similar to those in (iii).",p,p
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.,p,uncertain
"Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those Institutional Investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge in respect of the Refinancing Notes acquired by the relevant investor.",p,p
Risk Retention Obligation,p,title
,p,p
"The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or of up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover (the “Pecuniary Sanctions”).",p,p
Any such Pecuniary Sanction levied on the Retention Holder may materially adversely affect the ability of the Retention Holder to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.,p,p
"With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below.",p,p
"In particular, investors should note that the Retention Holder initially intends to retain such material economic interest as “sponsor” pursuant to the EU Retention Requirements. However, if the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of MiFID II and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK is not in place, then, unless the Collateral Manager elects to take any Retention Cure Action in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents, it may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder. As detailed in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – The Retention” below, the Collateral Manager may in its sole discretion having determined that a Retention",p,p

"(ii) receipt of legal advice from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, DLA Piper UK LLP or other reputable legal counsel as selected in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion that such Retention Cure Action is consistent with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).",p,p
Transparency Requirements,p,title
,p,p
"The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e. the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting requirements in Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) (the “Transparency Requirements”). The reporting entity must make certain prescribed information available to holders of a securitisation position, to the relevant competent authorities (“Competent Authorities”) and, upon request, to potential investors.",p,p
"Under Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing. It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form (which may be subject to change following pricing) by way of a website (see http://sf.citidirect.com). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date.",p,p
"Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) (“Inside Information”); and, where applicable, information on “significant events” (“Significant Events”). Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and, to the extent applicable, Significant Events are required to be made available “without delay”.",p,p
"The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not more than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.",p,p
"On 22 August 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) published its final report on the technical standards under the Transparency Requirements containing detailed draft disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports, Investor Reports and, in relation to public transactions only, Inside Information and Significant Events (the “Transparency RTS”). The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Transparency RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted revised Transparency RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019. The Commission adopted these revised Transparency RTS on 16 October 2019. The European Parliament and the Council have a prescribed period following the Commission’s adoption in which they may object to the Transparency RTS. The application date of the technical standards has not yet been specified. There remains significant uncertainty as to the scope and the application date of the reporting requirements contained in the Transparency RTS.",p,p
"The transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the Transparency Requirements provide that until the application of the Transparency RTS, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the “CRA3 RTS”). Currently, there is no",p,p
"dedicated CRA3 RTS template for CLO transactions (other than with respect to content of Investor Reports set out in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS), nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS.",p,p
"On 30 November 2018, the European Banking Authority (the “EBA”), ESMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (the “European Supervisory Authorities” or “ESAs”) published a joint statement (the “Joint Statement”) regarding the reporting templates to be used for the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports (the “Article 7 Quarterly Reporting Requirements”) in the period until the Transparency RTS apply.",p,p
"The ESAs stated that they expect Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.",p,p
"In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) and make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports (see “Description of the Reports”).",p,p
Transparency Requirements – Collateral Manager and Issuer arrangements,p,uncertain
,p,p
In relation to the Transparency Requirements: (a) the Issuer will be designated as the reporting entity;,p,uncertain
"(b) the Collateral Manager will undertake in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the Transparency Requirements; and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available (or procure that such information is made available) via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager and as further notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies (substantially in the form set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator from time to time) (which certificate may be given electronically and upon which certificate the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is a competent authority, a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes (and in such other manner as required by any competent authority (as instructed to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator)). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
"Once the Transparency RTS apply, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Transparency RTS. Prior to the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, the Issuer intends to fulfil the requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and",p,p
"(e) of Article 7(l) through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”). The Joint Statement is not a legally binding document and there is currently uncertainty in relation to the legal position as regards the form of quarterly reporting until the date of application of the Transparency RTS. Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies the Transparency Requirements and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager as the originator, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy the Transparency Requirements.",p,p
Whether the Collateral Manager will be able to obtain and provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the Transparency Requirements is unclear.,p,p
"Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the sponsor as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer (to the extent the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer)), or by Collateral Manager, to fulfil the Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
The Collateral Manager is required to indemnify the Issuer for Collateral Manager Breaches in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Collateral Manager may be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager (See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” below).,p,p
"If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Refinancing Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Refinancing Notes; and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Refinancing Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.",p,p
U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,title
,p,p
"On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset- backed securities.",p,p
"On February 9, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) ruled in favour of the LSTA in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As a result, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that no party expects to be required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and none of the Collateral Manager or its affiliates will have any obligation to hold any Notes for any period of time, on the basis that it intends to qualify as an “open market CLO”. It should be noted that the LSTA decision (the “LSTA Decision”) did not specifically address all of the features of the current transaction (including whether an “open market CLO” includes transactions such as this one, in which the Issuer is permitted to acquire bonds in addition to loans. However, consistent with an “open market CLO”, the Issuer is expected to acquire any bonds pursuant to arms-length negotiations in the open market. There can be no assurance that the federal agencies responsible for the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will not seek to distinguish this transaction from the open market CLOs covered by the LSTA Decision and apply the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to this transaction.",p,p
"No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for the type of transaction contemplated herein, and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,p
"If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"In the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuers’ ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to any consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Noteholders).",p,p
Recent developments concerning the treatment of CLOs for certain Japanese investors,p,uncertain
,p,p
"On March 15, 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitisation Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitisation Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitisation exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitisation, including the establishment and utilisation of a due diligence system for evaluating securitised products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitisation transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitisation Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organisation of the securitised product,” retains at least 5% of the securitised exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitisation Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5% retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitised exposures”).",p,p
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Refinancing Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.,p,p
"The JFSA Securitisation Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.",p,p
"Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining Subordinated Notes with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
"Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed,” that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
"It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitisation Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
2.4 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Collateral Manager in Order to Comply with EU Risk Retention,p,uncertain
" The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - Transparency Requirements” above is that affected investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will continue to hold and retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation. The five per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount. The Retention Holder has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding multiplied by the price at which such Subordinated Notes were purchased by the Retention Holder being, at any time, an amount equal to or greater than 5 per cent. of the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount.",p,p
 Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.,p,p
" In particular, if, at any time, the deposit of Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency, such Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments will instead be deposited into the Interest Account. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds if the reinvestment of such amount would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In addition, the Collateral Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Obligations where such reinvestment would cause a Retention Deficiency. As a result, the Collateral Manager may be prevented from reinvesting available proceeds in Collateral Obligations in circumstances where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise have been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.",p,p
" Also, the Issuer may not issue further Notes without the Retention Holder (a) consenting to such issuance and (b) subscribing for sufficient Subordinated Notes so as not to result in non- compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.",p,p
"As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.",p,p
2.5 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),p,uncertain
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are “non-financial counterparties” (or third country entities equivalent to “financial counterparties” or “non-financial counterparties”).",p,p
Financial counterparties (“FCs”) (as defined in EMIR) are subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC,p,p
"derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”), and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). As further discussed in “Margin requirements” below, FCs must exchange margin in respect of all non-cleared OTC derivatives unless such OTC derivatives are excluded from the scope of the relevant margin rules (the “margin requirement”). To the extent that the Issuer becomes FC, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements or restricting of their terms.",p,p
"Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (as well as the margin requirement) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group”, excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non- financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,p
"Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards. Whilst regulatory technical standards have been published in respect of certain classes of OTC derivative contracts, others are yet to be proposed.",p,p
Clearing obligation,p,title
,p,p
"The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under “Category 1”) to 21 December 2018 (for non- financial counterparties that are not AIFs grouped under “Category 4”).",p,p
Margin requirements,p,title
,p,p
"On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the “RTS”). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.",p,p
"The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin.",p,p
"If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and",p,p
"currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Collateral Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.",p,p
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.,p,p
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to amend the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in future.",p,p
"Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non- financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Currency Hedge Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"Prospective investors should also be aware that on 4 May 2017, the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation amending EMIR as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (the “EMIR Refit”).",p,p
"The final version of EMIR REFIT was published in the EU Official Journal on 28 May 2019, with the majority of the amendments to EMIR coming into force from 17 June 2019.",p,uncertain
"The most significant amendment in EMIR REFIT is the change to the definition of financial counterparty (“FC”). EMIR REFIT brings into that definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”). Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be non-financial counterparties (“NFCs”) if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds would be out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs. Under the amended definition of a FC in EMIR REFIT, such funds will now be regarded as TCEs that would be FCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that EU FCs will be required to ensure compliance with the clearing obligation and margin requirements for uncleared derivatives in respect of their trading with such funds.",p,p
"Despite the initial proposal by the European Commission including securitisation special purpose entities (“SSPEs”, defined by reference to the AIFMD) in the revised financial counterparty definition, the final version published in the Official Journal instead provides a specific exclusion for such entities from categorisation as a financial counterparty.",p,p
"EMIR REFIT also amends the clearing obligation through the introduction of a new category of “small financial counterparty”, subject to similar clearing thresholds as non-financial counterparties. Another amendment provides that where the clearing threshold has been exceeded by a non-financial counterparty in one asset category, that non-financial counterparty will only have to clear derivatives in that category, rather than for all asset categories (as was the case in the original EMIR). Other amendments in EMIR REFIT include a relaxation of the reporting requirements for non-financial counterparties below the clearing threshold, the imposition of a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms” access standard for clearing members providing clearing services and new powers for ESMA and the Commission to suspend the clearing obligation for certain classes of derivative.",p,p
2.6 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,p,uncertain
"EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. The Collateral Manager would not be permitted to be authorised under both AIFMD and under MiFID II. It would therefore not be able to apply for authorisation under AIFMD unless it ceases to maintain its current MiFID II (in which case it may not be able to hold the retention as a “sponsor” as required under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (see “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - Transparency Requirements” above)). If considered to be an AIF managed by an AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR Refit, all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.",p,p
There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”). The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it.,p,uncertain
"If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.",p,p
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.",p,p
2.7 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,p,title
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.",p,p
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new Offering Circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
2.8 U.S. Swap Regulations,p,title
"Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) and the availability of such Hedge Transactions (for example the recent CFTC final rules on margining). Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and in some cases traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps, (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,p
"Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but have yet to become effective. It is expected that such regulations will become effective in the next two years, but the SEC has yet to set a compliance date. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.",p,p
2.9 Commodity Pool Regulation,p,title
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements should not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its directors, officers or employees to register with the CFTC as a CPO or a CTA.",p,p
"In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5 per cent. of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100 per cent. of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs.",p,p
Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.,p,p
"Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.",p,p
"Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,p
"Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.",p,p
2.10 Volcker Rule,p,title
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.",p,p
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,p
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see “Commodity Pool Regulation”, above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.",p,p
"The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders’ rights in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement Collateral Manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.",p,p
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,p
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund” the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Refinancing Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"In 2018, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations not relevant to this transaction. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitizations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule’s covered fund provisions. Two of the agencies – the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – adopted in final form final regulations consistent with the 2018 proposal, and the remaining three agencies are expected to approve the changes shortly. In connection with the adoption of these final regulations, the agencies stated that further proposed amendments may be forthcoming, including modifications to the provisions related to “covered funds”. It is unclear at this time what changes (if any) ultimately will be made to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Refinancing Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Collateral Manager.",p,p
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Refinancing Notes. Each prospective investor in the Refinancing Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Refinancing Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.,p,p
2.11 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,p,uncertain
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Refinancing Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Refinancing Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,p
2.12 Flip Clauses,p,title
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment (such as the Priorities of Payment) which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,p
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,p
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,p
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY Case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,p
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,p
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priority of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,p

The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU",p,p
"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds.

"Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.",p,p
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):,p,uncertain
"(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and",p,p
"(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.",p,p
Investors should be aware that:,p,title
"(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”;",p,p
"(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,p

"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,uncertain
"(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;",p,p
"(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Rated Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fallback mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented within the timescale provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and",p,p

However, on 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.",p,p

The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.",p,p
"Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain.",p,p

2.17 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,p,uncertain
"On 5 October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,p
"The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” (“LOB”) rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.",p,p
"The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.",p,p
"On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included The Netherlands and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.",p,p
"The United Kingdom and The Netherlands signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 June 2018 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. On 29 March 2019, The Netherlands deposited its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval with the OECD and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of The Netherlands on 1 July 2019. The changes made by the Multilateral Instrument to the CTA do not have effect immediately following entry into force with respect to The Netherlands (except for the mutual agreement and arbitration provisions, which will generally apply to cases presented on or after 1 July 2019) but, instead, apply to taxes withheld at source, and for the purposes of all other taxes, from 1 January 2020.",p,p
Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument the United Kingdom and The Netherlands each deposited a list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties The Netherlands has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions by the inclusion of a PPT.,p,p
"In particular it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to the UK/The Netherlands double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of The Netherlands, in denying the Issuer the benefit of The Netherlands’ network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.",p,p
It is also possible that The Netherlands will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.,p,p
"Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti- Tax Avoidance Directive 2)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.",p,p
2.18 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2,p,uncertain
"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive must be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.",p,p
"Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward.",p,p
"The implementation of the abovementioned interest deductibility limitation rule in The Netherlands has entered into effect on 1 January 2019. The interest deductibility limitation rule adopted in The Netherlands is more strict than prescribed by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, reducing the threshold for deductible interest to EUR 1,000,000 (instead of EUR 3,000,000) and eliminating a number of safe harbours that were included in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.",p,p
"However, the restriction on interest deductibility only applies in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed ""interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets"". Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain.",p,p
"On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches between EU Member States and third countries, which the EU Council adopted on 29 May 2017 in Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (""Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2""). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny or (in some circumstances) delay deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in the case of hybrid mismatches (for example, in certain cases where a deduction occurs in one year and so-called dual inclusion income arises in a later year). Hybrid mismatches are the result of differences in tax law between jurisdictions. For instance, one jurisdiction may qualify a financial instrument as equity while another jurisdiction qualifies the same instrument as debt. As a result, the remuneration paid for the financial instrument may be a deductible interest payment in one jurisdiction, while it qualifies as exempt dividend income in the other. Hybrid mismatches can also occur if an entity is transparent (disregarded for tax purposes) in one country and opaque (or non-transparent) in another country. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 needs to be implemented in the EU Member States' national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and will have to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches, for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will have to apply as of 1 January 2022.",p,p
"A legislative proposal implementing the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 was published on 29 June 2019. The Netherlands intend to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 per 1 January 2020, although some of the provisions (regarding reverse hybrids) will not be in effect until 1 January 2022.",p,p
"Generally speaking, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will only be of relevance in case of payments between related parties; however, Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will also impact structured arrangements whereby the tax benefit of a hybrid mismatch has been included in the pricing (i.e. based on an agreement between two non-related parties). In situations where (i) the taxpayer could not have reasonably been aware of the hybrid mismatch and (ii) does not benefit from such mismatch, a hybrid mismatch that may occur between third parties should not be affected by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 rules. Considering that the Issuer’s main purpose is receiving and paying interest on a regular basis from and to unrelated parties, the implementation of Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 may be of limited relevance to the Issuer.",p,p

2.20 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer,p,uncertain
"The Issuer expects to earn a minimum profit that is subject to Dutch corporate tax but that no Dutch VAT should be payable on the Collateral Management Fees, subject to what follows. This is on the basis of article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT act based upon Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU member states shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” (as defined by the relevant EU member state). There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will not be or in the future become subject to further tax by the Netherlands or some other jurisdiction. In the event that tax is imposed on the Issuer, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes may be impaired.",p,p
"In its judgement of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs C-595/13 (“ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X”) the European Court of Justice has ruled that the VAT exemption for investment management services can be applied to: (i) funds which constitute undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities within the meaning of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive (Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (as amended from time to time) including any implementing and/or delegated regulations, technical standards and guidance related thereto, the “UCITS Directive”) and (ii) funds which, without being collective investment undertakings within the meaning of that directive, display features that are sufficiently comparable for them to be in competition with such undertakings in particular that they are subject to specific State supervision under national law (as opposed to under the UCITS Directive).",p,p
"Following the ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X case, there is a risk that the Issuer may not qualify as a “special investment fund” under the VAT Directive and/or the Dutch value added tax act. The Issuer (and other Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles) has the benefit of a tax ruling from the Dutch tax authorities (which pre-dates the ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X case), confirming that the relevant VAT exemption can be applied for collateral management services to Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including the Issuer, once it is registered with the designated tax inspector). The Issuer has been advised that although case law from the ECJ and Dutch courts confirms that CLO SPVs can be considered sufficiently comparable to UCITS and therefore should qualify as a “special investment fund” within the meaning of Article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT Act and Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive respectively, the Issuer cannot exclude that the Dutch tax authorities may seek to change their position in the future and Dutch value added tax may be imposed on the Collateral Management Fees.",p,p
"On 23 February 2018, the Dutch Secretary of Finance published a policy letter stating the government's intentions to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance. On the basis of these plans, it has been proposed to introduce a withholding tax on intragroup interest and royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions and non- cooperative jurisdictions as of 2021. On 18 September 2018, the Dutch government released its Budget 2019 containing the Tax Plan for 2019, including a proposal for a new Withholding Tax Act (""WTA"") on dividend distributions. According to the proposed WTA, only dividend payments made to group",p,p
"companies that are tax residents of EU blacklisted jurisdictions and low tax jurisdictions (with a statutory tax rate for business profits of less than 7 per cent) are to be subject to such withholding tax. The proposed legislation to introduce a new withholding tax on intragroup interest and royalty payments is expected to be published in the course of 2019. Although on 15 October 2018 the Dutch government decided to postpone the WTA, it is reasonable to expect that the new withholding tax on interest and royalties will eventually become part of the WTA. In the explanatory notes pertaining to the WTA, it was noted that the withholding tax rates on interest and royalties – if applicable – will be the same as the corporate income tax rate (expected to be 20.5 per cent in 2021). Considering that all the relevant publications from the government thus far solely refer to intragroup payments, the debt instruments that are issued in the market and/or listed such as the Notes are unlikely to be covered by the new withholding tax to be introduced.",p,p
"On 17 September 2019 the Dutch government published a legislative proposal for a withholding tax on interest and royalties payments to associated companies in low-taxed jurisdictions and in abusive situations. In principle, the term “associated companies” refers to companies with either a direct or indirect decisive influence on the Dutch resident company. The exact threshold percentage in the future legislation has not been announced, nor do we expect it. Generally speaking, a shareholding of 50 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the voting rights would qualify. Low-taxed jurisdictions are the jurisdictions included on the EU-blacklist of low-taxed and uncooperative jurisdictions, plus jurisdictions included on the Dutch low-taxed jurisdictions list that was published as part of the new Dutch controlled foreign company legislation. Currently, low-taxed jurisdictions include American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, Guam, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrain, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Cayman Islands, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu and the United Arab Emirates. In certain abusive situations payments made by a Dutch resident company to an intermediary company that is not located in a low-taxed jurisdiction may also be subject to withholding tax. The tax rate of the conditional withholding tax will be equal to the regular tax rate of the Dutch corporate income tax (21.7 per cent. in 2021).",p,p

"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.",p,p
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,p
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”) to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.",p,p
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,p
2.25 U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts,p,uncertain
"U.S. regulators have adopted final rules and interpretative guidance setting forth limitations on certain insolvency-related default rights of parties to certain “qualified financial contracts” (“QFCs”) entered into with counterparties that have been designated as systemically important, along with certain of such entities’ subsidiaries and affiliates (each, a “Covered Entity”). Such rules and guidance (the “QFC Stay Rules”) generally require: (i) the Covered Entity to ensure that any stays imposed as a result of the entry of such entity into certain liquidation proceedings are contractually acknowledged by the counterparty to the QFC (in particular, where the relevant QFC is governed by non-U.S. law and/or the counterparty is located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction); and (ii) the Covered Entity to not agree in its QFCs to certain types of cross-defaults that are related, directly or indirectly, to the entry into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding of certain affiliates of the Covered Entity. If a Covered Entity enters into a contract with the Issuer that is subject to the QFC Stay Rules, the Covered Entity will be responsible for ensuring that such QFC complies with the QFC Stay Rules. As a result of the application of such rules, the Issuer may be required to accept limitations in its insolvency-related default rights against the Covered Entity.",p,p
2.26 Centre of Main Interests,p,uncertain
"Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings (recast), which came into force on 26 June 2017, the centre of main interests (“COMI”) shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.",p,p
"The Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands. As a result there is a rebuttable presumption that its centre of main interests (“COMI”) is in The Netherlands and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings applicable to it would be governed by Dutch law. In the decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ restated the presumption in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings, that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect”. As the Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands has Dutch directors and is registered for tax in The Netherlands, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI is not located in The Netherlands and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, Dutch insolvency proceedings would not be applicable to the Issuer.",p,p
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES,p,title
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,uncertain
"Neither the Sole Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of their affiliates) is under any obligation to make a secondary market in relation to the Refinancing Notes. The Refinancing Notes are illiquid investments. Any indicative prices provided by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be determined in the Initial Purchaser’s sole discretion taking into account prevailing market conditions and shall not be a representation by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates that any instrument can be purchased or sold at such prices (or at all). Notwithstanding the above, the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may suspend or terminate making a market and/or providing indicative prices without notice, at any time and for any reason. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Refinancing Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Refinancing Notes or that any available sale price will be at par. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Refinancing Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Refinancing Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors (as the case may be) to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action.",p,p
"Furthermore, the Refinancing Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Refinancing Notes under the Securities Act. The Refinancing Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Refinancing Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,p
"In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.",p,p
3.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,p,uncertain
"The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,p
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may, in some cases, require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,p
3.3 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class.,p,uncertain
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:,p,uncertain
"(a) on any Business Day on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices);",p,p
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices); or,p,p
"(c) (along with the Subordinated Notes) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event at the direction of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution,",p,uncertain
"in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Collateral Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).",p,p
,p,p
"As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders but subject to the consent of the Collateral Manager, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).",p,p
,p,p
Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes should note that their ability to direct or elect for optional redemption of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part by Class) in the above circumstances is subject to the,p,p
"consent of the Collateral Manager at the time, which consent may be withheld in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion.",p,uncertain
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Subordinated Notes. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,p
"The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution).",p,uncertain
"The Collateral Manager or the Retention Holder may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.",p,p
"In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.",p,p
"Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.",p,p
3.4 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Collateral Manager,p,uncertain
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if either (A) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its sole discretion certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) that, using commercially reasonable endeavours, it has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations, or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its sole discretion notifies the Trustee in writing that, as determined by the Collateral Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner, a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event (upon which notification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability). On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
3.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes,p,uncertain
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders,",p,uncertain
"the Class E Noteholders and the Class F Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,uncertain
3.6 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early,p,uncertain
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager notifies the Issuer that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.,p,p
3.7 The Collateral Manager may Reinvest After the end of the Reinvestment Period,p,uncertain
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period” below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,p
3.8 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and a Note Event of Default,p,uncertain
(a) Additional Issuances,p,uncertain
"The Issuer may from time to time during the Reinvestment Period, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Collateral Manager and the Retention Holder, create and issue further Notes (other than the Class X Notes) and use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) to be applied towards a Permitted Use. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,p
(b) Collateral Manager Advances,p,uncertain
The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(k) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Outstanding Collateral Manager Advances may accrue interest at a rate of not more than EURIBOR plus 4.0 per cent. per annum.,p,p
(c) Reinvestment Amounts,p,uncertain
"Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts) by contributing assets to the Issuer either directly or indirectly by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will decide (in consultation with the relevant Subordinated Noteholder but at the discretion of the Collateral Manager) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.",p,p
"Any Reinvestment Amounts contributed by Subordinated Noteholders in cash are required to be in a minimum denomination of €1,000,000 and no more than three such cash contributions may be made by the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the,p,p
"highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations” below).",p,p
3.9 Additional Issuances of Subordinated Notes not subject to Anti-Dilution Rights,p,uncertain
"The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes (other than Class X Notes), subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including that the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. However, this requirement does not apply to any additional issuance of Subordinated Notes if such issuance is required in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency for any reason. Accordingly, the proportion of Subordinated Notes held by a Subordinated Noteholder may be diluted following an additional issuance of Subordinated Notes. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,p
,p,p
3.10 Limited Recourse Obligations,p,title
"The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets including the Issuer Dutch Account and its rights within the Issuer Management Agreement (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders;",p,p
"(e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders; (e) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders; and (f) lastly, the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders (on a pro rata and pari passu basis), in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,uncertain
"In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).",p,p
3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,p,uncertain
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.",p,p
3.12 Subordination of the Notes,p,uncertain
"The Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.",p,p
"The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied towards a Permitted Use in accordance with the Conditions and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account in the event that the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.",p,p
"Non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non- payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment will not constitute a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class C Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class D Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and following redemption if full of the Class E Notes failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class F Notes when the same becomes due and payable, (in each case where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission).",p,p
"In such circumstances, the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default).",p,p
,p,p
"In the event of any acceleration of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders.",p,p
"Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
"The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of the most senior Class of Notes Outstanding. In the event that the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes.

3.13 Calculation of Rate of Interest,p,uncertain
"If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Collateral Manager will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Rate of Interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,p
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Collateral Manager is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis.",p,p
3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments,p,uncertain
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, or to pay scheduled interest on the Class D Notes, or to pay scheduled interest on the Class E Notes or to pay scheduled interest on the Class F Notes or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event such Class is the senior most Class of Notes Outstanding. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available",p,p
"for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,uncertain
"Investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,p
3.15 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited,p,uncertain
"The Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,p
3.16 Ratings of the Rated Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,p,uncertain
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,p
"Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments and do not evaluate the risks of fluctuations in market value, and therefore, credit ratings do not fully reflect all risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, and the credit quality of a debt security may be worse than a rating indicates.",p,p
"Prospective investors in the Refinancing Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,p
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.",p,p
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,p
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations,p,uncertain
,p,p
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the amount described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.",p,p
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the Sole Arranger,p,p

"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,",p,p
"(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.",p,p
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,p
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,p
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.,p,p
Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes,p,uncertain

"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g 10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10, and consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of the Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,p
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,p,uncertain
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling in 17 April 2032 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Refinancing Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Refinancing Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Refinancing Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain",p,uncertain
,p,p
"Estimates of the average lives of the Refinancing Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Refinancing Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or",p,p
"estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,p
3.18 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,p,uncertain
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,p
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See “Mandatory Redemption of the Notes” above.",p,p
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,p
3.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,p,uncertain
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Refinancing Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.",p,p
3.20 Withholding Tax on the Notes,p,uncertain
"Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, under Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer Pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.",p,p
"If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes (including FATCA), the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,p
"In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to",p,p
pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.,p,uncertain
3.21 Security,p,title
"Clearing Systems: Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.",p,p
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through The Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”), Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.",p,p
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.",p,p
"Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,p
"3.22 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",p,uncertain
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,p
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution, or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,p
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum",p,p
and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.,p,uncertain
"Any Notes held by or on behalf of any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution.",p,p
"If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes held or represented by any person or persons who vote in favour of such Resolution represents of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all applicable Notes which are represented at such meeting and are voted and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.",p,p
Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.,p,p
"Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.",p,p
"Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes and/or as applicable, will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.",p,p
"Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.",p,p
"Investors in the Class X Notes should note that the Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions, and the Class X Notes will not, at any point, be or form part of the Controlling Class.",p,p

"Investors should note that for the purposes of determining voting rights attributable to the Notes and the applicable quorum at any meeting of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution).",p,uncertain
"Certain entrenched rights relating to the Conditions including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution, cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.",p,p
"In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).",p,p
,p,p
"Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. The Hedge Agreements may allow a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request. During such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer may not be able to make such modification, amendment or supplement and therefore implementation thereof may be delayed. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification, amendment or supplement of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.",p,p
3.23 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes,p,uncertain
"If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).",p,p
3.24 Enforcement Rights Following a Note Event of Default,p,uncertain
"If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith), give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following the occurrence of a Note Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.",p,p
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting and allowing for any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E",p,p

"The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement (in particular, where paragraph (B) above does not apply) and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests to certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
3.25 Certain ERISA Considerations,p,uncertain
"Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans. In addition, certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.

4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL,p,title
4.1 The Portfolio,p,title
"The decision by any prospective holder of Refinancing Notes to invest in such Refinancing Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and the Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case thereafter as disclosed in this Offering Circular. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time (other than as disclosed in the latest Payment Date Report and/or latest Monthly Report contained in",p,p
"Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto and further described in “Risk Factors – General”). Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,p
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria and, in respect of Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date, the Original Eligibility Criteria..",p,p
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,uncertain
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,p
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.",p,p
"An investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Refinancing Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,p
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priority of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality",p,p
"obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.",p,uncertain
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or the Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,p
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date,p,uncertain
"On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Forward Purchase Agreement to acquire the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations from Barclays Bank PLC.",p,uncertain
"The prices paid for the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations purchased from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement will be the market value (being the price requested by the Collateral Manager (for and on behalf of the Issuer) and agreed to by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement) as at the time Barclays Bank PLC enters into a binding commitment to acquire such assets following receipt of a request from the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to do so for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement. The prices paid for such Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations may therefore be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the time at which Barclays Bank PLC enters into a binding commitment to acquire such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement and the Issue Date (or thereafter), including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations acquired on or prior to the Issue Date.",p,p
"Investors in the Refinancing Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in each such Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation from the time at which Barclays Bank PLC entered into a binding commitment to acquire such assets following receipt of a request from the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to do so for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, including the risk that any Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date may not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date",p,p
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,p
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies at the time of entering into a binding commitment to acquire a Collateral Obligation provided that (i) an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date, (ii) a Collateral Obligation (other than a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation or an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation) purchased prior to the Issue Date must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the date on which a binding commitment to purchase it was entered into and (iii) a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) requested the acquisition of such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement.",p,p
4.4 Considerations Relating to the Subsequent Investment Period,p,uncertain
"During the Subsequent Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, and Portfolio Profile Tests. See “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend on a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager including its ability to identify a suitable Currency Hedge Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Currency Hedge Transactions. See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,p
4.5 Prepayment Risk,p,title
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,p
4.6 Defaults and Recoveries,p,uncertain
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of",p,p
comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.,p,uncertain
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,p
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Refinancing Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes.",p,p
Recoveries on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below.,p,p
4.7 Underlying Portfolio,p,title
Characteristics of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations,p,uncertain
,p,p
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations in aggregate (which shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the borrower in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Obligations are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually",p,p
"have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,uncertain
"Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical senior loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,p
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,p
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Interest Rate Risk” below.",p,p
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,p
"Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,p
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations",p,uncertain
,p,p
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment",p,p
"banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,p
"Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.",p,p
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,title
,p,p
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,p
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,p
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,uncertain
,p,p
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,p
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,title
,p,p
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.",p,p
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by",p,p
investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.,p,p
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,p
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,p
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both",p,p
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.,p,uncertain
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,p
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,uncertain
,p,p
"The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in- possession” financings.",p,p
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,p
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,p
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Loans,p,title
,p,p
"The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Loans. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loans occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,p
4.8 Corporate Rescue Loans,p,title
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,p
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,p
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,p
4.9 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,title
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are subject to the following caps: (i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €3,000,000 and (ii) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all Payment Dates may not exceed",p,p
"€ 9,000,000.00",p,uncertain
The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any,p,p
"right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,p
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.",p,p
"To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, on no more than three separate occasions and subject to a minimum payment of €1,000,000 on each such occasion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (such amount, a “Collateral Manager Advance”) to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,p
4.10 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,p,uncertain
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,p
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,p
"4.11 Participations, Novations and Assignments",p,uncertain
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.",p,p
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower",p,p
"once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,p
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest of the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.",p,p
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above.",p,p
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.,p,p
4.12 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,uncertain
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,p
4.13 Counterparty Risk,p,title
"Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,p
"If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction (see “Interest Rate Risk” and “Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions – Currency Risk” below). For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,p
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.",p,p
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above. Transactions with counterparties that are Covered Entities for the purposes of the QFC Stay Rules may also be subject to the limitations in such rules. See “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.,p,p
4.14 Concentration Risk,p,title
"Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.",p,p
,p,p
4.15 Credit Risk,p,title
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,p
4.16 Interest Rate Risk,p,title
"The Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.",p,p
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above. However, the Issuer will depend on each Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Any termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to interest rate risk mismatch for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty.",p,p
"In addition, some Collateral Obligations permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following a Frequency Switch Event and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations re-set to semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and re-set mismatches.",p,p
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,p
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable, in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank and the Custodian. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance",p,p

4.17 Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions,p,uncertain
Currency Risk,p,title
,p,p
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 25 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limit set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non- Euro Obligation.,p,p
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations are required to be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). Any termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.",p,p
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.,p,p
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.",p,uncertain
"The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,p
4.18 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,title
"To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,p
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds on behalf of the Issuer (see “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of",p,p
"the Reinvestment Period” above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount. Any decrease in the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,p
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Refinancing Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer and the redemption of the Refinanced Notes on the Issue Date as further described herein and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,p
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,p
4.19 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,p,uncertain
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a CCC Obligation, a Caa Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value/Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating. In some instances, the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by S&P and Moody’s. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In",p,p
"addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the S&P Rating or Moody’s Rating is derived from the rating of another rating agency. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.",p,p
,p,p
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations and Caa Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value/Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
4.20 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,p,uncertain
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.",p,p
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.,p,uncertain

"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,p
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable",p,p
"subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,p
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,p
4.22 Loan Repricing,p,title
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,p
4.23 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,p,uncertain
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can be sheltered by application being made under the applicable double tax treaty; (ii) such withholding tax is a",p,p
"U.S. federal withholding tax imposed on letter of credit fees, consent fees, commitment fees or similar fees; or (iii) the Obligor is required to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made,",p,p
"(b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the borrower or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders).",p,p
4.24 UK Taxation of the Issuer,p,uncertain
"In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.",p,uncertain
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Managing Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.,p,p
"The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a fixed place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.",p,p
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.,p,p
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the specific domestic UK corporation tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the “Investment Manager Exemption”) is available in the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available if the Collateral Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the exemption in Article 7(1) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty.",p,p
"Should the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Imposition of such tax by the United Kingdom tax authorities may also give rise to a Note Tax Event pursuant to which the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,p
"The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a ""trade of dealing in or developing UK land"", (b) it disposes of ""interests in UK land"" or certain assets other than ""interests in UK land"" which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a ""substantial indirect interest"" in that land, or (c) with effect from 6th April 2020 it carries on a ""UK property business"" or has other ""UK property income"". However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.",p,p
4.25 Diverted Profits Tax,p,title
"The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent. of any “taxable diverted profits”. The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident",p,p
company’s trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.,p,uncertain
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.,p,p
4.26 Collateral Manager,p,title
"The Collateral Manager, is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.

While the Collateral Manager will be responsible for the collateral management and credit decisions with respect to managing the Collateral on behalf of the Issuer, certain day-to-day discretions relating to the composition of the portfolios of the Issuer as well as authority to execute transactions for the Issuer will be delegated to Ares Management Limited (“AML”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”). In addition, AML will: (i) perform certain middle- and back-office functions for the Collateral Manager; (ii) make available certain individuals to perform certain functions for the Collateral Manager; and (iii) provide the Collateral Manager with certain intellectual property licences. The Collateral Manager procures these services pursuant to a services agreement with AML.",p,p
"In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations.

"The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,p
"The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager (including AML) should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.",p,p
"The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.",p,p

Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,p

The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.",p,p

5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,p,title
"The Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,p
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates,p,uncertain
,p,p
"The scope of the activities of the Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited and the funds and clients managed or advised by Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may invest, on behalf of themselves and their clients, in obligations and/or securities that would be appropriate as Collateral Obligations, as well as in obligations and/or securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations that are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may give advice or take action for their own account or their other client accounts with similar strategies which may differ from action taken for the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also have ongoing relationships with companies whose obligations and/or securities are Collateral Obligations, and may own, directly or through other funds or accounts that they manage, loans, equity or debt securities issued by obligors of Collateral Obligations or other Collateral. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may have provided and may provide in the future certain services (including advisory services) for a negotiated fee to companies whose obligations or other securities are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel may invest, or have already invested, in obligations and/or other securities that are identical to or senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, on behalf of themselves or their clients, may also be active on steering committees of creditors in the restructuring of debt obligations issued by companies whose loans or securities are owned by them or their clients, including the Issuer, which relationships could give rise to multiple conflicts of interest. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may serve as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager of partnerships or companies organised to issue collateralised bond or loan obligations secured by noninvestment grade bank loans. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates may at certain times be engaged in seeking to purchase or dispose of, or may have already purchased or disposed of, investments for the Issuer while at the same time the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates is also seeking to purchase or dispose of, or has already purchased or disposed of, similar or identical investments for its own account or clients or Affiliates or another entity for which it or an Affiliate serves as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager. By reason of the various activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and such Affiliates may acquire or otherwise come into possession of confidential or material non-public information or be restricted from effecting transactions in certain Collateral Obligations or other Collateral that otherwise might have been initiated or prevented from liquidating a position. Such information might also not be known to the personnel of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited responsible for monitoring the Collateral Obligations or other Collateral and performing the other obligations of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral",p,p

At times, the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited, in an effort to avoid restrictions for the Issuer and its and its Affiliates’ other clients, may elect not to receive, or actively avoid exposure to, information that other market participants or counterparties are eligible to receive or have received.",p,p
"Many of the investment opportunities that Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited evaluate for potential investment by their clients or funds may be eligible investments for more than one such client or fund. Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”) and its Affiliates expect to allocate such investment opportunities generally based on factors and other considerations as Ares Management determines in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to: (i) differences with respect to available capital, size, and remaining life of a fund; (ii) different investment objectives or strategies;",p,p
"(iii) differences in risk profile at the time the opportunity becomes available; (iv) the potential transaction and other costs of allocating an opportunity among various funds; (v) potential conflicts of interest, including whether a fund has an existing investment in the issuer in question; (vi) the nature of the security or the transaction including minimum investment amounts and the source of the opportunity;",p,p
"(vii) current and anticipated market conditions; and (viii) differences in particular portfolio profile covenants or other contractual requirements, including requirements set forth in debt agreements of funds utilising leverage.",p,p

The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also make investments on their own behalf without effecting such investment opportunities on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may be bound by affirmative obligations at present or in the future, whereby it or they are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager Ares Management Limited or their Affiliates effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Alternatively, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise simultaneously with or in addition to effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Thus, other funds, accounts or portfolios that it or they manage or advise could become co-investors with the Issuer.",p,p
"The Collateral Manager will endeavour to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities in a manner which it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances. Further, the Collateral Manager will be prohibited under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from directing the acquisition of Collateral Obligations from, or disposition of Collateral Obligations to, its Affiliates or any other account managed by the Collateral Manager except in a transaction conducted on an arm’s-length basis.",p,p
"Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited currently serve as the portfolio managers for a number of collateralised loan obligation transactions secured by collateral consisting primarily of non-investment grade secured bank loans. The professional staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may also provide services to such Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited. Although the professional staff of the Collateral Manager and AML will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited deem appropriate to perform its duties in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s (and Ares Management Limited’s) other accounts and the accounts of the Collateral Manager’s Affiliates. The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, aggregate orders for its accounts under management (or for the accounts of its Affiliates). Depending upon market conditions, the aggregation of orders may result in a higher or lower average price paid or received by a client. There is no assurance that the Issuer will hold the same assets as, or perform in a similar manner to, any other collateralised loan obligation or other client with strategies or investment objectives similar to the Issuer.",p,p
"The Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may, in one or more transactions, effect client cross-transactions where the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and another collateralised loan obligation, fund or account managed or advised by it or one or more of its Affiliates, but neither it nor the Affiliate will receive any commission",p,p
"or similar fee in connection with such cross-transaction. In connection with any such acquisition or sale, the Collateral Obligations will be valued and bought or sold for a price based on a price that is equal to the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. Each of the acquisitions or sales described in this paragraph will be effected in accordance with, as applicable, the terms of the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and applicable law, including, without limitation, the applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”) that govern such transactions.",p,p
"In addition, with the prior authorisation of the Issuer, which may be revoked at any time, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law. The Collateral Manager may also effect principal transactions between itself or its Affiliates and the Issuer.",p,p
"Any transaction effected between the Issuer and the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates on a principal, client cross or agency cross basis will be conducted at arm’s length for fair market value and on terms as favourable to the Issuer as would be the case in a transaction with an independent third party and in accordance with any fiduciary obligation of the Collateral Manager under applicable law.",p,uncertain
"On each Payment Date, the Collateral Manager will be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priorities of Payment if the Subordinated Noteholders have received the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold as of such Payment Date. See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The manner in which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is determined could create an incentive for the Collateral Manager to make riskier investments in the Collateral Obligations than the Issuer would otherwise make in order to increase the likelihood that the Subordinated Noteholders receive the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold for the Collateral Manager to be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee.",p,p
"The Collateral Manager may enter into, amend or terminate side letters or other similar agreements to or with one or more Noteholders or prospective Noteholders which have the effect of altering or supplementing terms described in this Offering Circular as they pertain to the Collateral Manager or of establishing rights not described therein with respect to a Noteholder that has entered into such side letters or other written agreements or instruments vis à vis the Collateral Manager, including, without limitation, varying fee structures and allowing for varying arrangements with respect to the scope and frequency of information provided about the Portfolio. Unless specifically negotiated, other Noteholders will not have the right to review (or to receive the economic or other benefits of) any such side letters.",p,p

The purchase of Notes by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may create potential and/or actual conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and other investors in the Notes. Such purchases may be in the secondary market and may occur a significant amount of time after the Issue Date. Resulting conflicts of interest could include (a) divergent economic interests between the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and other investors in the Notes, on the other hand, and (b) voting of Notes by the Collateral Manager, or a recommendation to vote by the same, to cause, among other things, an early redemption of the Notes and/or an amendment of the transaction documents relating to the Notes.",p,p

If the Controlling Class object as described in the previous sentence, then the Controlling Class, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, shall propose an alternative replacement collateral manager which shall be appointed a successor provided the holders of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution) do not object within 30 days after having been given notice thereof. If no such Eligible Successor has been appointed and approved within 90 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor. If (i) such successor Collateral Manager agrees in writing to assume all of the Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and (ii) the Issuer has not received written objections from the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) within 45 days of such proposal, the Issuer will appoint such proposed Eligible Successor upon the expiration of such 45 day period. If no Eligible Successor has been appointed within 135 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor without any approval or veto right of any Noteholder (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment).",p,p
"Accordingly, there is a risk to Noteholders that the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may take (or fail to take) action with respect to the appointment of a successor that is adverse to such Noteholders and that, if the Controlling Class fails to act (by way of Ordinary Resolution), the Collateral Manager could delay its removal for a significant period of time and obstruct the appointment of a successor following a vote to effect its replacement by voting against any successor and refusing to petition a court when no replacement is found.",p,p
"The Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from one or more funds managed by an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited.

These may have been influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Refinancing Notes or any particular Class of Refinancing Notes.",p,p
"The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Refinancing Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Refinancing Notes. The Initial Purchaser may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Refinancing Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Refinancing Notes and hedging transactions). The Initial Purchaser expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,p
"The Barclays Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The financial services that the Barclays Parties may provide also include financing and, as such, the Barclays Parties may have and/or may provide financing to Collateral Manager Related Persons and/or their respective Affiliates. In addition, the Barclays Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of such financings. In the case of any such financing, the Barclays Parties may have received security over assets of a Collateral Manager Related Person and/or their respective Affiliates resulting in the Barclays Parties having enforcement rights and remedies. In carrying out its obligations as Initial Purchaser or any other transaction party, no Barclays Party shall be under any duty to disclose to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholders, prospective investor or any other person, any non-public information acquired in the course of carrying on any business for, or in connection with, the provision of services to any other party. The Barclays Parties may have positions in and may have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Barclays Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Barclays Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors Affiliated with the Barclays Parties or in which one or more Barclays Parties hold an equity, participation",p,p

The Barclays Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Refinancing Notes.",p,p

"The Barclays Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law.

If a Barclays Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Barclays Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Refinancing Notes. The price at which a Barclays Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,p

RATINGS OF THE REFINANCING NOTES,h2,title
,p,p
General,p,title
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Refinancing Notes that the Refinancing Notes be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class X Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class A Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B Notes: “Aa2(sf)” from Moody’s and “AA(sf)” from S&P; the Class C Notes: “A2(sf)” from Moody’s and “A(sf)” from S&P; the Class D Notes: “Baa3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BBB-(sf)” from S&P; the Class E Notes: “Ba3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BB-(sf)” from S&P; and the Class F Notes: “B3(sf)” from Moody’s and “B-(sf)” from S&P.,p,uncertain
"The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.",p,p
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Refinancing Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency.",p,p
Moody’s Ratings,p,title
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.,p,p
"Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.",p,p
"In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.",p,p
S&P Ratings,p,title
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:,p,p
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;,p,uncertain
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and,p,uncertain
(c) legal considerations.,p,uncertain
"Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied until the end of the Reinvestment Period.",p,p
"S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand.",p,p
"For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,uncertain
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,p
"There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.",p,p
"S&P’s ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.",p,p

"The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Subsequent Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 17 December 2019, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.",p,p
"On or after the Effective Date but prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date, no more than 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (in aggregate) may be transferred to the Interest Account in one or more instalments, in aggregate and without duplication, from the Principal Account; (i) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer into the Interest Account the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (for which purposes the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lesser of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; and (ii) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer each of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (save for the Interest Coverage Tests, which shall apply only on and after the Determination Date falling immediately prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date) is satisfied.",p,p

“Non-Recourse Obligation” means an obligation that falls into any one of the following types of specialised lending:,p,p
"(a) Project Finance: a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of payment and as security for the exposure. Repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.",p,p
"(b) Object Finance: a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties.",p,p
"(c) Commodities Finance: a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet.",p,p
"(d) Income-producing real estate: a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset.",p,p
"(e) High-volatility commercial real estate: a financing or any of the land acquisition, development and construction phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions, where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate).",p,uncertain

"“Step-Down Coupon Security” means a security, the contractual interest rate of which decreases over a specified period of time. For the avoidance of doubt, a security will not be considered to be a Step-Down Coupon Security where interest payments decrease for non-contractual reasons due to unscheduled events such as a decrease in the index relating to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, the change from a default rate of interest to a non-default rate, or an improvement in the Obligor’s financial condition.",p,p
“Step-Up Coupon Security” means a security the interest rate of which increases over a specified period of time other than due to the increase of the floating rate index applicable to such security.,p,p

Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,p,title
,p,p
"The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).",p,p
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):,p,p
(a) an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;,p,p
"(b) an “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;",p,p
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;,p,p
(d) an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and,p,p
"(e) an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.",p,p
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.,p,p

"This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes at initial issuance for cash (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as any alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to- market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the",p,p

This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes. Finally, this summary does not address holders of the Original Notes that acquiring the Refinancing Notes or the tax consequences to a Reinvesting Noteholder of a Reinvestment Amount.",p,p
"Recent legislation may require a beneficial owner of a Note that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. Although the precise application of this rule is unclear, it might require the accrual of income earlier than is the case under the general tax rules described below. Prospective investors in Notes that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situations.",p,p
"PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.",p,uncertain
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer,p,title
"The Issuer is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection the issuance of the Original Notes on the Original Issue Date, the Issuer received an opinion of DLA Piper LLP to the effect that, although no activity closely comparable to that contemplated by the Issuer has been the subject of any Treasury regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including certain tax guidelines referenced therein (the “U.S. Tax Guidelines”) , and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the U.S. Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer",p,p
"could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) to receive advice from nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP assumes the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (notwithstanding that the Collateral Manager is acting in accordance with the",p,p
"U.S. Tax Guidelines). Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,p
"If it is determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, possibly on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. Prospective purchasers of Refinancing Notes should be aware that there will not be a new tax opinion issued on the Issue Date with regard to whether the Issuer was or will be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for",p,p

"Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be received with respect to the Class F Notes. The Issuer intends to treat each Class of the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that one or more Classes of Rated Notes are equity in the Issuer. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules applicable to U.S. equity owners in PFICs or CFCs. See “Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes” below. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.",p,p

Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,p
"If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer will be a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. dollar value of gain on the sale of the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and the U.S. dollar value of certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax.

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.",p,p
"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.",p,p
"Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.",p,p
"Under ERISA and regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, and applicable guidance (the “Plan Asset Regulation”)), if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company,” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or",p,p
"(b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.",p,p
"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,p
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and, to a greater extent, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Issuer believes that the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes may and the Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F",p,p
"Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.",p,p
"Even assuming the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes are not treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, these classes and the other classes of Notes are subject to other restrictions and, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain “in-house asset managers”). There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.",p,p
"Each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more, Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,p
"It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.",p,p

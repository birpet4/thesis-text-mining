In connection with the issue and sale of the Notes, no person is authorised to give any information or to make any representation not contained in this Prospectus and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder or the Collateral Administrator. The delivery of this Prospectus at any time does not imply that the information contained in it is correct as at any time subsequent to its date.
U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a "covered fund", this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Notes.
To permit compliance with the Securities Act in connection with the sale of the Notes in reliance on Rule 144A, the Issuer will be required under the Trust Deed to furnish upon request to a holder or beneficial owner of a Rule 144A Note who is a QIB or a prospective investor who is a QIB designated by such holder or beneficial owner the information required to be delivered under Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act if at the time of the request the Issuer is neither a reporting company under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g 3 2(b) under the Exchange Act. All information made available by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of this paragraph may also be obtained during usual business hours free of charge at the office of the Principal Paying Agent.
On and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period only, if the Class F Par Value Ratio is less than 104.25 per cent. on the relevant Measurement Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account, for the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations (or, if the Collateral Manager determines that it is unable to identify such additional Collateral Debt Obligations that it considers appropriate for such reinvestment, in redemption by way of Special Redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence) in an amount (such amount the "Required Diversion Amount") equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (V) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Interest Diversion Test to be met, as of the relevant Determination Date after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments.
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is , a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency , of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.
U.S. Risk Retention Rules would apply to any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date or, potentially, but subject to specific exceptions, any Refinancing, if such subsequent issuance or Refinancing occurs on or after the effective date of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. In addition, the SEC has indicated in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that an "offer" or "sale" of securities may arise when amendments to securities are so material as to require holders to make a new "investment decision" with respect to such securities. Thus, if the SEC were to take a similar position with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such rules could apply to material amendments to the terms of the Notes, to the extent such amendments require investors to make a new investment decision with respect to the Notes. As a result, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may adversely affect the Issuer (and the performance and market value of the Notes) if the Issuer is unable to undertake any such additional issuance or Refinancing or other material amendment and may affect the liquidity of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules would have any future material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or on the market value or liquidity of the Notes and no assurance can be made that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to the economic crisis or otherwise, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.
The Collateral Manager may from time to time enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the Retention Requirements and could grant security over, or transfer title to, the Retention Notes in connection with any such financing. Such financing arrangements would be on full-recourse terms. It is possible that any such financing could be provided directly or indirectly by the Placement Agent or by an Affiliate of the Placement Agent. If the collateral arrangements in respect of such financing are by way of title transfer, the Collateral Manager would retain the economic risk in those Notes but not legal ownership of them. None of the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, any Agent, the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that such financing arrangements will comply with the Retention Requirements. In particular, should the Collateral Manager default in the performance of its obligations under any such financing arrangements, the lender thereunder may have the right to enforce the security granted by the Collateral Manager, including effecting the sale or appropriation of some or all of the Retention Notes or, if the collateral arrangements in respect of such financing are by way of title transfer, the Collateral Manager would most likely not be entitled to have the Retention Notes (or equivalent securities) retransferred to it. In exercising its rights pursuant to any such financing arrangements, the lender would not be required to have regard to the Retention Requirements and any such sale or appropriation may therefore cause the transaction described in this Prospectus to be non-compliant with the Retention Requirements. See "Certain Conflicts of Interest – Conflicts of interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates".
The term of any retention financing may also be considerably shorter than the effective term of the Notes, requiring Collateral Manager to repay or refinance the retention financing whilst some or all Classes of Notes are Outstanding. If refinancing opportunities were limited at such time and the Collateral Manager was unable to repay the retention financing from other sources, the Collateral Manager could be forced to sell some or all of the Retention Notes in order to obtain funds to repay the retention financing without regard to the Retention Requirements and such sales may therefore cause the transaction described in this Prospectus to be non-compliant with the Retention Requirements.
NFCs are subject to certain risk mitigation obligations and to the reporting obligations, in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates. NFCs are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations, such as the posting of collateral, as long as they do not exceed the applicable clearing thresholds established by the regulatory technical standard for the relevant class of OTC derivative contracts. OTC derivative contracts which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly related to commercial activity or treasury financing activity of an NFC or the group to which it belongs (the "hedging exemption") will not be included towards the clearing thresholds. If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a "group" (as defined in EMIR) or otherwise no longer makes use of the hedging exemption, there is a risk of it becoming subject to the clearing obligation and such additional risk mitigation obligations, including the margin posting requirement. It may not be possible for the Issuer to know if any of the thresholds have been exceeded or if it has become part of a "group" for the purposes of EMIR and this status in any event may be subject to change.
In the event that the Issuer exceeds the applicable clearing thresholds, it would be required to post collateral both in respect of cleared and non-cleared OTC derivative contracts. The Issuer will be unable to comply with such requirements. In such circumstances, hedge counterparties may be unable to enter into hedge transactions with the Issuer or may result in the Issuer being in breach of its obligations to enter into hedging arrangements in respect of Non-Euro Obligations. This could result in the sale of Asset Swap Obligations and/or termination of relevant Hedge Agreements and/or limit the Issuer’s ability to invest in Non-Euro Obligations or mitigate interest rate risk. It may also require the Issuer to sell some or all of the Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations then held by it. Any such termination could expose the Issuer to costs and increased interest rate or currency exchange rate risk until such assets can be sold within the time period specified elsewhere herein. If the Issuer is, as a result, unable to enter into Hedge Agreements this will affect its ability to purchase Non-Euro Obligations or may result in it being in breach of its obligations to enter into Asset Swap Transactions with respect to any Non-Euro Obligations it has purchased. The Issuer may also be exposed to interest rate risk as further described below (see "Interest Rate Risk" below).
The European Securities and Markets Authority has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a CLO would fall within the SSPE Exemption. If the AIFMD were to apply to the Issuer and the Issuer is an AIF, then it would be necessary to identify its AIFM, which would be the entity which manages it in general and is therefore most likely to be the Collateral Manager. In such a scenario, the Collateral Manager would be subject to the AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Collateral Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Collateral Manager’s management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement as an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. The AIFMD would entail several consequences for the Issuer, notably:
From the Issuer’s perspective, if the Issuer were considered to be an AIF and could not benefit from the SSPE Exemption or any other exemption, the AIFMD would require the Collateral Manager and/or the Issuer to seek authorisation to become an AIFM under the AIFMD. If the Collateral Manager or the Issuer were to fail to, or be unable to, obtain such authorisation, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impairs the ability of the Collateral Manager to manage the Issuer’s assets may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to carry out its investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.
If the Issuer were deemed to be a "commodity pool", then both the CPO and the CTA of the Issuer would be required to register as such with the CFTC and the National Futures Association (the "NFA") by the initial offering date of the Notes. Because there has previously been an exemption from such registration for most securitisation and investment fund transactions, there is little, if any, guidance as to which entity or entities would be regarded as the Issuer's CPO and CTA and thus be required to register. While there remain certain limited exemptions from registration, because the wording of these regulations applies to traditional commodity pools and was not drafted with transactions such as the Issuer and its investment activities in mind, it is unclear whether and to what extent any of these exemptions would be available to avoid registration with respect to the Issuer. In addition, if the Issuer were deemed to be a "commodity pool", it would have to comply with a number of reporting requirements that are geared to traded commodity pools, which may result in significant additional costs and expenses, which may in turn affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. It is presently unclear how an investment vehicle such as the Issuer could comply with certain of these reporting requirements on an on-going basis.
Key terms are widely defined under the Volcker Rule, including "banking entity", "ownership interest", "sponsor" and "covered fund". In particular, "banking entity" is defined to include certain non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking entities, as well as non-U.S. banking entities that conduct operations in the United States either directly or through branches or affiliates, and "covered fund" is defined to include an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), which would extend to the Issuer given its intention to rely on section 3(c)(7). It should also be noted that an "ownership interest" is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of a covered fund as well as through any right of the holders to participate in the selection of an investment adviser, manager or board of directors of the covered fund. The Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose, and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. Providing that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a successor collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default may not be sufficient to ensure that the Rated Notes are not characterised as ownership interests. If the Issuer is deemed to be a covered fund then in the absence of regulatory relief such prohibitions may have adverse effects on the Issuer and the liquidity and value of the Notes including limiting the secondary market of the Notes and affecting the Issuer’s access to liquidity and ability to hedge its exposures.
The Proposed Benchmark Regulation will, if enacted, make significant changes to the way in which EURIBOR is calculated, including detailed codes of conduct for contributors and transparency requirements applying to contributions of data. Benchmarks such as EURIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with these requirements, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.
(b) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a EURIBOR currency or tenor which is discontinued, such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion;
(c) if the EURIBOR benchmark referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Notes); and
If any proposed changes when implemented change the way in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is calculated with respect to floating rate Collateral Debt Obligations, this could result in the rate of interest being lower than anticipated, which would adversely affect the value of the Notes. As the substantial majority of the interest payments due on the Issuer's assets are expected to be calculated based upon EURIBOR and the Notes pay interest based upon EURIBOR, an inaccurate EURIBOR setting could have adverse effects on the Issuer and/or the holders of the Notes. For example, holders of the Notes would receive lower Euro amounts as interest payments if EURIBOR was artificially lower than a properly functioning market would otherwise set EURIBOR. Other negative consequences of the perceived inaccuracy of EURIBOR could include fewer loans utilising EURIBOR as an index for interest payments and/or erratic swings in EURIBOR, both of which could result in interest rate mismatches between the Issuer's assets and its liabilities and expose the Issuer to cash shortfalls. Furthermore, questions surrounding the integrity in the process for determining EURIBOR may have other unforeseen consequences, including potential litigation against banks and/or obligors on loans, which could result in a material and adverse effect on the Issuer or the holders of the Notes. Similar issues could arise with respect to LIBOR.
On 14 February 2013 the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft Directive (the "Commission's Proposal") for a FTT to be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the "Participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. If the Commission’s proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on "financial institutions" (which could include the Issuer) in relation to "financial transactions" (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments).
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK if the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The directors of the Issuer intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.
Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purpose of UK taxation, it will not be subject to UK corporation tax in respect of the agency of the Collateral Manager if the domestic UK tax exemption (the "Investment Manager Exemption") for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) applies. This domestic exemption will be available in the context of this transaction if, amongst other conditions, the Collateral Manager does not have a beneficial entitlement to more than 20 per cent. of the Issuer’s chargeable profit arising from transactions carried out through the Collateral Manager. If this domestic exemption is not available, the Issuer should nonetheless be able to rely on Article 7(1) of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty to exclude a charge to UK tax on its profits resulting from the agency of the Collateral Manager, provided that the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty.
Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it will in certain circumstances have the benefit of an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the relevant Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities (such payment to be made in accordance with relevant Priorities of Payment). The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits if it were treated as being tax resident in the UK (such payment to be made in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payment). If UK tax is imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this may also give rise to a Note Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
Action 6 is intended to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. As noted above, whether the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax may depend on whether it can benefit from Article 7 of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty. Further, it is expected that the Issuer will rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by The Netherlands to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply. The final recommendation of the OECD for Action 6 is that treaties should include one or both of a "limitation of benefits" rule and a "principal purpose test". If a person were not to satisfy either a "limitation of benefits" rule or a "principal purpose test" in a treaty then it could be denied the benefits of the treaty.
If the Issuer were to be denied the benefits of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty and it were trading as opposed to carrying on investment activities, then the Issuer could be treated as having a taxable permanent establishment in the UK. If UK tax were imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, the amount of tax due would likely be significant on the basis that some or all of the interest which it pays on the Notes may not be deductible. Profits from dealings in the Collateral Debt Obligations could also become taxable. If the UK imposed tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this would constitute a Note Tax Event, which may result in an optional redemption (in whole but not in part) of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event). If the Issuer were to be denied the benefit of a treaty entered into by The Netherlands and as a consequence payments were made to the Issuer subject to withholding taxes, and the Obligors do not make "gross-up" payments that cover the full amount of any such withholding taxes, the amounts available to make payments on, or distributions to, the Noteholders would accordingly be reduced. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Interest Coverage Tests and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be determined by reference to such net receipts. A Collateral Tax Event shall occur if the aggregate amount of any withholding tax on payments in respect of the Collateral Debt Obligations during any
The Notes will be issued at a maximum issue price of up to 100 per cent. of the principal amount thereof. The Notes will be offered by the Issuer through Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited in its capacity as arranger and initial purchaser of the offering of such Notes (the “Arranger” and “Initial Purchaser”) subject to prior sale, when, as and if delivered to and accepted by the Initial Purchaser, and to certain conditions. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made on or about the Issue Date. The Retention Notes to be held by the Retention Holder shall be purchased by the Retention Holder directly from the Initial Purchaser on the Issue Date. The Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and which may be different to the issue price of the Notes.
(xi) a Competent Authority, or (xii) a potential investor in the Notes. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Investment Manager) shall appoint another entity to carry out such reporting obligations at the cost and expense of the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the Priority of Payments. The Issuer intends for this Offering Circular to constitute a transaction summary or overview of the main features of the transaction contemplated herein for the purposes of Article 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of IM Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes or IM Non-Voting Notes are, in each case, disenfranchised in respect of any IM Removal Resolution or IM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.
There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretive guidance on the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain (as defined in the Conditions), the Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
beneficial owner the information required to be delivered under Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act if at the time of the request the Issuer is neither a reporting company under section 13 or section 15(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act. All information made available by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of this paragraph may also be obtained during usual business hours free of charge at the office of the Issuer.
IF TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ANY HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL” UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, THE INVESTMENT MANAGER WOULD EXPECT TO BE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”) AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) PURSUANT TO CFTC RULE 4.13(a)(3). THEREFORE, UNLIKE A REGISTERED CPO, THE ISSUER AND THE INVESTMENT MANAGER WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER A CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT TO PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS, NOR WOULD IT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CERTIFIED ANNUAL REPORTS THAT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF CFTC RULES APPLICABLE TO REGISTERED CPOs
(c) in part by the redemption in whole of one or more Classes of Rated Notes (or, if applicable, an entire tranche or tranches of a Class of Rated Notes) from Refinancing Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period if directed in writing by the Investment Manager or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution), as long as the Class of Rated Notes to be redeemed represents not less than the entire Class of such Rated Notes and subject to certain conditions (see Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders or the Investment Manager));
If a holder of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Regulation S Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (but in no case for less than the minimum authorised denomination applicable to such Notes); and (ii) a certificate in the form of part 7 (Form of Definitive Certificate to Regulation S Global Certificate Transfer Certificate) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (a copy of which is provided to the Registrar) given by the holder of the beneficial interests in such Notes.
If a holder of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear
(xi) a Competent Authority, or (xii) a potential investor in the Notes. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Investment Manager) shall appoint another entity to carry out such reporting obligations at the cost and expense of the Issuer, subject to and in accordance with the Priority of
The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, the recent downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating
Prospective investors should make themselves aware of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any applicable legal, regulatory or other requirement, then investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes. Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Laws shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) BlueMountain as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on BlueMountain as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Retention Holder may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on BlueMountain, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.
Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group”, excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.
If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Investment Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.
If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Investment Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.
If the Issuer were to be considered an AIF and an AIFM were to be appointed to manage the Issuer’s assets, such AIFM would need to comply with a number of requirements under AIFMD, including the appointment of a custodian in respect of the Issuer’s assets and compliance with certain reporting and disclosure obligations. Compliance with AIFMD by any such AIFM appointed by the Issuer will involve significant additional costs which may affect the return Noteholders receive from their investment.
If trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Investment Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5 per cent. of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100 per cent. of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Investment Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Investment Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Investment Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Investment Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Further, if the Investment Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Investment Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Investment Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Investment Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Investment Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Investment Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Investment Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Investment Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.
The Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a Noteholder and the source of the payment of subscription monies, or as is necessary to comply with any customer identification programs required by FinCEN and/or the SEC or any other applicable AML Requirements. If there is a delay or failure by the applicant to produce any information required for verification purposes, an application for or transfer of Notes and the subscription monies relating thereto may be refused.
If, as a result of the application of the PPT, the Issuer were to be denied the benefit of a double tax treaty entered into by Ireland and as a consequence payments of interest were made by an Obligor to the Issuer subject to a withholding or deduction for or on account of tax in respect of any payments of interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations, this may constitute a Collateral Tax Event. If a Collateral Tax Event were to occur the Notes may be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) at the direction of (a) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution or (b) the Retention Holder, subject to certain conditions.
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of the most senior Class of Notes Outstanding. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).
If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Calculation Agent will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Floating Rate of Interest in respect of the Floating Rate Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Calculation Agent is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Floating Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Floating Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Floating Rate of Interest on any other basis.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Investment Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if either Rating Agency has not yet confirmed or been deemed to have confirmed its initial ratings of the applicable Rated Notes, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Rated Notes.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of either of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Investment Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Noteholders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), give notice to the Issuer and the Investment Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable.
In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Debt Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Debt Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Debt Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligation.
* If a recovery range is not available for a given obligation with an S&P Recovery Rating of “1” through “6” (inclusive), the lower recovery range for the applicable S&P Recovery Rating shall apply
(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer shall, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder within 10 calendar days after the date of such notice;
5. No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) to (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERCENTAGE IN THE BLANK SPACE, YOU WILL BE COUNTED AS IF YOU FILLED IN 100 per cent. IN THE BLANK SPACE.
If a box is not checked, you are representing, warranting and agreeing that the applicable Section does not, and will not, apply to you.
Each of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, or their respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent that a favourable statutory or administrative 
Even if the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes would not be treated as equity interests in the Issuer for the purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be refunded (or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any), provided that certain required information is furnished. The information reporting requirements may apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Copies of the information returns also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Holder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer’s outstanding equity.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, then any gain or loss realised by the U.S. Holder upon a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes, other than gain or loss subject to the PFIC rules, if applicable, generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules from the date
If a U.S. Holder does not make a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer as described above and is not subject to the CFC rules, any gain realised on the sale, redemption, or other disposition of a Subordinated Note (or any gain deemed to accrue prior to the time a non-timely QEF election is made) will be taxed as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge under the special tax rules described above. See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”.
Phantom Income. U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the amounts that exceed the distributions they receive on the Subordinated Notes. For example, if the Issuer is a CFC and a U.S. Holder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, or a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the U.S. Holder will be subject to federal income tax with respect to its share of the Issuer’s income and gain (to the extent of the Issuer’s “earnings and profits”), which may exceed the Issuer’s distributions. It is expected that the Issuer’s income and gain (and earnings and profits) will exceed cash distributions with respect to (i) debt instruments that were issued with OID and are held by the Issuer, (ii) the acquisition at a discount of the Rated Notes by the Issuer (including by reason of a Refinancing, change to an Alternative Base Rate or any deemed exchange that occurs for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a modification of the Trust Deed) and (iii) the use of interest proceeds to make payments on the Class X Principal Amortisation Amount. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the timing of income and gain on the Subordinated Notes.
Distributions. The treatment of actual distributions of cash on the Subordinated Notes will vary depending on whether the U.S. Holder of such Subordinated Notes has made a timely QEF election (as described above). See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”. If a timely QEF election has been made, distributions should be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) and to this extent will not be taxable to such U.S. Holder. Distributions in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes (as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”), and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, a U.S. Holder will recognise exchange gain
Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Debt Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.
Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. The Issuer will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be subject to the PFIC rules, except for certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC (as described below under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”). U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should consider making an election to treat the Issuer as a QEF. Generally, a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election on IRS Form 8621, attaching a copy of that form to its U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it held its Subordinated Notes. If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. A U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.
Finally, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the IRS if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 5471 with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000. U.S. Holders
the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of each Class and such aggregate amount as a percentage of the original aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of such Class at the beginning of the Accrual Period, the amount of principal payments to be made on the Notes of each Class on the related Payment Date, and the aggregate amount of the Notes of each Class Outstanding and such aggregate amount as a percentage of the original aggregate amount of the Notes of such Class Outstanding after giving effect to the principal payments, if any, on the next Payment Date;
Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of such payments when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that are issued with OID also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of principal payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
U.S. Holders of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest and/or principal payments on their Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
U.S. Holders that are individuals or estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax and special rules apply with respect to the PFIC and CFC rules described above. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax.
(i) Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market and any applicable supporting law, rule or regulation and any Central Bank of Ireland (“Central Bank”) rules issued and / or in force pursuant to Section 1363 of the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) (the “Companies Act”);
5. The purchaser and each account for which the purchaser is acquiring such Rule 144A Notes is a QP. The purchaser is acquiring the Rule 144A Notes in a principal amount of not less than €250,000. The purchaser and each such account are acquiring the Rule 144A Notes as principal for its own account for investment and not for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. The purchaser and each such account: (a) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Rule 144A Notes (except when each beneficial owner of the purchaser and each such account is a QP); (b) to the extent the purchaser is a private investment company formed before 30 April 1996, the purchaser has received the necessary consent from its beneficial owners; (c) is not a pension, profit sharing or other retirement trust fund or plan in which the partners, beneficiaries or participants, as applicable, may designate the particular investments to be made; and (d) is not a broker dealer that owns and invests on a discretionary basis less than $25,000,000 in securities of unaffiliated issues. Further, the purchaser agrees with respect to itself and each such account: (x) that it shall not hold such Rule 144A Notes for the benefit of any other person and shall be the sole beneficial owner thereof for all purposes; (y) that it shall not sell participation interests in the Rule 144A Notes or enter into any other arrangement pursuant to which any other person shall be entitled to a beneficial interest in the distributions on the Rule 144A Notes; and (z) that the Rule 144A Notes purchased directly or indirectly by it constitute an investment of no more than 40 per cent. of the purchaser’s and each such account’s assets (except when each beneficial owner of the purchaser and each such account is a QP). The purchaser understands and agrees that any purported transfer of the Rule 144A Notes to a purchaser that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph (5) will be of no force and effect, will be void ab initio and the Issuer will have the right to direct the purchaser to transfer its Rule 144A Notes to a Person who meets the foregoing criteria.
CONSENT FROM ITS BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHEN THE PURCHASER IS A PRIVATE INVESTMENT COMPANY FORMED BEFORE APRIL 30, 1996, (Y) IS NOT A BROKER-DEALER THAT OWNS AND INVESTS ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS LESS THAN $25,000,000 IN SECURITIES OF UNAFFILIATED ISSUERS AND (Z) IS NOT A PENSION, PROFIT SHARING OR OTHER RETIREMENT TRUST FUND OR PLAN IN WHICH THE PARTNERS, BENEFICIARIES OR PARTICIPANTS, AS APPLICABLE, MAY DESIGNATE THE PARTICULAR INVESTMENTS TO BE MADE, AND IN A TRANSACTION THAT MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT LOSS OF ANY APPLICABLE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT EXEMPTION OR IN THE CASE OF CLAUSE (2),
The Notes will be issued at a maximum issue price of up to 100 per cent. of the principal amount thereof. The Notes will be offered by the Issuer through Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited in its capacity as arranger and initial purchaser of the offering of such Notes (the “Arranger” and “Initial Purchaser”) subject to prior sale, when, as and if delivered to and accepted by the Initial Purchaser, and to certain conditions. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made on or about the Issue Date. The Retention Notes to be held by the Retention Holder shall be purchased by the Retention Holder directly from the Initial Purchaser on the Issue Date. The Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and which may be different to the issue price of the Notes.
In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Debt Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer
At this time it is not possible to state with certainty if and when any withdrawal agreement will be entered into, what might be the final terms and effective date of such a withdrawal agreement or the date on which any transition period will end if such an agreement is entered into.
The ESAs stated that they expect Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.
On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). On February 9, 2018, a three- judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Loan Syndicates and Trading Association in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (the “LSTA Decision”). The Panel’s opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on April 5, 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on April 3, 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof.
The most significant amendment in EMIR REFIT is the change to the definition of financial counterparty (“FC”). EMIR REFIT brings into that definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”). Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be non-financial counterparties (“NFCs”) if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds would be out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs. Under the amended definition of a FC in EMIR REFIT, such funds will now be regarded as TCEs that would be FCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that EU FCs will be required to ensure compliance with the clearing obligation and margin requirements for uncleared derivatives in respect of their trading with such funds.
Further, if the Investment Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Investment Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Investment Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Investment Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Investment Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed
As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.
Where Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new Notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing. In addition, a Refinancing may result in a Class of Rated Notes having a shorter maturity date than other Classes of Rated Notes.
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.
The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Investment Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Debt Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as of the Issue Date and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Debt Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Investment Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.

Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (�U.S. Residents�) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate.

Certain entrenched rights relating to the Notes including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of a Resolution cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.
Furthermore, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager is required to carry out due diligence as it considers reasonably necessary in accordance with the standard of care specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Debt Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder (other than in relation to Participations where the Issuer will be the beneficial owner only) of such Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Investment Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Debt Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.

In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above prior to the end of the Due Period in which such proceeds were received shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payment on the next following Payment Date (subject as provided in the proviso at the end of this paragraph), save that the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Improved Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment but for no longer than the later of (A) 30 calendar days following their receipt by the Issuer and (B) the end of the following Due Period; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria

If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
Under EMIR REFIT, NFCs have to calculate their aggregate month-end average positions for the previous 12 months. If the Issuer does not so calculate its positions (or if the calculations were to indicate that the relevant threshold is exceeded), the Issuer will have to immediately notify ESMA and the relevant competent authority and establish clearing arrangements within four months.
AIFMD introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of AIFs. If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR REFIT all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payments are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payments, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.
If as a consequence of the application of Action 6, United Kingdom tax were imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, the amount of UK tax due would likely be significant on the basis that some or all of the interest which it pays on the Notes may not be deductible for United Kingdom tax purposes. If the UK imposed tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this could in certain circumstances constitute a Note Tax Event, following which, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution). See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS.
If any payment was made by the Issuer to a specified person where such payment is not subject to tax in the manner noted above, the Issuer may not be entitled to take a deduction for such payment for tax purposes and the Issuer would be subject to tax on any profits which are treated as arising for Irish tax purposes. In addition, withholding tax may be required to be levied on the payment to the Noteholder.
If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Floating Rate ofInterest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear due to EURIBOR being discontinued (or in the other circumstances referred to in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), investors should note that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager) may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders. See “LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform” above.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the arranger
If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).

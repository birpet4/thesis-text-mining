Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any similar requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisers or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisers and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain.

In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will, at the expense of the Issuer, undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Collateral Manager, reasonably required and in its possession and/or control in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the assistance of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and
Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) or, following an acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) by way of the delivery of an Acceleration Notice (actual or deemed), which Acceleration Notice has been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default), and other than in connection with an Optional Redemption in whole pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, and Principal Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Upon any redemption in whole of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or, following the delivery of an Acceleration Notice (actual or deemed) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default), Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, in each case as described in the Conditions.
The assets securing the Notes will consist predominantly of a portfolio of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds managed by BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC, acting through its Series A entity known as BlueMountain A (�Investment Manager�) or (�BlueMountain A�), in its capacity as investment manager, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement (as defined below). BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC (�BlueMountain�) is a series limited liability company organised under Delaware law and each of BlueMountain A and BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC, acting through its Series B entity known as BlueMountain B (the �Retention Holder�) or (�BlueMountain B�) (through which BlueMountain will hold the Retention Notes) is a series established and existing under Delaware law as part of BlueMountain. BlueMountain A under the terms of the BlueMountain operating agreement is the �originator�, but is not a separately registered legal entity under Delaware law. BlueMountain is the registered legal entity of which BlueMountain A is a series and therefore is considered to be the legal entity that is the �originator� for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.

The delivery of this Offering Circular at any time does not imply that the information herein is correct at any time subsequent to the date of this Offering Circular or any document or agreement relating to the Notes or any Transaction Document. None of the Investment Manager, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for, any matter which is the subject of, any statement, representation, warranty or covenant of the Issuer contained in the Notes or any Transaction Documents, or any other agreement or document relating to the Notes or any Transaction Document, or for the execution, legality, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence thereof.
The Conditions of the Notes oblige the Trustee following receipt of certain certifications from the Issuer, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of the AIFMD (including any implementing regulation, technical standards and guidance related thereto) which may become applicable at a future date.
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the "Volcker Rule") relevant banking entities are generally prohibited from, among other things, (i) conducting proprietary trading activities in a wide variety of financial instruments unless the transaction is excluded from the scope of the rule and (ii) acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds.
In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds. Full conformance with the Volcker Rule was required from 21 July 2015, and relevant banking entities are required to engage in good faith efforts in this regard during the current conformance period. In general, there is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule.
Any of the above or any other significant change to the setting of LIBOR could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under, (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a LIBOR rate and (ii) the Notes.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.
On 5 October 2015 the OECD released its final recommendations, including in respect of Action 6 and Action 7 though some important issues regarding treaty entitlement have yet to be finalised.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.
The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), the Issuer’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.
The market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
The Investment Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds (including by deferring or waiving payment of some or all of its Investment Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations or other Permitted Uses.
The Investment Manager may use funds in the Contribution Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Investment Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Any Noteholder may make Contributions to the Contribution Account pursuant to Condition 2(l) (Contributions) from time to time.
Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the claims, debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders
The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, subject always to the right of the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Collateral Enhancement Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations.
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be an Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.
Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Debt Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; and mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Debt Obligations. None of the Issuer, BlueMountain, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of an Event of Default on or about that date.
3.20 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.
Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.
Any Notes held by the Investment Manager and any Investment Manager Related Person shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights in connection with the removal of the Investment Manager and as otherwise described in the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes that are in the form of IM Non-Voting Notes or IM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will have no right to vote or be counted in any quorum or result of voting in connection with any IM Removal Resolution or IM Replacement Resolution. As a result, only such Notes that are in the form of IM Voting Notes may vote and be counted in any quorum or result of voting in respect of an IM Removal Resolution or an IM Replacement Resolution.
Certain waivers, amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such waivers, amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders. Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Criteria, the Collateral Quality Tests or certain Rating Agency requirements and the related definitions, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained and (to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) the Controlling Class has consented by way of Ordinary Resolution but without the consent of any other Class of Noteholders.
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.
Some of the Collateral Debt Obligations and other assets of the Issuer may be held by one or more subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any such Issuer Subsidiary may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (and possibly a branch profits tax as well) and/or interest and penalties, may be subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax on some or all of its income, and/or may be required to withhold tax in respect of any distributions it makes to the Issuer, and no opinion of counsel will be received regarding the U.S. federal income or other tax treatment of the Issuer Subsidiary. Taxes incurred or withheld by the Issuer Subsidiary may reduce amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Issuer, and available by the Issuer for distribution to investors.
The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual Priorities of Payment which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds as well as certain other investments lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.
The Investment Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Transaction Documents, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
“Step-Down Coupon Obligation” means an obligation which by the terms of the related Underlying Instruments provides for a decrease over a specified period of time in the per annum interest rate on such obligation (other than by reason of any change in the applicable index or benchmark rate used to determine such interest rate) or in the spread over the applicable index or benchmark rate; provided that an obligation providing for payment of a constant rate of interest at all times after the date of acquisition by the Issuer shall not constitute a Step-Down Coupon Obligation
“Cashless Loan” means a loan obligation which is the reconstitution of a Collateral Debt Obligation that does not involve the receipt by the Issuer of a principal repayment in exchange for the new loan obligation. For the avoidance of doubt a Collateral Debt Obligation, or Participation thereof that is the subject of a Maturity Amendment (as defined below) shall not by virtue of the Maturity Amendment alone, constitute a Cashless Loan.
the Investment Manager certifying to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (upon which certificate the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely) that it believes, in its commercially reasonable judgment, that such security constitutes a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation as the case may be.
Any Exchanged Equity Security may be sold at any time by the Investment Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Debt Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Investment Manager) reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, subject to the Investment Manager having made all reasonable enquiries to ensure the same is true, no Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
“Reinvestment Criteria” means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under “During the Reinvestment Period” below and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”.
“Maturity Amendment” means with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, any waiver, modification, amendment or variance (other than in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganisation, debt restructuring or workout of the Obligor thereof) that would extend the Stated Maturity of such Collateral Debt Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, a waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Stated Maturity of the credit facility of which a Collateral Debt Obligation is part, but would not extend the Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation held by the Issuer, does not constitute a Maturity Amendment.
Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Debt Obligations.
Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Debt Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account or the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account at the discretion of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Debt 
Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute Purchased Accrued Interest and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
The Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s), the Collection Account, Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account or the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.
The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Debt Obligations being so purchased.
The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may at any time exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Debt Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall, on behalf of the Issuer, instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment pursuant to a duly completed form of instruction.
In the event that a Non-Euro Obligation is subject to any readjustment, restructuring, refinancing or rescheduling (howsoever described) (a “Debt Restructuring”), then the Investment Manager shall, in any negotiations in respect thereof, take into account the effect of such Debt Restructuring on the terms of any Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of the Non-Euro Obligation.
The Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Debt Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Collateral Debt Obligation is acquired by way of Assignment the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall have complied, to the extent within its control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Debt Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) and as referred to in “Portfolio Profile Tests” below and “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the S&P or Fitch ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.
* As a percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of the third party credit exposure of all such Counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.
The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Measurement Date (save as otherwise provided herein).
Solely for the purposes of determining satisfaction of the Reinvestment Criteria (both during and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period), the concentration limits for the Fitch Maximum Obligor Concentration Test and Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations applicable to the case set out in a Fitch Tests Matrix (or a linear interpolation between any Fitch Tests Matrices in the case of a linear interpolation) selected by the Investment Manager in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs, shall be deemed to be a “Collateral Quality Test” for so long as such case remains selected by the Investment Manager.
The following is a summary of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain other classes of persons such as dealers in securities.
The summary is based upon Irish tax laws and the practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular, which are subject to prospective or retroactive change. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own advisors as to the Irish or other tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Notes including, in particular, the effect of any state or local tax laws.
Relief from Irish income tax may also be available under other exemptions contained in Irish tax legislation or under the specific provisions of a double tax treaty between Ireland and the country of residence of the holder of the Notes.
A Noteholder will not be subject to Irish taxes on capital gains provided that such Noteholder is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and such Noteholder does not have an enterprise, or an interest in an enterprise, which carries on business in Ireland through a branch or agency or a permanent representative to which or to whom the Notes are attributable.
For as long as the Issuer is a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110, no Irish stamp duty will be payable on either the issue or transfer of the Notes, provided that the money raised by the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer’s business.
An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).
This summary is based on interpretations of the Code, regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes for cash at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors)) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax- deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax
Recent legislation may require a beneficial owner of a Note that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. Although the precise application of this rule is unclear, it might require the accrual of income earlier than is the case under the general tax rules described below. Prospective investors in Notes that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situations.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
U.S. Investment Restrictions will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Milbank LLP will not cover such deviations from the U.S. Investment Restrictions. The opinion of Milbank LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that causes or allows the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Milbank LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
The Issuer may hold certain assets in one or more Issuer Subsidiaries, which will be treated as either U.S. or foreign corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any foreign Issuer Subsidiary may be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and subject to U.S. federal income tax (and possibly a 30 per cent. branch profits tax) on a net income basis at regular corporate tax rates, may file U.S. tax returns and reports (or protective U.S. tax returns and reports), and/or may be subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax on some or all of its income. Any U.S. Issuer Subsidiary would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular corporate tax rates, and would be required to file U.S. tax returns and reports. In addition, distributions from a U.S. Issuer Subsidiary to the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax. U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will not be permitted to use losses recognised by an Issuer Subsidiary to offset gains recognised by the Issuer, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes may be subject to adverse PFIC or CFC rules with respect to the Issuer Subsidiary, as described above. The existence of both a U.S. Issuer Subsidiary and a foreign Issuer Subsidiary may, in and of itself, cause the foreign Issuer Subsidiary to be treated as a CFC.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply.
A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class X Note, Class A Note or Class B Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
A U.S. Holder of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, and Class F Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes should apply.
It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Holder’s OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
As described above under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes”, the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes—Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” with respect to its Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes
The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, the Issuer will provide the information necessary for the U.S. Holder to comply with any filing requirements that arise as a result of the Issuer’s classification as a CFC.
U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC, and thus there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
U.S. dollar value of the amount realised. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Holder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a nontaxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.
Receipt of Euro. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Subordinated Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Subordinated Notes.
A participant in a “reportable transaction” is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding.

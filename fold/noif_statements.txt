Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any similar requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisers or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisers and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—Securitisation Regulation” below for further information.

Key terms are defined under the Volcker Rule, including “banking entity”, “ownership interest”, “sponsor” and “covered fund”. In particular, “banking entity” is defined to include certain non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking entities as well as non-U.S. banking entities that conduct operations in the United States either directly or through branches or affiliates, “covered fund” is defined to include an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereof, subject to certain exemptions and exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations (which would extend to the Issuer given its intention to rely on section 3(c)(7)) and “ownership interest” is defined to include, among other things, interests arising through a holder’s exposure to profits and losses in the covered fund or through any right of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of, among others, an investment manager or advisor, general partner or the board of directors of such covered fund. It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose. It is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. Providing that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a successor collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default may not be sufficient to ensure that the Rated Notes are not characterised as ownership interests. If the Issuer is deemed to be a covered fund then in the absence of regulatory relief such prohibitions may have adverse effects on the Issuer and the liquidity and value of the Notes including limiting the secondary market of the Notes and affecting the Issuer’s access to liquidity and ability to hedge its exposures.

None of the Investment Manager, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for, any matter which is the subject of, any statement, representation, warranty or covenant of the Issuer contained in the Notes or any Transaction Documents, or any other agreement or document relating to the Notes or any Transaction Document, or for the execution, legality, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence thereof.
None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, the Trustee, BlueMountain (save in respect of the BlueMountain Information), the Collateral Administrator (save in respect of the section headed “The Collateral Administrator”), any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any other party has separately verified the information contained in this Offering Circular and, accordingly, none of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, the Trustee, BlueMountain (save as specified above), the Collateral Administrator (save as specified above), any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any other party (save for the Issuer as specified above) makes any representation, recommendation or warranty, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, adequacy, reasonableness or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Circular or in any further notice or other document which may at any time be supplied in connection with the Notes or their distribution or accepts any responsibility or liability therefor. None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, the Trustee, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any other party undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of any of the aforementioned parties which is not included in this Offering Circular.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”) where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.
With respect to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction (including the Reports) are sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. None of the Issuer, BlueMountain, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee and/or any Investment Manager Related Person, their respective Affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisors or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such Person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements other than, in the case of BlueMountain, where such failure results from a breach of the Risk Retention Letter (as defined in the terms and conditions of the Notes) by BlueMountain or any of its Affiliates. Each prospective investor in the Notes should consult with its own legal, accounting, financial, regulatory and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain.
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Investment Manager shall on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, provide to the Collateral Administrator (and/or any applicable third party reporting entity) and the Issuer any reports, data and other information (or access to such other information) which (i) is in the possession of the Investment Manager, (ii) is not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on its disclosure, (iii) the Collateral Administrator or the Issuer does not otherwise have access, is not already required to be provided to the Issuer directly, or is not otherwise in the Issuer's possession (in each case, as applicable), and (iv) is required by the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the designated entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities the reports, data and other information necessary to fulfil the reporting requirements of the Transparency Requirements; provided that, prior to the entry into force of final disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements (A) the Issuer intends to fulfil those
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) generally require the “sponsor”, either directly or through a “majority owned affiliate”, to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of a securitisation transaction. In the LSTA Decision (as defined below), the Panel (as defined below) held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Based on the LSTA Decision, no transaction party currently intends to obtain on the Issue Date and retain after the Issue Date any Notes for the purpose of satisfying the U.S. Risk Retention Rules nor will any transaction party seek to satisfy any other requirements (including with respect to disclosure) set forth in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Neither the Investment Manager nor any of the other transaction parties provides any assurance regarding, or assumes any responsibility for compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules prior to, on or after, the Issue Date. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – U.S. Dodd-Frank Act” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules”.
There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretive guidance on the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain (as defined in the Conditions), the Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (“U.S. Residents”) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate. Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Notes in definitive certificated form will be issued only in limited circumstances. In each case, purchasers and transferees of notes will be deemed, and in certain circumstances will be required, to have made certain representations and agreements. See “Form of the Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”, “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions” below.
The Issuer has not been and will not be registered under the Investment Company Act in reliance on Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

The purchaser of any Note, by such purchase, agrees that such Note is being acquired for its own account and not with a view to distribution and may be resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (1) to the Issuer (upon redemption thereof or otherwise), (2) to a person the purchaser reasonably believes is a QIB which is also a QP, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or (3) outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S, in each case, in compliance with the Trust Deed and all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any entity that is a "banking entity" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally.

Notwithstanding the above, if, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Manager, entry into a Hedge Agreement would require registration of the Collateral Manager as a Commodity Pool with respect to, and at the expense of, the Issuer, the Issuer will not be permitted to enter into such Hedge Agreement unless such registration is made by the Collateral Manager. The Issuer will also be obliged to obtain Rating Agency Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless it is in a form in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has previously received written approval from each Rating Agency.

The U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) generally require the “sponsor”, either directly or through a “majority owned affiliate”, to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of a securitisation transaction. In the LSTA Decision (as defined below), the Panel (as defined below) held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that the Collateral Manager has determined that the Collateral Manager will not be required to retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement (as defined below) pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; notwithstanding such determination in respect of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes (as defined below) on the Issue Date, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements.

BASED UPON INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDED FROM A DIVISION OF THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”), THE ISSUER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY POOL AND AS SUCH, THE ISSUER (OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER ON THE ISSUER’S BEHALF) MAY ENTER INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF “SWAP” AS SET OUT IN THE CEA (AS DEFINED BELOW)) FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF LEGAL ADVICE FROM REPUTABLE LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ENTRY INTO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS SHALL NOT REQUIRE ANY OF THE ISSUER, THE DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” OR A “COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR” (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND THE “CFTC REGULATION”) IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER. IN THE EVENT THAT TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL” AS DEFINED IN THE CEA, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EITHER SEEK TO UTILIZE ANY AVAILABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) OR A COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR (A “CTA”) OR REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA. UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO OR CTA, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.

The Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes are issued in subclasses, some of which have voting rights with respect to the removal of, and selection of a replacement for the Collateral Manager, and others of which do not possess such voting rights. Accordingly, U.S. and non U.S. banking entities investing in those classes of Notes will have the option of investing in subclasses that do not by their terms have a right to remove or select the replacement for the Collateral Manager or investing in subclasses which possess such rights. There can be no assurance, however, that owning the Notes of such a subclass without such voting rights (rather than a note of another subclass identical in every respect but for the right to vote to remove or select a replacement for the Collateral Manager) will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer held by U.S. and non U.S. banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule (whether in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes) not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.
The Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”) or may in some cases be represented by definitive certificates of such Class (each a “Rule 144A Definitive Certificate” and, together, the “Rule 144A Definitive Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”), or, in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof.
The Notes of each Class (other than in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes) sold to non-“U.S. Persons” in an “offshore transaction”, as such terms are defined in, and in accordance with Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes”) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”) or may in some cases be represented by definitive certificates of such Class (each a “Regulation S Definitive Certificate” and, together, the “Regulation S Definitive Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (“U.S. Residents”) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate.
Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Other than with respect to the Class Z Notes, Notes in definitive, certificated, fully registered form will be issued only in limited circumstances and will be registered in the name of the holder (or a nominee) thereof. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes may, in certain circumstances described herein, be issued in definitive, certificated, fully registered form, pursuant to the Trust Deed and will be offered to non-“U.S. Persons” in an “offshore transaction”, as such terms are defined in, and in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and within the United States to persons who are QIB/QPs in reliance on Rule 144A and, in each case, will be registered in the name of the holder (or a nominee thereof). In each case, purchasers and transferees of notes will be deemed and in certain circumstances will be required to have made certain representations and agreements. See “Form of the Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”, “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act. Each purchaser of an interest in the Notes (other than a non-U.S. Person outside the U.S.) will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that it is a QIB and a QP and will also be deemed to have made the representations set out in “Transfer Restrictions” herein. The purchaser of any Note, by such purchase, agrees that such Note is being acquired for its own account and not with a view to distribution (other than in the case of the Initial Purchaser) and may be resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (1) to the Issuer (upon redemption thereof or otherwise), (2) to a person the purchaser reasonably believes is a QIB/QP, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or (3) to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S, in each case, in compliance with the Trust Deed and all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

TO THE EFFECT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” OR A “COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR” (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND CFTC REGULATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER. IN THE EVENT THAT TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL” AS DEFINED IN THE CEA, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EITHER SEEK TO UTILISE ANY AVAILABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) OR A COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR (A “CTA”) OR REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA. UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO OR CTA, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.

"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UKâ€™s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuerâ€™s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that (x) if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s and (y) if the Effective Date S&P Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from S&P. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies, or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan upon request therefor by the Collateral Manager; or (ii) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied or the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Collateral Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.

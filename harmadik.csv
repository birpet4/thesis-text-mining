Volcker Rule,p,
"Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the ""Volcker Rule"") relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.",p,
"An ""ownership interest"" is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.",p,
"The Issuer may be deemed to be a ""covered fund"" under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. ""banking entities"" and non-U.S. affiliates of",p,
"U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a ""covered fund"", this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.",p,
"The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and or Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer.",p,
"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any entity that is a ""banking entity"" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally. Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Agents, the Trustee, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future.

RISK FACTORS,h2,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set out elsewhere in this Prospectus, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the ""Terms and Conditions of the Notes"".",p,
General,p,
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Debt Obligations and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in ""The Portfolio"". There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Prospectus carefully and to consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payments. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payments). In particular, payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes. None of the Arranger, the Placement Agent nor the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Prospectus nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Arranger, the Placement Agent or the Trustee which is not included in this Prospectus.",p,
"Significant risks may exist for the Issuer and investors in Notes as a result of the uncertain general economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (ii) the illiquidity of the Notes, as there may be no secondary trading in the Notes. These risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their stated maturity, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans may be volatile, and the level of new issuances may be uncertain and may vary based on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this may increase reinvestment or refinancing risk in respect of maturing Collateral Debt Obligations. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and could further slow, delay or reverse an economic recovery and cause a further deterioration in loan performance generally. Limitations on the amount of available credit in the market may have an adverse impact on general economic conditions that affect the performance of the Collateral. The slowdown in growth or commencement of a recession would be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Adverse macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. It is possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
Suitability,p,
"Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,
No representation,p,
"The information contained in this Prospectus was obtained from the Issuer and other sources, but no assurance is or can be given by the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or anyone other than the Issuer as to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of such information and this Prospectus does not constitute and shall not be construed as any representation or warranty by the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or anyone other than the Issuer as to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of such information contained herein. None of the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or anyone other than the Issuer have independently verified any of the information contained herein (accounting, capital, tax, financial, legal, regulatory or otherwise) and in making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the terms of this Prospectus, including the merits and risks involved. Delivery of this Prospectus to any person other than the prospective investor and those persons, if any, retained to advise such prospective investor with respect to the possible offer and sale of the Notes is unauthorised, and any disclosure of any of its contents for any purpose other than considering an investment in the Notes is strictly prohibited. A prospective investor shall not be entitled to, and must not rely on, this Prospectus unless it was furnished to such prospective investor directly by the Issuer, Placement Agent and/or the Arranger.",p,
The Notes may only be issued or allotted exclusively to a person who has received and acknowledged a warning to the effect that the Notes are only suitable for acquisition by a person who (a) has a significantly substantial asset base such that would enable the person to sustain any loss that might be incurred as a result of acquiring such Notes and (b) is sufficiently financially sophisticated to be reasonably expected to know the risks involved in acquiring the Notes.,p,
"Each person who acquires the Notes will be deemed, by such acquisition, to have represented that he or it is one of the foregoing persons and deemed to have acknowledged the preceding statement.",p,
Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,p,
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payments. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.",p,
Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,p,
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in the regulation of the same may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of derivatives transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,
Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,p,
"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain Member States, rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.",p,
"Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Several countries have experienced or are currently experiencing a ""double dip"" recession and there remains a risk of a ""double dip"" recession in countries which have experienced modest growth over previous quarters and continued recession in countries which have not yet experienced positive growth since the onset of the global recession.",p,
"As discussed further in ""Euro and Euro zone Risk"" below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of the current economic conditions. These risks could include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to f luctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (""CLO"") transactions and other types of investment funds may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is , a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency , of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.",p,
"The result of the above is a significantly more restrictive regulatory environment including the implementation of new accounting and capital adequacy rules in addition to further regulation of derivative or securitised instruments. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral.",p,

Euro and Euro zone Risk,p,
"The ongoing deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, in particular Greece, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, particularly France and Germany, has",p,
exacerbated the global economic crisis. This situation has also raised a number of uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.,p,
"As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the ""EFSF"") and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the ""EFSM"") to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Euro zone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the ""ESM""), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries from 1 July 2013.",p,
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,
"Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. It is difficult to predict the final outcome of the Euro zone crisis. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.",p,
UK Referendum on Membership of the European Union,p,
"On 23 June 2016 the the United Kingdom (the ""UK"") held a referendum to decide on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The UK vote was to leave the European Union. There are a number of uncertainties in connection with the future of the UK and its relationship with the European Union. The negotiation of the UK’s exit terms is likely to take a number of years. Until the terms and timing of the UK’s exit from the European Union are clearer, it is not possible to determine the impact that the referendum, the UK’s departure from the European Union and/or any related matters may have on the business of the Issuer or one or more of the other parties to the Transaction Documents or any Obligor. As such, no assurance can be given that such matters would not adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes and/or the market value and/or the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
Regulatory Initiatives,p,
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the banks, financial institutions, ""shadow-banking entities"" and of the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge imposed on and/or exposure limits to be observed by certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Administrator, the Placement Agent, the Agents, the Trustee nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
Basel III,p,
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (""BCBS"") has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as ""Basel III"") and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio ""backstop"" for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (""LCR"") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (""NSFR"")). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example the LCR requirements refer to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements refer to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires national legislation, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset- backed securities (for example as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of national variation. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements are coming for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through national initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in Europe.",p,
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
Risk Retention and Due Diligence,p,
"Investors should be aware of the EU risk retention and due diligence requirements which currently apply, or are expected to apply in the future, in respect of various types of EU regulated investors including credit institutions, authorised alternative investment fund managers, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings and funds under the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (Directive 2001/107/EU and 2001/108/EC). Such requirements as they apply to credit institutions and investment firms (pursuant to the CRR Retention Requirements) and authorised alternative investment fund managers (pursuant to the AIFMD Retention Requirements) are currently in force. Amongst other things, such requirements restrict a relevant investor from investing in asset-backed securities unless (i) that investor is able to demonstrate that it has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of various matters including its investment position, the underlying assets and (in the case of certain types of investors) the relevant sponsor, original lender or originator and (ii) the originator, sponsor or original lender in respect of the relevant securitisation has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain, on an on-going basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or asset exposures. Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a penal capital charge on the notes acquired by the relevant investor. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required demonstrate compliance to national regulators remains unclear.",p,
"The risk retention and due diligence requirements described above apply, or are expected to apply, in respect of the Notes. Investors should therefore make themselves aware of such requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Notes. With respect to the commitment of the Collateral Manager to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in the section ""The Retention Requirements"" below. Relevant investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the information described above for the purposes of complying with any relevant requirements and none",p,
"of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee nor any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation that the information described above is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention Notes) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU risk retention and due diligence requirements described above or any other applicable legal or regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements. Any relevant regulator’s views with regard to the CRR Retention Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.",p,
"In particular, investors should note that the EBA published a report on 22 December 2014 (the ""EBA Report""). Following the EBA Report, on 30 September 2015, the European Commission published a proposal for a new regulation to re-cast the EU risk retention rules as part of wider changes to establish a ""Capital Markets Union"" in Europe (the ""Securitisation Regulation""). Amongst other things, the proposals include provisions intended to implement the revised securitisation framework developed by BCBS and provisions intended to harmonise and replace the risk retention and due diligence requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) applicable to certain EU regulated investors. There are differences between the legislative proposals and the current requirements, including but not limited to additional requirements with respect to the application approach under the Retention Requirements and the originator entities eligible to retain the required interest.",p,
"It is not clear whether, and in what form, the Securitisation Regulation (and any corresponding technical standards) will be adopted and/or when any such adoption may occur. In particular, the proposed restriction in relation to originators may be adopted in a different and/or more restrictive form to that proposed by the European Commission (including in a manner which imposes jurisdictional limits, as to which we refer you to the risk factor entitled ""UK Referendum on Membership of the European Union"") and/or other changes to the risk retention requirements (including to the technical standards) applicable to securitisations such as this transaction and any affected investors may be made through the political negotiation process and adopted. The compliance position under any adopted and potentially revised requirements of transactions entered into, and of activities undertaken by a party (including an investor), prior to (and, in certain circumstances, on and after) adoption is uncertain. While certain provisions in the legislative proposals suggest that transactions issued prior to the application date of the corresponding regulation would not be subject to the new retention requirements, there can be no assurances as to whether the transactions described herein and any investors in the Notes will be affected, if at all, by any change which may be adopted in any final law or regulation (including any regulatory technical standards) relating to the Retention Requirements.",p,
"To the extent the Securitisation Regulation imposes disclosure or reporting requirements on the Issuer, the Issuer has agreed to assume the costs of compliance with such requirements, which will be paid as Administrative Expenses.",p,
"The EU risk retention and due diligence requirements described above and any other changes to the regulation or the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the Retention Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change (whether as a result of the legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission or otherwise), and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the Retention Requirements or in the interpretation thereof.",p,
"With respect to the fulfilment by the Collateral Manager of the requirements of the Retention Requirements, please refer to ""The Retention Requirements"", ""Risk Factors - Certain Conflicts of Interest – Conflicts of interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates"" and entitled ""Description of the Collateral Management Agreement"" and ""Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives - Retention Financing"" below.",p,
"On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""U.S. Risk Retention Rules"") were issued. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require the collateral manager of a CLO to retain not less than five per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralising the CLO issuer's securities. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules will become effective with respect to CLO transactions on 24 December 2016. While the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will not apply to the issuance and sale of the Notes on the Issue Date, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may have other adverse effects on the Issuer and/or the holders of the Notes. The",p,
"U.S. Risk Retention Rules would apply to any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date or, potentially, but subject to specific exceptions, any Refinancing, if such subsequent issuance or Refinancing occurs on or after the effective date of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. In addition, the SEC has indicated in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that an ""offer"" or ""sale"" of securities may arise when amendments to securities are so material as to require holders to make a new ""investment decision"" with respect to such securities. Thus, if the SEC were to take a similar position with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such rules could apply to material amendments to the terms of the Notes, to the extent such amendments require investors to make a new investment decision with respect to the Notes. As a result, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may adversely affect the Issuer (and the performance and market value of the Notes) if the Issuer is unable to undertake any such additional issuance or Refinancing or other material amendment and may affect the liquidity of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules would have any future material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or on the market value or liquidity of the Notes and no assurance can be made that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to the economic crisis or otherwise, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,
"With respect to the intended fulfilment by the Retention Holder of the Retention Requirements, please refer to ""The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements"" section of this Prospectus.",p,
Restrictions on the Discretion of the Collateral Manager in Order to Comply with Risk Retention and Due Diligence,p,
"The aim behind the Retention Requirements described in ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence"" above is that affected investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. of the nominal value of the securitised exposures. This is calculated based on the Aggregate Collateral Balance (disapplying any haircuts or discounts contained in the definition thereof). The Retention Holder has agreed to comply with such requirement by undertaking to hold Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding as of the Issue Date of not less than five per cent. of (i) on any Business Day prior to the Effective Date, the greater of the Aggregate Collateral Balance and the Maximum Par Amount and (ii) otherwise, the greater of the Maximum Par Amount and the highest Aggregate Collateral Balance recorded from and including the Effective Date to the Maturity Date.",p,
Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion could cause the retention holding described above to be insufficient to comply with the Retention Requirements (i.e. where the relevant action would cause the Aggregate Collateral Balance to increase to the extent where it resulted in a Retention Deficiency).,p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention",p,
"Deficiency. In the event that the Collateral Manager is so prevented, the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes may be less than would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"Furthermore, the Issuer may not issue further Notes (a) without the Retention Holder consenting to such issuance and (b) to the extent any such issuance would result in non-compliance with the Retention Requirements. The Retention Holder may however direct the Issuer to issue additional Subordinated Notes where necessary in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency, subject to certain conditions being satisfied including that other holders of Subordinated Notes shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Subordinated Notes in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the Subordinated Notes each holder held immediately prior to the additional issuance of Subordinated Notes.",p,
"As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the Retention Requirements.",p,
Retention Financing,p,
"The Collateral Manager may from time to time enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the Retention Requirements and could grant security over, or transfer title to, the Retention Notes in connection with any such financing. Such financing arrangements would be on full-recourse terms. It is possible that any such financing could be provided directly or indirectly by the Placement Agent or by an Affiliate of the Placement Agent. If the collateral arrangements in respect of such financing are by way of title transfer, the Collateral Manager would retain the economic risk in those Notes but not legal ownership of them. None of the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, any Agent, the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that such financing arrangements will comply with the Retention Requirements. In particular, should the Collateral Manager default in the performance of its obligations under any such financing arrangements, the lender thereunder may have the right to enforce the security granted by the Collateral Manager, including effecting the sale or appropriation of some or all of the Retention Notes or, if the collateral arrangements in respect of such financing are by way of title transfer, the Collateral Manager would most likely not be entitled to have the Retention Notes (or equivalent securities) retransferred to it. In exercising its rights pursuant to any such financing arrangements, the lender would not be required to have regard to the Retention Requirements and any such sale or appropriation may therefore cause the transaction described in this Prospectus to be non-compliant with the Retention Requirements. See ""Certain Conflicts of Interest – Conflicts of interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates"".",p,
"The term of any retention financing may also be considerably shorter than the effective term of the Notes, requiring Collateral Manager to repay or refinance the retention financing whilst some or all Classes of Notes are Outstanding. If refinancing opportunities were limited at such time and the Collateral Manager was unable to repay the retention financing from other sources, the Collateral Manager could be forced to sell some or all of the Retention Notes in order to obtain funds to repay the retention financing without regard to the Retention Requirements and such sales may therefore cause the transaction described in this Prospectus to be non-compliant with the Retention Requirements.",p,
CRA3,p,
"On 13 May 2013, the finalised text of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (""CRA3"") was published. CRA3 became effective on 20 June 2013 (the ""CRA3 Effective Date""). CRA3 provides for certain additional disclosure requirements which will become applicable in relation to structured finance transactions. Such disclosures will need to be made via a website to be set up by the European",p,
"Securities and Markets Authority (""ESMA""). As yet, this website has not been set up, so issuers, originators and sponsors cannot currently comply with such requirements. The scope and manner of such disclosure will be subject to regulatory technical standards (the ""CRA3 RTS"") prepared by ESMA. ESMA’s advice to the European Commission in this area was released in its Final Report (the ""Final Report"") setting out the final draft CRA3 RTS for consideration by the European Commission on 20 June 2014. The final form CRA3 RTS were adopted by the European Commission on 30 September 2014 and published in the Official Journal on 6 January 2015 and took effect on 26 January 2015 with the disclosure and reporting requirements becoming applicable from 1 January 2017. However, in their current form, the CRA3 RTS only apply to structured finance instruments for which a reporting template has been specified by ESMA. Currently there is no template for CLO transactions. Additionally, CRA3 has introduced a requirement that issuers or related third parties of structured finance instruments solicit two independent ratings for their obligations; and should consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a ten per cent. market share. The Issuer has appointed Moody’s and Fitch as independent rating agencies to rate each Class of Rated Notes. The Issuer considered appointing a rating agency with no more than ten per cent. of the total market share but determined not to do so. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 in respect of their investment in the Notes.",p,

EMIR,p,
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (""EMIR"") entered into force on 16 August 2012. EMIR aims to increase stability in over-the-counter (""OTC"") derivatives markets and includes measures to require the clearing of certain OTC derivatives through central clearing counterparties and to increase the transparency of OTC derivatives. EMIR introduces certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts entered into by certain financial counterparties (""FCs""), such as European investment firms, alternative investment funds, credit institutions and insurance companies, and counterparties who are not FCs (""NFCs"").",p,
"In connection with EMIR, various technical standards have now come into force, however, certain critical technical standards remain outstanding, including those addressing which classes of OTC derivative contracts will be subject to the clearing obligation and the scope of collateralis ation obligations in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared. FCs will be subject to a general obligation to clear all ""eligible"" OTC derivative contracts through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the ""clearing obligation""), to report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the ""reporting obligation"") and undertake certain risk mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not subject to the clearing obligation (the ""risk mitigation obligation""), such as the timely confirmation of the terms of the OTC derivative contracts, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures.",p,
"NFCs are subject to certain risk mitigation obligations and to the reporting obligations, in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates. NFCs are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations, such as the posting of collateral, as long as they do not exceed the applicable clearing thresholds established by the regulatory technical standard for the relevant class of OTC derivative contracts. OTC derivative contracts which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly related to commercial activity or treasury financing activity of an NFC or the group to which it belongs (the ""hedging exemption"") will not be included towards the clearing thresholds. If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a ""group"" (as defined in EMIR) or otherwise no longer makes use of the hedging exemption, there is a risk of it becoming subject to the clearing obligation and such additional risk mitigation obligations, including the margin posting requirement. It may not be possible for the Issuer to know if any of the thresholds have been exceeded or if it has become part of a ""group"" for the purposes of EMIR and this status in any event may be subject to change.",p,
"The process for implementing the clearing obligation is under way but uncertainties about the scope and timing remain, especially in the longer term. The margin posting requirement does not yet apply and, again, the timing for its implementation and more granular detail is yet to be finalised. Whilst the Hedge Transactions are expected to be treated as hedging transactions and deducted from the total in assessing the notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered by the Issuer and/or non-financial entities within its ""group"" (as defined in EMIR), there is currently no certainty as to whether the relevant regulators will share this view.",p,
"In the event that the Issuer exceeds the applicable clearing thresholds, it would be required to post collateral both in respect of cleared and non-cleared OTC derivative contracts. The Issuer will be unable to comply with such requirements. In such circumstances, hedge counterparties may be unable to enter into hedge transactions with the Issuer or may result in the Issuer being in breach of its obligations to enter into hedging arrangements in respect of Non-Euro Obligations. This could result in the sale of Asset Swap Obligations and/or termination of relevant Hedge Agreements and/or limit the Issuer’s ability to invest in Non-Euro Obligations or mitigate interest rate risk. It may also require the Issuer to sell some or all of the Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations then held by it. Any such termination could expose the Issuer to costs and increased interest rate or currency exchange rate risk until such assets can be sold within the time period specified elsewhere herein. If the Issuer is, as a result, unable to enter into Hedge Agreements this will affect its ability to purchase Non-Euro Obligations or may result in it being in breach of its obligations to enter into Asset Swap Transactions with respect to any Non-Euro Obligations it has purchased. The Issuer may also be exposed to interest rate risk as further described below (see ""Interest Rate Risk"" below).",p,
"The Hedge Agreements may contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of such an event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See ""Hedging Arrangements"".",p,
"The Conditions of the Notes oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable at a future date. Further regulations are expected. Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to engage in derivative contracts. As a result of such increased costs and/or increased regulatory requirements, investors may also receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be. Alternatively the regulations and/or associated costs involved could preclude the Collateral Manager from being able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should be aware that such risks are material and that the Issuer could be materially and adversely affected thereby. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respects of the Notes.",p,
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,p,
"The AIFMD became effective on 22 July 2013, although there are transitional provisions which expired on 22 July 2014. The AIFMD provides, among other things, that all alternative investment funds (""AIFs"") must have a designated alternative investment fund manager (""AIFMs"") with responsibility for portfolio and risk management. The AIFMD does not apply to ""securitisation special purpose entities"" (the ""SSPE Exemption""). A number of national regulators have issued policy statements in relation to the implementation of the AIFMD in their jurisdictions, including the Financial Conduct Authority (the ""FCA"") in the United Kingdom and the Central Bank in Ireland. However in providing such guidance, the regulators have referred to the possibility that the European Securities and Markets Authority will, in due course, provide additional guidance on the types of structures which will be considered AIFs and the meaning of the SSPE Exemption under the AIFMD.",p,
"The European Securities and Markets Authority has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a CLO would fall within the SSPE Exemption. If the AIFMD were to apply to the Issuer and the Issuer is an AIF, then it would be necessary to identify its AIFM, which would be the entity which manages it in general and is therefore most likely to be the Collateral Manager. In such a scenario, the Collateral Manager would be subject to the AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Collateral Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Collateral Manager’s management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement as an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. The AIFMD would entail several consequences for the Issuer, notably:",p,
"(a) the Issuer would have to appoint a duly licensed AIFM (the ""Issuer AIFM"");",p,
"(b) the Issuer AIFM would have to implement procedures in order to identify, prevent, manage, monitor and disclose conflict of interests;",p,
"(c) adequate risk management systems would need to be implemented by the Issuer AIFM to identify, measure, manage and monitor appropriately all risks relevant to the Issuer’s investment strategy and to which the Issuer is or can be exposed (including appropriate stress testing procedures);",p,
(d) valuation procedures would need to be designed at the Issuer level;,p,
(e) a depositary would have to be appointed in relation to the Issuer’s assets; and,p,
(f) the Issuer and the Issuer AIFM would be subject to certain reporting and disclosure obligations.,p,
"From the Issuer’s perspective, if the Issuer were considered to be an AIF and could not benefit from the SSPE Exemption or any other exemption, the AIFMD would require the Collateral Manager and/or the Issuer to seek authorisation to become an AIFM under the AIFMD. If the Collateral Manager or the Issuer were to fail to, or be unable to, obtain such authorisation, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impairs the ability of the Collateral Manager to manage the Issuer’s assets may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to carry out its investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.",p,
"The Conditions of the Notes oblige the Trustee following receipt of certain certifications from the Issuer, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of the AIFMD (including any implementing regulation, technical standards and guidance related thereto) which may become applicable at a future date.",p,
"The Issuer would also be classified as a ""financial counterparty"" under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations or other risk mitigation techniques with respect to Hedge Transactions including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty. See also ""EMIR"" above.",p,
U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,p,
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents the most comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act requires many lengthy rulemaking processes that will ultimately result in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations potentially applicable to the",p,
Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the Issuer that transact business in the,p,
"U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. Once fully implemented, the Dodd-Frank Act will affect many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While certain regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, many implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, while other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the Issuer, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.",p,
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway outside the U.S. Certain of these efforts overlap with the substantive provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others, such as proposals for financial transaction and/or bank taxes in particular countries or regions, do not. In addition, even where these U.S. and international regulatory efforts overlap, these efforts generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis. Areas where divergence between U.S. regulators and their international counterparts exist or have begun to develop (whether with respect to scope, interpretation, timing, approach or otherwise) include trading, clearing and reporting requirements for derivatives transactions, higher U.S. capital and margin requirements relating to uncleared derivatives transactions, and capital and liquidity requirements that may result in mandatory ""ring-fencing"" of capital or liquidity in certain jurisdictions, among others.",p,
"No assurance can be made that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,
"Investors should be aware that those risks are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes could be materially and adversely affected thereby. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
CFTC Regulations,p,
"Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") has promulgated a range of new regulatory requirements (the ""CFTC Regulations"") that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and in some cases traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial and variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation requirements as may otherwise be required with respect to uncleared swaps,",p,
"(iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Debt Obligations, have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,
Commodity Pool Regulation,p,
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a ""commodity pool"" as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (""CEA"") and the Collateral Manager to be a ""commodity pool operator"" (""CPO"") as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a ""commodity pool"" to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in ""commodity interests"" which includes swaps. CPOs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Similarly, the term ""commodity pool operator"" was",p,
"expanded to include any person engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool or similar enterprise and in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds, securities or property for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including any swaps. The CFTC has taken an extremely expansive interpretation of these definitions, and has expressed the view that entering into a single swap (apparently without distinguishing between trading and holding a swap position) could make an entity a ""commodity pool"" subject to regulation under the CEA. It should also be noted that the definition of ""swaps"" under the Dodd-Frank Act is itself extremely broad, and expressly includes interest rate swaps, currency swaps and total return swaps. Although the CFTC has provided guidance that certain securitisation transactions, including CLOs, will be excluded from the definition of ""commodity pool"", it is unclear if such exclusion will apply to all CLOs and, in certain instances, the collateral manager of a CLO may be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC or apply for an exemption from registration. In addition, no assurance can be made that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,
"If the Issuer were deemed to be a ""commodity pool"", then both the CPO and the CTA of the Issuer would be required to register as such with the CFTC and the National Futures Association (the ""NFA"") by the initial offering date of the Notes. Because there has previously been an exemption from such registration for most securitisation and investment fund transactions, there is little, if any, guidance as to which entity or entities would be regarded as the Issuer's CPO and CTA and thus be required to register. While there remain certain limited exemptions from registration, because the wording of these regulations applies to traditional commodity pools and was not drafted with transactions such as the Issuer and its investment activities in mind, it is unclear whether and to what extent any of these exemptions would be available to avoid registration with respect to the Issuer. In addition, if the Issuer were deemed to be a ""commodity pool"", it would have to comply with a number of reporting requirements that are geared to traded commodity pools, which may result in significant additional costs and expenses, which may in turn affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. It is presently unclear how an investment vehicle such as the Issuer could comply with certain of these reporting requirements on an on-going basis.",p,
"Furthermore, even if an exemption were available, the limits imposed by such exemption may prevent the Issuer from entering into Hedge Transactions, having the effect of limiting the Issuer’s ability to invest in Non-Euro Obligations and put it in breach of its obligation to enter into Asset Swap Transactions with respect to any Non-Euro Obligations it has purchased. The inability to enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions will also limit the Issuer's ability to hedge any interest rate mismatch between the Collateral Debt Obligations and the Notes, thereby in some cases limiting its ability to invest in Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations. Any termination of a Hedge Agreement would expose the Issuer to costs and increased interest rate or currency exchange rate risk until the hedged assets can be sold (in respect of which, see ""Interest Rate Risk"" and ""Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations"" below).",p,
"In light of the foregoing, the Collateral Manager will not permit the Issuer to enter into a Hedge Agreement or any other similar agreement that could fall within the definition of ""swap"" as set out in the CEA until such time as it shall have received legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that none of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates or any other person should be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer or that if required to register that the Issuer and/or Collateral Manager (as applicable) did so register.",p,
Volcker Rule,p,
"Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the ""Volcker Rule"") relevant banking entities are generally prohibited from, among other things, (i) conducting proprietary trading activities in a wide variety of financial instruments unless the transaction is excluded from the scope of the rule and (ii) acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds.",p,
"In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds. Full conformance with the Volcker Rule was required from 21 July 2015, and relevant banking entities are required to engage in good faith efforts in this regard during the current conformance period. In general, there is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule.",p,
"Key terms are widely defined under the Volcker Rule, including ""banking entity"", ""ownership interest"", ""sponsor"" and ""covered fund"". In particular, ""banking entity"" is defined to include certain non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking entities, as well as non-U.S. banking entities that conduct operations in the United States either directly or through branches or affiliates, and ""covered fund"" is defined to include an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7), which would extend to the Issuer given its intention to rely on section 3(c)(7). It should also be noted that an ""ownership interest"" is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of a covered fund as well as through any right of the holders to participate in the selection of an investment adviser, manager or board of directors of the covered fund. The Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose, and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. Providing that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a successor collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default may not be sufficient to ensure that the Rated Notes are not characterised as ownership interests. If the Issuer is deemed to be a covered fund then in the absence of regulatory relief such prohibitions may have adverse effects on the Issuer and the liquidity and value of the Notes including limiting the secondary market of the Notes and affecting the Issuer’s access to liquidity and ability to hedge its exposures.",p,
"The Transaction Documents have been drafted in a manner so as to disenfranchise the holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. There can be no assurance that these steps will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule (whether in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or otherwise) not being characterised as an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer.",p,
"The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may restrict the ability of relevant individual prospective purchasers to invest in the Notes and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Each investor is responsible for analysing its own position under the Volcker Rule and any similar measures and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent or the Arranger makes any representation regarding such position, including with respect to the ability of any investor to acquire or hold the Notes of any Class (including the Rated Notes), now or at any time in the future.",p,
Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,p,
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
Flip Clauses,p,
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (""flip clauses""), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the ""anti-deprivation"" principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trus tee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision ""directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts"". While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard. There remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses. Given the current state of U.S. and English law, this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payments, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payments would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payments are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payments, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,
Proposals to reform LIBOR,p,
"The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") is currently being reformed, including (i) as of 1 February 2014, the replacement of the BBA with ICE Benchmark Administration Limited as LIBOR administrator, (ii) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated, and (iii) changes in the way that LIBOR is calculated, by compelling more banks to provide LIBOR submissions and basing these submissions on actual transaction data. Investors should be aware that:",p,
"(a) any of these changes or any other changes to LIBOR could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
(b) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a currency or tenor which is discontinued:,p,
"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affec ted Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,
"(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Debt Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay to the Hedge Counterparty under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Debt Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the applicable Hedge Agreement; and",p,
(c) the administrator of LIBOR will not have any direct involvement in the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of LIBOR without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes.,p,
"Any of the above or any other significant change to the setting of LIBOR could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under, (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a LIBOR rate and (ii) the Notes.",p,
Proposals to Reform EURIBOR and other Benchmark Indices,p,
"The Euro Interbank Offered Rate as used in this paragraph (""EURIBOR"") and other so-called ""benchmarks"" are the subject of proposals for reform by a number of international authorities and other bodies. In September 2013, the European Commission published a proposed regulation (the ""Proposed Benchmark Regulation"") on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Proposed Benchmark Regulation is expected to apply from the end of 2017.",p,
"The Proposed Benchmark Regulation will, if enacted, make significant changes to the way in which EURIBOR is calculated, including detailed codes of conduct for contributors and transparency requirements applying to contributions of data. Benchmarks such as EURIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with these requirements, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.",p,
Investors should be aware that:,p,
"(a) any of these changes or any other changes to EURIBOR could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
"(b) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a EURIBOR currency or tenor which is discontinued, such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion;",p,
"(c) if the EURIBOR benchmark referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Notes); and",p,
(d) the administrator of EURIBOR will not have any involvement in the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of EURIBOR without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes.,p,
"Any of the above or any other significant changes to LIBOR, EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a LIBOR, EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes.",p,
"If any proposed changes when implemented change the way in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is calculated with respect to floating rate Collateral Debt Obligations, this could result in the rate of interest being lower than anticipated, which would adversely affect the value of the Notes. As the substantial majority of the interest payments due on the Issuer's assets are expected to be calculated based upon EURIBOR and the Notes pay interest based upon EURIBOR, an inaccurate EURIBOR setting could have adverse effects on the Issuer and/or the holders of the Notes. For example, holders of the Notes would receive lower Euro amounts as interest payments if EURIBOR was artificially lower than a properly functioning market would otherwise set EURIBOR. Other negative consequences of the perceived inaccuracy of EURIBOR could include fewer loans utilising EURIBOR as an index for interest payments and/or erratic swings in EURIBOR, both of which could result in interest rate mismatches between the Issuer's assets and its liabilities and expose the Issuer to cash shortfalls. Furthermore, questions surrounding the integrity in the process for determining EURIBOR may have other unforeseen consequences, including potential litigation against banks and/or obligors on loans, which could result in a material and adverse effect on the Issuer or the holders of the Notes. Similar issues could arise with respect to LIBOR.",p,
"Financial Transaction Tax (""FTT"")",p,
"On 14 February 2013 the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft Directive (the ""Commission's Proposal"") for a FTT to be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the ""Participating Member States""). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. If the Commission’s proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on ""financial institutions"" (which could include the Issuer) in relation to ""financial transactions"" (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments).",p,
"Under the Commission’s proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is ""established"" in a Participating Member State. Under the Commision’s Proposal, the FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be ""established"", in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the financial transaction is issued in a Participating Member State.",p,
The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Issuer with respect to certain transactions if it is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Examples of such transactions are the conclusion of a derivative contract in the context of the Issuer’s hedging arrangements or the purchase or sale of securities (such as charged assets) or the exercise/settlement of a warrant. Any such tax liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and may result in investors receiving less than expected in respect of the Notes. It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions by investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. There is however uncertainty in relation to the intended scope of this exemption for certain money market instruments and structured issues.,p,
"However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.",p,
United Kingdom Corporation Tax Treatment of the Issuer,p,
"In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) incorporated or tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.",p,
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK if the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The directors of the Issuer intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.,p,
"The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK through which its business is wholly or partly carried on or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a fixed place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to habitually exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.,p,
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purpose of UK taxation, it will not be subject to UK corporation tax in respect of the agency of the Collateral Manager if the domestic UK tax exemption (the ""Investment Manager Exemption"") for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) applies. This domestic exemption will be available in the context of this transaction if, amongst other conditions, the Collateral Manager does not have a beneficial entitlement to more than 20 per cent. of the Issuer’s chargeable profit arising from transactions carried out through the Collateral Manager. If this domestic exemption is not available, the Issuer should nonetheless be able to rely on Article 7(1) of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty to exclude a charge to UK tax on its profits resulting from the agency of the Collateral Manager, provided that the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty.",p,
"Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it will in certain circumstances have the benefit of an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the relevant Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities (such payment to be made in accordance with relevant Priorities of Payment). The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits if it were treated as being tax resident in the UK (such payment to be made in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payment). If UK tax is imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this may also give rise to a Note Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).",p,
United Kingdom Diverted Profits Tax,p,
"With effect from 1 April 2015 a new tax has been introduced in the United Kingdom called the ""diverted profits tax"", which is charged at a rate of 25 per cent. on any ""taxable diverted profits"". The tax may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom for corporation tax purposes through a permanent establishment or where arrangements involve entities or transactions lacking economic substance. The diverted profits tax is a new tax and its scope and the basis upon which it will be applied by HM Revenue & Customs remains uncertain. Imposition of such tax by the United Kingdom tax authorities may also give rise to a Note Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).",p,
OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,p,
"International and domestic fiscal and taxation policy and practice is constantly evolving and at present the pace of evolution has been quickened due to a number of developments which include, but are not limited to, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (""BEPS"").",p,
"In July 2013 the OECD published its Action Plan on BEPS, which proposed fifteen actions intended to counter international tax base erosion and profit shifting. The focus of one of the action points (""Action 6"") is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The definition of ""permanent establishment"" and the scope of the exemption for an ""agent of independent status"" have also been considered under action point 7 (""Action 7""). Other action points may affect the tax position of the Issuer.",p,
"On 5 October 2015 the OECD released its final recommendations, including in respect of Action 6 and Action 7 though some important issues regarding treaty entitlement have yet to be finalised.",p,
Action 6,p,
"Action 6 is intended to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. As noted above, whether the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax may depend on whether it can benefit from Article 7 of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty. Further, it is expected that the Issuer will rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by The Netherlands to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply. The final recommendation of the OECD for Action 6 is that treaties should include one or both of a ""limitation of benefits"" rule and a ""principal purpose test"". If a person were not to satisfy either a ""limitation of benefits"" rule or a ""principal purpose test"" in a treaty then it could be denied the benefits of the treaty.",p,
"The final form of a ""limitation of benefits"" rule is not yet certain. The recommended ""principal purpose test"" would deny a treaty benefit where it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is unclear how a ""principal purpose test"", if adopted, would be applied by the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which payments are made to the Issuer. Further, the OECD has noted that further work needs to be undertaken during 2016 in relation to the treaty entitlement of funds that are not collective investment vehicles. This work may be relevant to the treaty entitlement of the Issuer.",p,
"If the Issuer were to be denied the benefits of the UK-Netherlands double tax treaty and it were trading as opposed to carrying on investment activities, then the Issuer could be treated as having a taxable permanent establishment in the UK. If UK tax were imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, the amount of tax due would likely be significant on the basis that some or all of the interest which it pays on the Notes may not be deductible. Profits from dealings in the Collateral Debt Obligations could also become taxable. If the UK imposed tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this would constitute a Note Tax Event, which may result in an optional redemption (in whole but not in part) of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event). If the Issuer were to be denied the benefit of a treaty entered into by The Netherlands and as a consequence payments were made to the Issuer subject to withholding taxes, and the Obligors do not make ""gross-up"" payments that cover the full amount of any such withholding taxes, the amounts available to make payments on, or distributions to, the Noteholders would accordingly be reduced. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Interest Coverage Tests and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be determined by reference to such net receipts. A Collateral Tax Event shall occur if the aggregate amount of any withholding tax on payments in respect of the Collateral Debt Obligations during any",p,
"Due Period is equal to or in excess of 6 per cent. of the aggregate interest, discount or premium payments due on all Collateral Debt Obligations during such Due Period (other than any additional interest arising as a result of the operation of any gross-up provision), following which the Rated Notes may be redeemed (in whole but not in part) at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).",p,
Action 7,p,
"Action 7 is intended to prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status. As noted above, whether the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax may depend on whether the Collateral Manager is regarded as an agent of independent status for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK- Netherlands double tax treaty. The final recommendation for Action 7 would exclude the Collateral Manager from the definition of an independent agent if it acts exclusively, or almost exclusively, on behalf of enterprises which, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, it ""controls"". The draft OECD commentary published as part of the final recommendation gives the following as an example of what is meant by control: ""where a person or enterprise controls an enterprise by virtue of a special arrangement that allows that person to exercise rights that are similar to those that it would hold if it possessed directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interests in the enterprise"". However, it is not clear in what other circumstances ""control"" might exist.",p,
"If the Issuer carries on investment activities as opposed to a trade, the final recommendations for Action 7 are not expected to affect the Issuer. However, if the Issuer were to be trading, and the UK- Netherlands double tax treaty were amended to incorporate the final recommendations of the OECD in relation to Action 7, then the Issuer could be treated as having a taxable permanent establishment in the UK if it is ""controlled"" by the Collateral Manager, and the Collateral Manager acts exclusively or almost exclusively for enterprises that it ""controls"". If UK tax were imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, the amount of tax due would likely be significant on the basis that some or all of the interest which it pays on the Notes may not be deductible. Profits from dealings in the Collateral Debt Obligations could also become taxable. If the UK imposed tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this will constitute a Note Tax Event, which may result in an optional redemption (in whole but not in part) of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).",p,
"On 28 January 2016, the European Commission published a Commission Recommendation encouraging the Member States of the EU to implement and make use of this final recommendation in order to address artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status.",p,
Implementation of the final recommendations,p,
"In February 2015, the OECD approved a mandate (endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors) to develop a multilateral instrument which will implement some or all of those final recommendations that relate to double tax treaties, including those relating to Actions 6 and 7, by 31 December 2016. The multilateral instrument is being developed by an ad hoc Group of countries including the UK and The Netherlands. Nevertheless, it is not yet certain which countries will sign this multilateral instrument, nor whether and to what extent the final recommendations of the OECD will be implemented.",p,
EU Savings Directive,p,
"Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in that other Member State.",p,
"On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above (the “Amending Directive”). EU member states are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand",p,
"the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Amending Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU member state must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.",p,
"For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding if a withholding system is still in operation when they are implemented.",p,
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).,p,
"If a payment were to be made or collected through a state which operates a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor the Principal Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. Pursuant to Condition 8(d) (Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agents), so long as such a jurisdiction exists, the Issuer is required to maintain a paying agent in an EU member state that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, the EU Savings Directive.",p,
Dutch VAT Treatment of the Collateral Management Fees,p,
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Dutch law, the Collateral Management Fees should be exempt from VAT in The Netherlands. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a ""special investment fund"" for the purposes of article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT act.",p,
"This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the ""Directive""), which provides that Member States shall exempt the management of ""special investment funds"" as defined by Member States.",p,
"On 9 December 2015, the ECJ handed down its judgment in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C‑595/13 (the ""Fiscale Eenheid Case"") which concerned whether a Dutch real estate fund qualified as a ""special investment fund"" under the Directive. The Court decided that the power accorded to Member States to define the meaning of ""special investment funds"" must be exercised consistently with the objectives pursued by the Directive and with the principle of ""fiscal neutrality"", and accordingly that the following are ""special investment funds"": (i) funds which constitute undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities within the meaning of the UCITS Directive and (ii) funds which, without being collective investment undertakings within the meaning of that Directive, display features that are sufficiently comparable for them to be in competition with such undertakings - in particular that they are subject to specific State supervision under national law (as opposed to under the UCITS Directive). The Court did not answer the question of whether the fund the subject of its decision constituted a ""special investment fund"", including the question of whether the fund was subject to ""specific State supervision"", leaving this to the national court to determine. The Dutch courts, including the Supreme Court that referred the Fiscale Eenheid Case to the ECJ, have not elaborated on this concept of ""specific state supervision"".",p,
"Accordingly, there is a risk that the Issuer may not qualify as a ""special investment fund"" under the Directive and/or the Dutch VAT act. The Issuer (and other Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles) have the benefit of a tax ruling from the Dutch tax authorities (which pre-dates the Fiscale",p,
"Eenheid Case), confirming that the relevant VAT exemption can be applied for Collateral Management services to Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including the Issuer, once it is registered with the designated tax inspector). There is a risk that following the Fiscale Eenheid Case, this tax ruling may not be applicable. Nevertheless, the Issuer is not presently aware of any indication that, in light of the Fiscale Eenheid Case, the Dutch tax authorities intend to change the scope of the relevant VAT exemption in the Dutch VAT act or change their practice in respect of the application of this exemption in the context of collateralised loan obligation structures, but there is a risk that the Dutch tax authorities may seek to change their position in the future and Dutch VAT may be imposed on the Collateral Management Fees.",p,
FATCA,p,
"FATCA imposes an information reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments from sources within the United States and gross proceeds from the disposition of property which produces certain U.S. source income, (ii) ""foreign passthru payments"" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and",p,
(iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. The Issuer will be classified as a financial institution for these purposes.,p,
"The Issuer will use best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement between the United States and The Netherlands with respect to FATCA (the ""IGA""), and the Dutch legislation and regulations implementing the IGA (including the required registration with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"")). If, however, the Issuer fails to comply with the IGA and becomes subject to withholding under FATCA, it would be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on U.S. source interest payments and, beginning in 2019, proceeds from the sale of U.S. Collateral Debt Obligations and, potentially, on payments and proceeds with respect to non-U.S. Collateral Debt Obligations, which could materially affect the Issuer's ability to make payments on the Notes, and could result in a Collateral Tax Event.",p,
"The Issuer will require (and other intermediaries through which Notes are held are expected to require) each Noteholder to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and its direct or indirect owners (or beneficial owners) or controlling persons in order to enable the Issuer (or an intermediary) to identify and report on certain Noteholders and certain of the Noteholder's direct and indirect U.S. owners or controlling persons to the IRS or the relevant taxing authority. The Issuer (and intermediaries through which such Notes are held) may also be required to withhold on payments to Noteholders that do not provide the required information, or that are ""foreign financial institutions"" that are not compliant with, nor exempt from, FATCA. Although certain exceptions to these disclosure requirements could apply, the failure to provide the required information may give the Issuer (or an intermediary) the right to sell the Noteholder's Notes (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value). See Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA). Moreover, the Issuer is permitted to make any amendments to the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document, and the Trustee shall consent to (without the consent of the Noteholders) such amendment, to enable the Issuer to comply with FATCA. For the purposes of this discussion, the term ""Noteholder"" includes a beneficial owner of Notes.",p,
"If an amount in respect of FATCA were to be deducted or withheld either from amounts due to the Issuer or from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of the Notes, neither the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the Conditions of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected. Furthermore, any requirement to deduct or withhold such withholding tax would not result in the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which the Notes may be subject to early redemption in the manner described in Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event). Prospective investors should refer to the summary under ""Tax Considerations - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"" below.",p,
"Anti-Money Laundering, Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures",p,
"Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the ""Requirements""). Any of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, or the Trustee could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, and the Trustee will comply with Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. Failure to honour any request by the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee to provide requested information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee to comply with any Requirements, related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or informal) may result in, among other things, a forced sale to another investor of such investor’s Notes. In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith.",p,
Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,p,
"The Issuer’s investment activities may subject it to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending against claims against the Issuer by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would be borne by the Issuer. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be bought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.",p,
Fixed Charges,p,
"Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
Centre of Main Interests,p,
"The Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands. As a result there is a rebuttable presumption that its centre of main interests (""COMI"") is in The Netherlands and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings applicable to it would be governed by Dutch law. In the decision by the European Court of Justice (""ECJ"") in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ restated the presumption in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings, that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if ""factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which",p,
"locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect"". As the Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands, has Dutch directors and is registered for tax in The Netherlands, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI is not located in The Netherlands, and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, Dutch insolvency proceedings would not be applicable to the Issuer.",p,
Relating to the Notes,p,
Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,
"Although there is currently a limited market for notes representing collateralised debt obligations similar to the Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes), there is currently no market for the Notes themselves. The Placement Agent may make a market for the Notes, but is not obliged to do so, and any such market making may be discontinued at any time without notice. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See the ""Plan of Distribution"" and ""Transfer Restrictions"" sections of this Prospectus. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,
"In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in w hich CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.",p,
Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,p,
"The market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
"Furthermore, prospective investors should note that, in certain circumstances, optional redemption is subject to the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager, which consent may be withheld in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion. See Conditions 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders), 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders or Collateral Manager) and 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).",p,
The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class,p,
"The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds (A) after the Non-Call Period, on any Business Day at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and subject to the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager or (B) following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event, on any Business Day falling after such occurrence at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders).",p,
"In addition, the Rated Notes may be redeemed in part by entire Class from Refinancing Proceeds at the applicable Redemption Prices, from any Refinancing Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution and subject to the prior written consent or at the written direction of the Collateral Manager. Any such redemption shall be of an entire Class or Classes of Notes subject to a number of conditions. See Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders or Collateral Manager).",p,
"Following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, on any Business Day the Collateral Manager may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds, if the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 20 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. See Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Collateral Manager Clean-up Call).",p,
"As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing), Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part, such Refinancing will only be effective if among other things, Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments received in accordance with the procedures set out in the Trust Deed, and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) save for the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.",p,
"In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class, such Refinancing will only be effective if certain conditions are satisfied, including but not limited to: (i) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption and (ii) the sum of (A) the Refinancing Proceeds and (B) the amount of Interest Proceeds standing to the credit of the Interest Account in excess of the aggregate amount of Interest Proceeds which would be applied in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments prior to paying any amount in respect of the Subordinated Notes on the next Payment Date will be at least sufficient to pay the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption in full and all accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses in connection with the Refinancing in full. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing). The Credit Risk Retention Rules may impair the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing, which may adversely affect the Issuer and the performance of the Notes (see ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence"" above).",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Placement Agent, the Arranger or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer and, at the direction of the Collateral Manager, the Trustee shall amend the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies as necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Subordinated Notes. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,
"The Notes shall also be redeemed on a Business Day in whole but not in part at the written direction of (x) the Controlling Class or (y) the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event. The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Payment Date on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the written direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.",p,
Remedies pursued by the Controlling Class could be adverse to the interests of holders of Notes that are subordinated to the Controlling Class and the Controlling Class will have no obligation to consider any possible effects on such interests.,p,
"In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.",p,
The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the option of the Collateral Manager,p,
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion certifies to the Trustee that it has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and whose acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. Additionally, on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period only, a Special Redemption of the Rated Notes may apply in respect of Interest Proceeds if the Interest Diversion Test is not met. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,
Mandatory Redemption of the Rated Notes,p,
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the holders of the Rated Notes or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, as provided in more detail below.",p,
Mandatory Redemption following breach of the Coverage Tests,p,
"If either of the Class A/B Coverage Tests are not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date (in the case of the Class A/B Par Value Test) or on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date (in the case of the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test), Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A",p,

The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early,p,
"The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if, among other things, any of the following occur:",p,
(a) acceleration of the Notes following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Issuer that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.,p,
The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period,p,
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may still reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations and the Sale Proceeds",p,
"from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set out in the Collateral Management Agreement. See ""Reinvestment of Collateral Debt Obligations - Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period"" below.",p,
Additional Issuances of Notes or the Making of Contributions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and a Note Event of Default,p,
"At any time, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Debt Obligations, and/or (in the case of the proceeds of issuance of additional Subordinated Notes only) towards the Permitted Uses.

"(ii) retain a designated portion of Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be distributed on the Subordinated Notes of a Subordinated Noteholder, to the Issuer (each, a ""Contribution"" and each such Noteholder, a ""Contributor"").",p,
The application of the proceeds of additional Notes as Interest Proceeds or toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or the acceptance of a Contribution could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and could also prevent certain Note Events of Default from occurring and thus potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes.,p,
"The Credit Risk Retention Rules may impair the ability of the Issuer to undertake any additional issuance which may adversely affect the Issuer and the performance of the Notes (See ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence"" above).",p,
Additional Issuances of Notes May Result in the Dilution of Existing Noteholders,p,
"The issuance and sale of additional Notes in accordance with Condition 17 (Additional Issuance) requires that existing Noteholders shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. To the extent that an existing Noteholder determines not to purchase such additional Notes, or purchases only a portion of its entitlement thereof, the proportion of the Notes held by such holder may be diluted following such additional issuance. In addition, the Issuer may, subject to the approval of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution and subject to the approval of the Retention Holder, issue new Notes having substantially the same terms and conditions as the Notes subject to certain conditions including that such new Class(es) will be subordinated to the payment of interest and principal to the most junior Class of Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes). As a result of any such issuance, holders of the Subordinated Notes may be further subordinated.",p,
Purchase and Surrender of Rated Notes; Cancellation,p,
"Contributions accepted and received into the Contributions Account may (at the direction of the related Contributor or, if no such direction is given by the Contributor, at the Collateral Manager’s reasonable discretion) be applied by the Issuer in order to repurchase Rated Notes of any Class through a tender offer, in the open market, or in privately negotiated transaction(s) (in each case, subject to applicable law and in accordance with Condition 7(k) (Purchase)) (any such Rated Notes, ""Repurchased Notes""). Any such Repurchased Notes will be submitted to the Registrar for cancellation and will be promptly cancelled by the Registrar on behalf of the Issuer and may not be issued or resold.",p,
Limited Recourse Obligations,p,
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees,p,
"and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).

Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Placement Agent, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders and",p,

Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be.

Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,p,
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, then the filing or presentation of such a petition could result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such filing being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed.",p,
Amount and Timing of Payments,p,
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes (so long as the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class D Notes (so long as the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes or the C Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class E Notes (so long as the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes are outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class F Notes (so long as the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes or the Class E Notes are outstanding), or to pay scheduled or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments, will not be a Note Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,
"Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited,p,
"The monthly reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, in consultation with and based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,
Future Ratings of the Rated Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. In the event that a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set out for such Rated Note in this Prospectus and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.",p,
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations,p,
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (inc luding but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Notes.",p,
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if either Rating Agency has not yet confirmed its initial ratings of the applicable Rated Notes or, in the case of Moody’s, it has not been deemed to have provided such confirmation, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such",p,
"rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value of liquidity of the Notes.",p,
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken,p,
"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the ""arranger"" (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the ""arranger"" is the Issuer.",p,
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The unsolicited ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any unsolicited rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Such unsolicited ratings could have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,
"The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualify as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation (an ""NRSRO"") for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,p,
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling on or around 7 December 2029 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the issuers of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and the characteristics of such loans, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or",p,
"exchange offers for such Collateral Debt Obligations. Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Debt Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.",p,
"Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain",p,
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Debt Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Debt Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Prospectus or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,
Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,p,
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a 100 per cent. loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Debt Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to any particular Class of Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,
Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,p,
"It is anticipated that the proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes net of certain fees and expenses will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.",p,
Withholding Tax on the Notes,p,
"Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of interest or principal on the Notes, there can be no assurance that the law will not change and the Issuer is entitled to withhold from any payments in respect of the Notes any amount required by law (see Condition 9 (Taxation)). In particular, the Issuer has the right to withhold on all payments made to any beneficial owner of an interest in any of the Notes that fails to provide the Issuer (or its agent) with the Holder FATCA Information or to certain FFIs that fail to enter into a FATCA agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), or are not otherwise FATCA compliant. See further ""FATCA"" above.",p,
"In the event that any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,
"In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction for or on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of (i) the Controlling Class or (ii) the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
Security,p,
"Clearing Systems: Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Debt Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over",p,
(i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Debt Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian on trust for the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian.,p,
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the",p,
"Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.",p,
"Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
"Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",p,
"The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below, however all of the following discussion is subject to the provision in Condition 14(b)(xi) (Retention Holder Veto), that provided no Retention Event has occurred and is continuing, no modification nor any Resolution to approve the modification of the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests, the Reinvestment Criteria or any material changes to them nor the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager (other than a replacement Collateral Manager appointed upon the removal of the Retention Holder or any Affiliate of the Retention Holder) will be effective without the consent in writing of the Retention Holder.",p,

Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution, Extraordinary Resolution or Unanimous Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.",p,
"In the event that a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution (other than a Unanimous Resolution) which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter.",p,
"There are, however, quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution, an Ordinary Resolution or a Unanimous Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable), in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant",p,
"Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of a Unanimous Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing 100 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution.",p,
"The removal of the Collateral Manager following the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (vi) of the definition thereof can only be effected by the Issuer (in its own discretion) or the Trustee, acting upon the direction of (a) the holders of the Controlling Class, acting independently by Extraordinary Resolution or (b) a Majority of each Class of Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and passed by way of Written Resolution (consequently the meeting provisions for resolutions do not apply for the removal right of each Class of Notes). For purposes of this paragraph, ""Majority"")"" means the holders of more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of any Class or Classes.",p,
"In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, other than in the case of a Unanimous Resolution meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.",p,
"Certain decisions, including the removal of the Collateral Manager, instructing the Trustee to accelerate the Notes and instructing the Trustee to sell the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes require authorisation solely by the Noteholders of a Class or Classes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution).",p,
Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.,p,
"Any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person will have no voting rights with respect to any vote (or written direction or consent) in connection with any CM Removal Resolutions and will be deemed not to be Outstanding in connection with any such vote; provided, however, that any Notes held by the Collateral Manager, or a Collateral Manager Related Person will, save as otherwise expressly provided, have voting rights (including in respect of written directions and consents) with respect to all other matters as to which Noteholders are entitled to vote, including, without limitation, any CM Replacement Resolutions or with modifications to its duties pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,
"Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Rated Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights.",p,
"Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.",p,
"Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.",p,
Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders.,p,

It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.",p,

"In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, modifications may also be made and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters which the Issuer or the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee is required (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely without enquiry and without liability) and the Trustee shall consent to such modifications and waivers upon receipt of such certification, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).",p,
Concentrated Ownership of one or more Classes of Notes,p,
"If at any time one or more other affiliated owners (including the Collateral Manager and any Collateral Manager Related Persons) hold a majority of one or more Classes of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of the one or more Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, a majority of the Subordinated Notes may by Ordinary Resolution direct an optional redemption of all of the Notes.",p,
"On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager and certain Collateral Manager Related Persons will purchase a Majority of the Subordinated Notes. Therefore, at any time when the Collateral Manager (or one or more Collateral Manager Related Persons) holds a Majority of the Subordinated Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require the consent of such Class of Notes, without the Collateral Manager and such Collateral Manager Related Persons’ consent. In addition, a Majority of the Subordinated Noteholders may trigger an optional redemption of the Notes after the Non-Call Period. See further ""Certain Conflicts of Interest – Collateral Manager"" below.",p,
Enforcement Rights Following a Note Event of Default,p,
"If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (subject, in either case, to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following a Note Event of Default described in paragraph (vi) or (vii) of the definition thereof shall occur, such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.",p,
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting",p,
"by Extraordinary Resolution (subject, in either case, to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments; (B) otherwise, in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), or",p,
"(iv) of 10(a) (Note Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Note Event of Default; or (C) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes acting independently by way of Extraordinary Resolution may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).",p,
"The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests to certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,
Certain ERISA Considerations,p,
"Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (""ERISA"") or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the ""Code"") or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, ""Plans"") invest in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes, the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered ""prohibited transactions"" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled ""Certain ERISA Considerations"" below.",p,
Forced Transfer,p,
"The initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines at any time that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a ""U.S. Person"") and is not a QIB/QP (any such person, a ""Non-Permitted Holder"") or a Noteholder is a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) demanding that such Noteholder transfer its interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) within 30 days (or 10 days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder) of the date of such notice. If such Noteholder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non Permitted ERISA Holder), (a) upon direction from the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, the Transfer Agent, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and is not a Non-Permitted",p,
"ERISA Holder (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.",p,
"In addition under FATCA, the Issuer (or an authorised agent acting on behalf of the Issuer (and any agent or broker through which a Noteholder purchases its Notes, or any nominee or other entity through which a Noteholder holds its Notes (any such agent, broker, nominee or other entity, an ""Intermediary"") may be required to, among other things, provide certain information about the Noteholders to a taxing authority (see ""FATCA"" above). The Issuer will require each Noteholder to provide the Issuer (or an agent of the Issuer) and the Trustee with the Holder FATCA Information. The Issuer may force the sale of a Noteholder’s Notes in order to achieve FATCA Compliance, including Notes held by a Noteholder that fails to provide the required Holder FATCA Information or if the Issuer otherwise reasonably determines that a Noteholder’s acquisition or holding of an interest in such a Note would cause the Issuer to be unable to achieve FATCA Compliance (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value). For these purposes, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a Noteholder’s interest in its Notes in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to achieve FATCA Compliance. If the Issuer is required to sell the Notes, the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly transact in securities and selling such Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the Noteholder to the beneficial owner by its acceptance of an interest in the Notes agrees to co-operate with the Issuer and the Transfer Agent to effect such transfers. The terms and conditions of any such transfer shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer subject to the transfer restrictions set out in this Prospectus and the Trust Deed, and neither the Issuer nor the Transfer Agent shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.",p,
U.S. Tax Characterisation of the Notes,p,
"The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Rated Note, each holder (and any beneficial owner of an interest in the Rated Notes) will be deemed to have agreed, to treat the Rated Notes as debt of the Issuer and the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer, in each case for United States federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law.",p,
"Upon the issuance of the Notes, Allen & Overy LLP will deliver an opinion generally to the effect that, under current law, assuming compliance with the Transaction Documents, and based on the validity of certain assumptions regarding the Rated Notes and factual representations made by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, and the Class D Notes will, and the Class E Notes should, be characterised as debt of the Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be given in respect of the Class F Notes.",p,
"The determination of whether a Note will or should be treated as debt for United States federal income tax purposes is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the Note is issued. Prospective investors should be aware that the classification of an instrument as debt or equity is highly factual, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise as something other than indebtedness any particular Class or Classes of the Rated Notes. If any of the Rated Notes were treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences might apply. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, see ""Tax Considerations – U.S. Taxation"".",p,
"The Issuer will be a ""Passive Foreign Investment Company,"" and may be a ""Controlled Foreign Corporation,"" for United States Federal Income Tax Purposes",p,
"The Issuer is expected to be treated as a passive foreign investment company (""PFIC"") for United States federal income tax purposes, which means that a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes, and any other Class of Notes treated as equity for United States federal income tax purposes (collectively ""Equity Notes"") may be subject to adverse tax consequences, which may be mitigated if such U.S.",p,
"Holder elects to treat the Issuer as a qualified electing fund and to recognise currently its proportionate share of the Issuer’s income and gain whether or not distributed to such U.S. Holder. In addition, depending on the overall ownership of the Equity Notes and certain other factors, a U.S. Holder of 10 per cent. or more of the Equity Notes may be treated as a United States shareholder in a controlled foreign corporation and required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the ""subpart F income"" of the Issuer whether or not distributed to such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder that makes a qualified electing fund election, or that is required to include subpart F income in the event that the Issuer is treated as a controlled foreign corporation, may recognise income in amounts significantly greater than the payments received from the Issuer. Taxable income may exceed cash payments when, for example, the Issuer uses earnings to repay principal on the Notes or accrues income on the Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the receipt of cash or the Issuer discharges its debt at a discount. A U.S. Holder that makes a qualified electing fund election or that is required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the subpart F income of the Issuer will be required to include in current income its pro rata share of such earnings, income or amounts whether or not the Issuer actually makes any payments to such holder. The Issuer will cause its independent accountants to provide any U.S. Holder of the Subordinated Notes, upon request by such U.S. Holder and at the Issuer's expense, with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Holder would need to make a qualified electing fund election and/or to comply with the controlled foreign corporation rules.",p,
Relating to the Collateral The Portfolio,p,
"The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other",p,
"things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria which each Collateral Debt Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Prospectus, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied as at the Determination Date preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Prospectus does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Debt Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Placement Agent or the Arranger, have made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agents, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Agents, any Hedge Counterparty, the Retention Holder, or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.",p,
Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,
"The Issuer will invest in a portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations consisting at the time of acquisition of predominantly Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Senior Unsecured Obligations, Second Lien Loans, High Yield Bonds, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations, as well as certain other investments, all of which will have greater credit and liquidity",p,
"risk than investment grade sovereign or corporate bonds or loans. The Collateral is subject to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.",p,
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See ""The Portfolio"" section of this Prospectus.",p,
"Due to the fact that the Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations, it is anticipated that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"The offering of the Notes has been structured so that the Notes are assumed to be able to withstand certain assumed losses relating to defaults on the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. See the ""Ratings of the Notes"" section of this Prospectus. There is no assurance that actual losses will not exceed such assumed losses. If any losses exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by such defaults. To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation securing the Notes and the Issuer sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Debt Obligation, it is likely that the proceeds of such sale or disposition will be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon.",p,
"The financial markets periodically experience substantial fluctuations in prices for obligations of the types that may be Collateral Debt Obligations and limited liquidity for such obligations. No assurance can be made that the conditions giving rise to such price fluctuations and limited liquidity will not occur, subsist or become more acute following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the ability of the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Collateral Manager deems advantageous may be impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is either unable to dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices have risen or to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices are on the increase; the Collateral Manager’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets will conversely cause the value of the Portfolio to decline as the value of unsold positions is marked to lower prices. A decrease in the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations would also adversely affect the proceeds of sale that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Debt Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Collateral Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Placement Agent may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor’s participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Collateral Manager or the Placement Agent would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Collateral Manager or the Placement Agent and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"Except for a right to object to certain purchases under the Warehouse Arrangements as described below, the Placement Agent has not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.",p,
Acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date,p,
"On behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations (each, a ""Warehoused Asset"", and collectively, ""Warehoused Assets"") during the period prior to the Issue Date (such period, the ""Warehouse Period"") pursuant to a financing arrangement (the ""Warehouse Arrangements"") between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, one or more Affiliates of the Placement Agent (the ""Citi Parties""), certain other mezzanine investors and one or more Affiliates of the Collateral Manager (such funds and affiliates of the Collateral Manager, together, the ""Warehouse Investors"") with respect to such purchases. The Warehouse Arrangements will be terminated on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Citi Parties and the Warehouse Investors in connection with such arrangements will be repaid by the Issue Date from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Citi Parties and the other Warehouse Investors in respect of the funds provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date.,p,
"Under the Warehouse Arrangements, the Citi Parties indirectly provided and will provide prior to the Issue Date financing to the Issuer to allow its acquisition of the Warehoused Assets ( provided that the Citi Party approves the purchase of any such Warehoused Assets). The approval by any Citi Parties of the purchase of any Warehoused Assets will be in its capacity as the financing party and should not be viewed as a determination by Citi as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether it will satisfy the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer. If the Citi Parties do not approve the purchase of any Warehoused Assets, the Issuer may be restricted from purchasing that asset for a certain period, which may result in the Issuer paying a higher price.",p,
"The Warehouse Investors have, during the Warehouse Period, provided certain of the junior funding to the Issuer. On the Issue Date, such junior funding will be redeemed at par plus the interest accrued on the Warehoused Assets (net of a financing fee due to the Citi Parties and any other expenses and fees due under the Warehouse Arrangements). Certain of the Warehouse Investors may, but are not required to, purchase any Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. If the Issue Date occurs, any losses or gains (realised or unrealised) resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets, will be for the account of the Issuer. If the Issue Date does not occur, the Warehouse Investors and the applicable Citi Parties will bear the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets. The interests of the Citi Parties and the Warehouse Investors in respect of the Warehoused Assets will not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.",p,
"The prices paid for such Collateral Debt Obligations will be the prevailing prices at the time of the execution of such trades and in market circumstances applicable at that time, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Debt Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date.",p,
"An Affiliate of the Placement Agent, in its capacity as senior lender under the Warehouse Arrangements, was involved in the process of acquisition by the Issuer (with the Collateral Manager",p,
"acting on its behalf) of the Warehouse Assets. However, an Affiliate of the Placement Agent's involvement in such process was solely in its capacity as senior lender under the Warehouse Arrangements and should not be viewed as a determination by the Placement Agent or its Affiliate as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether such asset satisfies the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer.",p,
"In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Debt Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Investors on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Debt Obligations from the date such Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Debt Obligations during such period, provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Investors and the applicable Citi Parties. On and following the Issue Date, any losses or gains (realised or unrealised) resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets will be for the account of the Issuer. On and following the Issue Date the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets is for the account of the Issuer (and therefore the Noteholders), including in respect of the period prior to the Issue Date. The interests of the participants in the Warehouse Arrangements in respect of the Warehoused Assets may not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.",p,
"The financing provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date by applying part of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes. Certain costs and expenses related to the Warehouse Arrangements, including the interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the Warehouse Arrangements and payment of certain fees and reimbursement of certain expenses to such lender and any agents appointed in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, will therefore be borne by the Issuer as such amounts will be paid by application of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may (from time to time) enter into forward purchase arrangements with the Issuer under which the Issuer shall commit to purchase and settle Collateral Debt Obligations from the Collateral Manager for the same purchase price as the Collateral Manager has committed to purchase that Collateral Debt Obligation from the relevant third party (which shall be no earlier than 15 Business Days after the date of such commitment to purchase). See ""The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements"".",p,
"The price and availability of a Collateral Debt Obligation may be adversely affected by a number of market factors, including price volatility of Collateral Debt Obligations and the availability of investments suitable for the Issuer, each of which could hamper the ability of the Issuer to acquire an initial portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligation that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and the Effective Date Determination Requirements prior to the Effective Date. Delays in reaching the Target Par Amount may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Rated Notes and the distributions on the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes, provided that if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such rating confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 30 Business Days following the Effective Date the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure; (ii) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan; or (iii) where the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation",p,
"from Moody’s is not received, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred. If an Effective Date Rating Event occurs, the Issuer may, in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, apply Interest Proceeds (and, to the extent Interest Proceeds are not sufficient, Principal Proceeds) to pay principal of the Rated Notes pursuant to the Note Payment Sequence until the Rated Notes are paid in full or until such ratings are confirmed. There is no assurance that the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and the Effective Date Determination Requirements.",p,
The prices of the Rated Notes will be fixed on the pricing date. The actual purchase prices of the Warehoused Assets purchased after the pricing date were not known at that time and may be higher or lower than the purchase prices expected on the pricing date. The returns on Subordinated Notes will vary depending upon the actual purchase prices of the Warehoused Assets and Collateral Debt Obligation purchased on or after the Issue Date and may be materially different from the expected returns calculated based upon market prices prevailing at the pricing date.,p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set out herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Debt Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be ""undervalued"" levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
"In circumstances where the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations, events occurring between the date of such commitment and the settlement date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of such Collateral Debt Obligations during such intervening period and will be risks borne by the Issuer (and, indirectly, the Noteholders).",p,
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Debt Obligation is entered into and any failure by such obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action; provided that Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations shall be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date (in each case, as determined by the Collateral Manager).",p,
Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period,p,
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Debt Obligations in order to satisfy each of the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied as of the Determination Date falling prior to the second Payment Date), the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Target Par Amount requirement as at the Effective Date. See ""The Portfolio"" section of this Prospectus. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Asset Swap Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Asset Swap Transactions. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Debt Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Debt Obligations are",p,
"not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or enter into required Asset Swap Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of other Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
"Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Debt Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
Characteristics and Risks Relating to the Portfolio,p,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of (among others) Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Senior Unsecured Obligations, High Yield Bonds, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations, lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each of the Classes of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Debt Obligations which are ""Defaulted Obligations"".",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Debt Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of",p,
"a default with respect to any of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield bond, senior secured bond and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Debt Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments.",p,
"Characteristics of Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, not less than 90 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance must consist of Senior Secured Loans and Senior Secured Bonds in aggregate (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Collateral Balance of the Senior Secured Loans and Senior Secured Bonds and the balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions or capital structures in respect of an Obligor, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the borrower in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Senior Unsecured Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Loans or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Senior Secured Loans and Senior Secured Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Senior Unsecured Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Secured Loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Senior Secured Bonds typically bear interest at a fixed rate. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at paragraph ""Interest Rate Risk"" below. Additionally, Senior Secured Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Senior Secured Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Senior Secured Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interes t to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders",p,
"may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,
"The majority of Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
"Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans or bonds. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Loan, Senior Secured Bond or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate or bondholders normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Loan, Senior Secured Bond or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans or bonds and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Loan, Senior Secured Bond or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan or bond may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to any given Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk in the event that such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Senior Secured Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than",p,
"there is for Senior Loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Senior Loan.",p,
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Loan and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Loans. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,
Prepayment Risk,p,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Senior Secured Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or make-whole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
Defaults and Recoveries,p,
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Mezzanine Obligations and Second Lien Loans and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Loan, Senior Secured Bond, Mezzanine Obligation or Second Lien Loan often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Loan, Senior Secured Bond, Mezzanine Obligation or Second Lien Loan will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Mezzanine Obligations and Second Lien Loans may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions , the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been",p,
"accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Loans and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, an extension of the maturity and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,
"In some European jurisdictions, obligors or lenders may seek a ""scheme of arrangement"". In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. Recoveries on Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See ""Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination"" below.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Debt Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. The definition of Cov-Lite Loan does not include any loan that, although it has no maintenance or incurrence covenant, contains a cross-default provision to another loan of the underlying obligor that requires the underlying obligor to comply with such financial covenants or a maintenance covenant (each, an ""excluded loan""). If the application of such covenants is subject to certain conditions (for example, in the case of a revolver, the condition that such revolver has been drawn), and those conditions have not been satisfied, such covenants will afford no protection to the Issuer. As a result of the ownership of such excluded loans and Cov-Lite Loans, the Issuer’s exposure to losses may be increased, which could result in an adverse impact on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or",p,
recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.,p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.",p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See ""Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination"" below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.",p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a pledge of collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second",p,
Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens;,p,
(ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and,p,
"(iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the",p,
"borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors;",p,
"(b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) debtor-in-possession financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Debt Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Debt Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Debt Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligation.",p,
Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Debt Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
"Participations, Novations and Assignments",p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Debt Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub-participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment or participation is referred to herein as a ""Selling Institution"". Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as ""Assignments"". Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub-participation are referred to herein as ""Participations"".",p,
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such",p,
"Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the c ollateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest of the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Participations expose the Issuer to the credit risk of the relevant Selling Institution - see further ""Counterparty Risk"" below.",p,
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests impose limits on the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Aggregate Collateral Balance.,p,
Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not",p,
"require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Debt Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
Corporate Rescue Loans,p,
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any).",p,
Bridge Loans,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.",p,
Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time, or out of a Collateral Manager Advance or as a Permitted Use of certain other proceeds. Such Balance shall include sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payments rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
"To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion from time to time pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, an ""Collateral Manager Advance"") to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of Interest Proceeds and Principal",p,
"Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payments or, at any time, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager, out of amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account.",p,
"The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be partially dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. If sufficient amounts are not so available, the Collateral Manager may, subject to the limits on the number of Collateral Manager Advances, at its discretion, fund the payment of any shortfall by way of a Collateral Manager Advance. However, the Collateral Manager is under no obligation to make any Collateral Manager Advance. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests.",p,
Counterparty Risk,p,
"Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments.",p,
"If the counterparty was a regulated entity, it could become subject to a special resolution regime, if implemented in its jurisdiction of incorporation, applicable in circumstances in which the competent supervisory authorities consider its failure has become likely and if certain other conditions are satisfied (depending on the relevant power granted to the supervisory authorities), for example to protect and enhance the stability of the financial system in which the counterparty is incorporated. A special resolution regime may consist of stabilisation options, including bail-in, and special insolvency procedures. In general terms, the purpose of the stabilisation options is to address the situation where all or part of a business of the counterparty has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties, giving rise to wider public interest concerns. It is therefore possible that one of the stabilisation options could be exercised prior to the point at which any insolvency proceedings with respect to the counterparty could be initiated. Bail-in means that certain claims of creditors of the counterparty could be reduced to the extent required, in proportion to the losses of that counterparty, written down to zero and/or converted to equity. The exact scope of the stabilisation options depends on the implementation of the special resolution regime in the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated.",p,
"Each counterparty is further required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"In the event that a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable remedy period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. In the event that the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and which is acceptable to the Trustee within 30 days of such withdrawal or downgrade.",p,
"Investors should be aware that pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as defined in the Conditions), the Issuer is required to pay to the Account Bank all costs and expenses properly incurred by the Account Bank in relation to the accounts of the Issuer held with the Account Ban k arising directly from the imposition of negative deposit interest rates by the European Central Bank or any other applicable rate setting authority. Such costs and expenses will be payable as an Administrative Expense, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, and may negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders.",p,
Concentration Risk,p,
"The Issuer will invest in Collateral Debt Obligations consisting primarily of Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Senior Unsecured Obligations, High Yield Bonds, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations. Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See ""The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests"" section of this Prospectus. Although the resulting diversification of Collateral may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.",p,
Credit Risk,p,
Risks applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,
Interest Rate Risk,p,
Certain Classes of Notes will bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Debt Obligations (in particular Senior Secured Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis.,p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue",p,
"or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. The historical performance of EURIBOR should not be taken as an indication of the performance of EURIBOR whilst the Rated Notes remain Outstanding. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such Interest Rate Hedge Transaction is in a form in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has previously received approval from each Rating Agency) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in ""EMIR"" and ""Commodity Pool Regulation"" above. In particular, the Issuer may enter into the Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions on or around the Issue Date in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in EURIBOR or LIBOR-based payments of interest payable by the Issuer under the Rated Notes as further described in ""Hedging Arrangements"". However, the Issuer will depend on each Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure.",p,
"Collateral Debt Obligations may pay interest on a semi-annual basis. In addition, some Collateral Debt Obligations permit the Obligor to reset the applicable interest period from quarterly to semi-annual (and vice versa). Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a quarterly basis at all times except following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event (as described below), in which case they shall be calculated on a semi-annual basis. If a significant number of Collateral Debt Obligations pay interest on a semi-annual basis there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mismatch, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest less than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (""Interest Smoothing"") (at all times other than following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event when interest on the Notes will switch to semi-annual pay). In addition, to mitigate reset risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) sufficient Collateral Debt Obligations reset from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of ""Frequency Switch Event"". There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate such timing and reset risks.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes, that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes or that the Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions (if any) would be sufficient to mitigate any interest rate risk.",p,
"Furthermore, the Issuer is exposed to interest rate risk by virtue of the Accounts. As interest rate levels fluctuate over time, the Issuer may be entitled to a lower rate of interest on some or all Accounts or, in some circumstances, may be required to pay a negative interest rate to the Account Bank (which would be payable as Administrative Expenses subject to the Priorities of Payment). Any such lower or negative rate of interest will reduce the funds available for the Issuer to make distributions in respect of the Notes.",p,
Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limits set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. Although the Issuer intends to hedge against certain currency exposures pursuant to the Asset Swap Transactions it is not required that all Non-Euro Obligations must be Asset Swap Obligations and some may be Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate for currencies in which Non-Euro Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Collateral",p,
Debt Obligations being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders or may result in a decrease in value of the Collateral for the purposes of sale hereof upon enforcement of the security over it.,p,
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under the Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.,p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events increase the risk of a mismatch between the Non-Euro Obligations and the Notes. This may cause losses. The Collateral Manager may be limited at the time of reinvestment in its choice of Collateral Debt Obligations because of the cost of the foreign exchange hedging and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management Agreement with respect to exercising such hedging. In addition, it may not be economically advantageous or feasible for the Issuer to exercise its hedging arrangements and such hedging arrangements may not be sufficient to protect the Issuer from fluctuations in Euro exchange rates.",p,
"The Issuer will depend upon the Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,
International Investing,p,
"The Portfolio will consist of obligations of, or securities issued by, obligors organised under the laws of a variety of different countries. Investing in certain countries may involve greater risks than investing in other countries, including: (i) less publicly available information; (ii) varying levels of governmental regulation and supervision; (iii) the difficulty of enforcing legal rights in a foreign jurisdiction and uncertainties as to the status, interpretation and application of laws; and (iv) foreign exchange controls. Moreover accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.",p,
"Different markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, which could create delays in the purchase and sale of Portfolio. Delays in settlement could result in periods when assets of the Issuer are uninvested or invested in short term investments with low yields. The inability to sell Collateral Debt Obligations due to settlement problems could result in losses due to subsequent declines in the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,
"To the extent the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Debt Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Debt Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such",p,
"Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, which will further reduce the yield on the Adjusted Aggregate Collateral Balance. Any decrease in the yield on the Adjusted Aggregate Collateral Balance will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Debt Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Debt Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Debt Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Debt Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Debt Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
Ratings on Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Moody’s Caa Obligation or Fitch CCC Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation. The Collateral Management Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Moody’s Rating and the Fitch Rating. In most instances, the Moody’s Rating and the Fitch Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Debt Obligation. In most cases, the Fitch Rating and Moody’s Rating in respect of a Collateral Debt Obligation will be based on a confidential credit estimate determined",p,
"separately by Fitch and Moody’s. Such confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or Affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different Rating Agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. In certain cases, the Moody’s Rating and/or the Fitch Rating of a Collateral Debt Obligation may be derived from a rating assigned to such Collateral Debt Obligation by a different rating agency. Such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Debt Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Debt Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Debt Obligation in question. Please see ""Ratings of the Notes"" and ""The Portfolio"".",p,
"In addition to the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by the Rating Agencies, the Issuer will be utilising ratings assigned by rating agencies to Obligors of individual Collateral Debt Obligations.

Please see ""The Portfolio"" and ""Ratings of the Notes"".",p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Debt Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set out in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Moody’s Caa Obligations and Fitch CCC Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,
Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a",p,
"number of continental European jurisdictions operate ""debtor friendly"" insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Debt Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor. If an Obligor is a regulated financial institution, the Issuer may be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant Obligor - see further ""Counterparty Risk"" above.",p,
"The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Mezzanine Obligations, Corporate Rescue Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.",p,
Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed ""lender liability""). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called ""equitable subordination"". Because of the nature of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Debt Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Debt Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
Loan Repricing,p,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and",p,
"increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on the Collateral Debt Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,
"Downward movements in interest rates could also adversely affect the performance of non-investment grade bonds with call or redemption features. Such a call or redemption feature would permit the issuer of such debt securities to repurchase such securities from the Issuer. If a call were exercised by such an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Issuer likely would have to replace such called non-investment Collateral Debt Obligations with lower yielding Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,p,
"At the time when the Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that interest payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not be subject to withholding tax (other than U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed on fees or under FATCA) imposed by any jurisdiction under the current market practice unless: (i) such withholding tax can be eliminated in full by application being made under an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise; (ii) the Obligor is required to make ""gross-up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis (and in the case of Participations, neither payments to the Selling Institution nor payments to the Issuer will be subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction unless the Obligor is required to make ""gross-up"" payments that compensate the Issuer directly or indirectly in full for any such withholding on an after-tax basis); or (iii) if the Obligor is not required to make ""gross-up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis, the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, based on payments received by the Issuer on an after-tax basis, is maintained or improved before and after such purchase. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof or otherwise, the payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding tax rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) any domestic exemption or procedural formality under the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the relevant Obligor or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Debt Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation without withholding or deduction of tax. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest, principal and other amounts payable in respect of the Notes of each Class. The occurrence of any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction owing to a change in law may result in the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event pursuant to which the Notes may be subject to early redemption at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders in the manner described in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).",p,
Collateral Manager,p,
"The Collateral Manager is given authority in the Collateral Management Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management Agreement.

Investors should note that the concept of ""gross negligence"" may be interpreted by an English court as implying a significantly lower required standard of care on the part of the Collateral Manager than ordinary negligence under English law. As a result, the Collateral Manager may have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Collateral Management Agreement where it would otherwise have been liable for failing to reach the required standard of care if an ordinary negligence standard of care standard were applied under the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,

Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) are expected to be approximately €401,700,000. Such proceeds will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date.

The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Debt Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.",p,

"The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to United States federal income tax on its net income. In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement, including the Investment Guidelines, and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for United States federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, to comply with the Investment Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Investment Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Investment Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for United States federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for United States federal income tax purposes. If it is determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, possibly on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to United States federal income tax on its net income.",p,
"The Issuer does not generally anticipate being subject to material withholding taxes with respect to interest on Collateral Debt Obligations. There can be no assurance, however, that this or other income derived by the Issuer will not become subject to withholding or gross income taxes as a result of changes in law, contrary conclusions by the IRS, or other causes. In particular, the Issuer may be subject to withholding or gross income taxes in respect of commitment fees, facility fees, and other similar fees imposed by the United States or other countries. Withholding or gross income taxes could be applied retroactively to fees or other income previously received by the Issuer. To the extent that withholding or gross income taxes are imposed and not paid through withholding, the Issuer may be directly liable to the relevant taxing authority to pay such taxes.",p,
Regulatory Risk Related to Lending,p,
"In many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities ""in"" certain jurisdictions whether conducted via the granting of loans, purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, ""Lending Activities"") is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws. In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Lending Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"As such, Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to these local law requirements. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or",p,
"domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
Valuation Information; Limited Information,p,
"None of the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee, or Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest,p,
"The Placement Agent and its Affiliates and the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,
Collateral Manager,p,
"Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may exist from the overall investment activities of the Collateral Manager, or any Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or any directors, officers or employees of the Collateral Manager or their respective Affiliates and/or any third party account over which the Collateral Manager or any Affiliate of the Collateral Manager has discretionary management (collectively, ""Collateral Manager Related Persons"").",p,
"On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager will be reimbursed by the Issuer for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes and the negotiation and documentation of the Transaction Documents, including the Collateral Management Agreement (including legal fees and expenses).",p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting in its capacity as the Retention Holder, will subscribe for on the Issue Date and, hold, from the Issue Date, on an ongoing basis, Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount Outstanding as of the Issue Date equal to or not less than 5 per cent. of (i) on any Business Day prior to the Effective Date, the greater of the Aggregate Collateral Balance and the Maximum Par Amount and (ii) otherwise, the greater of the Maximum Par Amount and the highest Aggregate Collateral Balance recorded from and including the Effective Date to the Maturity Date. See ""The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements"" below. The Retention Holder, the Collateral Manager and/or other Collateral Manager Related Persons may also purchase additional Subordinated Notes and/or Rated Notes on or after the Issue Date.",p,
"In addition to the Retention Notes, the Collateral Manager and certain Collateral Manager Related Persons will purchase additional Subordinated Notes (with the result that on the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager and such Collateral Manager Related Persons are together expected to hold a Majority of the Subordinated Notes) and certain of the Rated Notes. See ""Concentrated Ownership of one or more Classes of Notes"" above.",p,
"Any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person will have no voting rights with respect to any vote (or written direction or consent) in connection with any CM Removal Resolutions and will be deemed not to be Outstanding in connection with any such vote; provided, however, that any Notes held by the Collateral Manager, or a Collateral Manager Related Person will, save as otherwise expressly provided, have voting rights (including in respect of written directions and consents) with respect to all other matters as to which Noteholders are entitled to vote, including, without limitation, any CM Replacement Resolutions or with modifications to its duties pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,
"Subject to the foregoing, there will be no restriction on the ability of the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Persons to purchase Notes (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) or to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled (except that Notes held by the Collateral Manager, certain of its Affiliates and their respective employees shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights under certain circumstances as described in the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement). Further, the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person will be under no obligation to hold any Notes so purchased (other than in order to maintain compliance with the Retention Requirements) and may sell such Notes at any time. Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person may constitute a blocking and/or a controlling stake in Notes of a given Class (including for the avoidance of doubt, the Controlling Class. The interests of the Collateral Manager and Collateral Manager Related Persons and other investors in the Notes may not be aligned and may create conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person on the one hand and other investors in the Notes on the other hand. Such conflicts could arise in a number of different circumstances including, without limitation, in relation to decisions to amend and/or waive (or decisions to block amendments or waivers to) provisions of the Transaction Documents relating to the Notes or in relation to the early redemption of the Notes. Moreover, such ownership of Notes by Collateral Manager Related Persons, the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee and the opportunity to earn an Incentive Collateral Management Fee could provide an incentive for the Collateral Manager to seek to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer at a lower price or to otherwise make riskier investments than would otherwise be the case.",p,
"Collateral Manager Related Persons also currently serve as and expect to serve as collateral manager or investment advisor for, act as a general partner to, or invest in or are affiliated with other entities which invest in, underwrite or originate high yield bonds and loans, including those organised to issue collateral debt obligations similar to those issued by the Issuer. In addition, Collateral Manager Related Persons may form or have a financial or operational interest in the management of one or more hedge funds or similar alternative investment vehicles which may be permitted to allocate a portion of their portfolios to high yield debt, bank loans and long dated, illiquid, restricted or other similar securities and investment opportunities (including, without limitation, private equity investments, mezzanine investments and distressed investments). Thus, the Collateral Manager and Collateral Manager Related Persons may, at the same or approximately the same time, buy or sell for such clients debt obligations the Collateral Manager also buys or sells for the Issuer. Collateral Manager Related Persons may invest in securities or obligations that would be appropriate as Collateral Debt Obligations and may be buyers or sellers of credit protection that reference Collateral Debt Obligations owned by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and Collateral Manager Related Persons may also purchase debt obligations for other clients that are senior to, or have interests adverse to, those the Collateral Manager buys or sells for the Issuer. As a result, Collateral Manager Related Persons may possess information relating to issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations which is not known to the individuals at the Collateral Manager responsible for monitoring the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"Alternatively, the Collateral Manager may buy or sell for its clients a debt obligation that it does not buy or sell for the Issuer, even though the debt obligation is eligible to be bought or sold by the Issuer, if the Collateral Manager believes the circumstances warrant. The Collateral Manager might have an incentive to favour such other clients over the Issuer because the Collateral Manager may have a larger direct or indirect investment in such other clients, have business relationships with those clients",p,
"or persons associated with them, or be paid a higher level of fees by those clients. Neither the Collateral Manager nor any of its Affiliates is under any obligation to offer investment opportunities of which they become aware to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before engaging in any investments or to account to the Issuer (or share with the Issuer) with respect to any such transaction or any benefit received by them from any such transaction. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may make an investment on behalf of any account that any of them manage or advise without offering the investment opportunity to or making any investment on behalf of the Issuer. Affirmative obligations may exist or may arise in the future, whereby Collateral Manager Related Persons are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that such Persons manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager offering those investments to the Issuer. Under the Collateral Management Agreement, unless the Collateral Manager determines that a purchase or sale is appropriate, the Collateral Manager may refrain from causing the Issuer to purchase or sell securities issued by persons about which any Collateral Manager Related Persons has information which the Collateral Manager deems confidential or non-public or otherwise might prohibit it from advising as to the trading of such securities in accordance with applicable law.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to buy or sell one or more Collateral Debt Obligations, in one or more transactions, with the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates and/or other Collateral Manager Related Persons. In addition, the Collateral Manager, acting as principal for its own account or for the account of an Affiliate, may effect other transactions between itself or an Affiliate and the Issuer. Such transactions will present a conflict between the interests of the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates and/or their other clients, and the interests of the Issuer.",p,
"No provision in the Collateral Management Agreement prevents the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates and/or other Collateral Manager Related Persons from rendering services of any kind to any person or entity, including the issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Debt Obligations and their respective Affiliates, the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and the Hedge Counterparties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates may, among other things: (a) serve as directors, partners, officers, employees, agents, nominees or signatories for any issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Debt Obligations; (b) receive fees for services rendered to the issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Debt Obligations or any Affiliate thereof; (c) be retained to provide services unrelated to the Collateral Management Agreement to the Issuer and be paid therefor; (d) be a secured or unsecured creditor of, or hold an equity interest in, any issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Debt Obligations; (e) sell or terminate any Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments to, or purchase or enter into any Collateral Debt Obligations from, the Issuer while acting in the capacity of principal or agent; and (f) serve as a member of any ""creditors’ board"" with respect to any obligation included in the Collateral Debt Obligations which has become or may become a Defaulted Obligation. Services of this kind may lead to conflicts of interest with the Collateral Manager, and may lead individual officers or employees of the Collateral Manager to act in a manner adverse to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager may from time to time rely on the brokerage, trading, settlement and other capital markets capabilities of its Affiliates in performing its duties under the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,
Clients of the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates may act as counterparty with respect to Hedge Transactions and Participations or as party to or in connection with the investment of any funds in Eligible Investments.,p,
"There is no limitation or restriction on the Collateral Manager, or any of its respective Affiliates or other Collateral Manager Related Persons with regard to acting as Collateral Manager or originator (or in a similar role) to other parties or persons. This and other future activities of the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest. See ""The Collateral Manager"" section of this Prospectus.",p,
"The Collateral Manager does not owe fiduciary duties to the Issuer, the Noteholders or any other Secured Party.",p,
"Although the professional staff of the Collateral Manager will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager deems appropriate to perform its duties in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement, the staff of the Collateral Manager may have conflicts in allocating its time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s other accounts. The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, aggregate orders for its accounts under management. Depending on market conditions, the aggregation of orders may result in a higher or lower average price paid or received by a client.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may have discussions with investors from time to time. The views expressed in such discussions may influence the composition of the portfolio, and there can be no assurance that",p,
"(i) a holder would agree with any views expressed by other investors in such discussions, (ii) the",p,
"views expressed by some investors will not be more influential than those of others, or (iii) modifications made to the portfolio as a result of such discussions will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"The Collateral Manager will act as the ""originator"" for the purposes of the Retention Requirements and will be required to satisfy the Originator Requirement (which will be satisfied if, on the Issue Date, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations that have been acquired by the Issuer from the Collateral Manager, divided by the Target Par Amount, is greater than or equal to 5 per cent.). See ""The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements"" below. The Collateral Manager, acting in its capacity as the Retention Holder, will subscribe for and hold, on an ongoing basis, Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount Outstanding equal to not less than five per cent. of",p,
"(i) on any Business Day prior to the Effective Date, the greater of the Aggregate Collateral Balance and the Maximum Par Amount and (ii) otherwise, the greater of the Maximum Par Amount and the highest Aggregate Collateral Balance recorded from and including the Effective Date to the Maturity Date.",p,
"The Retention Holder may from time to time enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the Retention Requirements and grant the lender that provides such financing a security interest in the Retention Notes. In exercising its rights pursuant to any such financing arrangements following a default by the Retention Holder, the lender would not be required to have regard to the Retention Requirements and any sale or appropriation of the Retention Notes following a default by the Retention Holder may therefore cause the transaction described in this Prospectus to be noncompliant with the Retention Requirements. See ""The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements"".",p,
Rating Agencies,p,
"Moody’s and Fitch have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where, as is the case with the ratings of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings), the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services.",p,
Conflicts of interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates,p,
"Each of the Placement Agent and its Affiliates (the ""Citi Parties"") will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction and in other roles described below.",p,
"The Citi Parties have been involved (together with the Collateral Manager) in the formulation of the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Priorities of Payments and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement. These may be influenced by discussions that the Placement Agent may have or have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting",p,
"modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes. An Affiliate of the Placement Agent was also a Warehouse Investor under the Warehouse Arrangements. See further ""Acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date"" above.",p,
"The Placement Agent will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Placement Agent in respect of those Notes. The Placement Agent may elect in its sole discretion to rebate a portion of its fees in respect of the Notes to certain investors, including the Retention Holder. The Placement Agent may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Placement Agent expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,
"The Citi Parties may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market. The Citi Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The financial services that the Citi Parties may provide also include financing and, as such, the Citi Parties may have and/or may provide financing to the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person. Such financing may include retention financing arrangements of the type described in ""Regulatory Initiatives – Retention Financing"" above. When exercising its rights in connection with any such retention financing, the relevant Citi Party could seek to enforce its security over all or some of the Retention Notes and take possession or sell such Retention Notes to a third party. In addition, the Citi Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of any such financings. The Citi Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Debt Obligations. In addition, the Citi Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Debt Obligations. Each of the Citi Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party including, without limitation, in deciding whether to enforce its security granted in connection with any financing. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors Affiliated with the Citi Parties or in which one or more Citi Parties hold an equity participation or other interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Citi Parties' own investments in such Obligors.",p,
"From time to time the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Debt Obligations through or to the Citi Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Citi Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participation interests and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Citi Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.",p,
"The Citi Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Prospectus except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Citi Parties and employees or customers of the Citi Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to or referencing the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations",p,
"and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Citi Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Citi Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Citi Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,
"By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.",p,
Investment Company Act,p,
"The Issuer has not registered with the SEC as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exemption under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for investment companies (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by ""qualified purchasers"" (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.",p,
"If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.",p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer at any time determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Holder, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder by the Issuer or a Transfer Agent (and notice by such Transfer Agent to the Issuer if the Transfer Agent makes the determination), send notice to such Non-Permitted Holder demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder transfer its interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such Non-Permitted Holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30 day period, (a) upon direction from the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, a Transfer Agent, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to such Transfer Agent and the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and",p,

RATINGS OF THE NOTES,h2,
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Notes (except for the Subordinated Notes) be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes: Aaa(sf) from Moody’s and AAAsf from Fitch; the Class B Notes: Aa2(sf) from Moody’s and AAsf from Fitch; the Class C Notes: A2(sf) from Moody’s and Asf from Fitch; the Class D Notes: Baa2(sf) from Moody’s and BBBsf from Fitch; the Class E Notes: Ba2(sf) from Moody’ and BBsf from Fitch and the Class F Notes: B2(sf) from Moody’s and B-sf from Fitch. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.,p,
"The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes address the ultimate payment of principal and interes t. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.",p,
Moody’s Ratings,p,
"The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s are based upon its assessment of the probability that the Collateral Debt Obligations will provide sufficient funds to pay each such Class of Notes, based largely upon Moody’s statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with various ratings, the asset and interest coverage required for such Class of Rated Notes (which in the case of a Class of Rated Notes is achieved through the subordination of each Class of Notes ranking below such Class of Rated Notes) and the diversification requirements that the Collateral Debt Obligations are required to satisfy.",p,
Moody’s ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date. The structure allows for timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of princ ipal with respect to the Class A Notes by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.,p,
"Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Debt Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, obligor and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Debt Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.",p,
"In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that they deem relevant.",p,
Fitch Ratings,p,
The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Fitch are based upon Fitch’s statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with similar characteristics to the Collateral Debt Obligations and the various eligibility requirements that the Collateral Debt Obligations are required to satisfy.,p,
"Fitch analyses the likelihood that each Collateral Debt Obligation will default, based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Fitch then determines the level of credit protection necessary based on a specific percentile of the portfolio default distribution determined by the Fitch ""Portfolio Credit Model"" which takes into account the correlation between assets in the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. The results of a statistical analysis are incorporated into a cash flow model built to mimic the structure of the transaction. In this regard,",p,
"the results of several default scenarios, in conjunction with various qualitative tests (e.g. analysis of the strength of the Collateral Manager), are used to determine the credit enhancement required to support a particular rating.",p,
Fitch’s ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.,p,
"There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by Fitch in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not defer from those assumed by Fitch.",p,
"In addition to those quantitative tests, Fitch ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Fitch deems relevant.",p,

THE PORTFOLIO,h2,
The following description of the Portfolio consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.,p,
Terms used and not otherwise defined herein or in this Prospectus as specifically referenced herein shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.,p,
Introduction,p,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer, in each case to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.",p,
Acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of primarily Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Senior Unsecured Obligations, Corporate Rescue Loans, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans, High Yield Bonds, Bridge Loans during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least €273,000,000 which is approximately 68 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (as defined in the Conditions). The proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date; and (b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes will be deposited in the Expense Reserve Account and the Unused Proceeds Account on the Issue Date. The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall use all reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account and amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and available for such purpose, in each case during the Initial Investment Period. During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 31 May 2017 (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next following Business Day), subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.",p,
"On or after the Effective Date, the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Ac count will be transferred to the Principal Account and/or the Interest Account, in each case, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer), provided that as at such date: (i) the Issuer has acquired or entered into binding commitments to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (after taking into account any transfer in (ii)); and (ii) no more than 1 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the Effective Date may be transferred to the Interest Account.",p,
"Within 10 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the ""Effective Date Report"") containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire",p,
"Collateral Debt Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its Fitch Collateral Value) and within 30 Business Days following the Effective Date the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide to the Trustee an accountants’ certificate confirming the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at such date and the computations and results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests) by reference to such Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,
"The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes, provided that if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such rating confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s. If the Effective Date Moody’ s Condition is not satisfied within 30 Business Days following the Effective Date the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure; (ii) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan; (iii) where the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s is not received, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each subsequent Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payments, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.",p,
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or any other intended action which will cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.,p,

(c) so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding:,p,
(i) the Weighted Average Life Test; and,p,
"(ii) the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, each as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement.",p,
The Principal Balance of Defaulted Obligations shall be excluded for the purposes of calculating the,p,
Collateral Quality Tests.,p,
Moody’s Test Matrix,h3,
"Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set out in the matrix to be set out in the Collateral Management Agreement (the ""Moody’s Test Matrix"") shall be applicable for purposes of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. For any given case:",p,
"(a) the applicable column for performing the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in which the elected case is set out;",p,
(b) the applicable row and column for performing the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the row and column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable) in which the elected case is set out; and,p,
"(c) the applicable row for performing the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows, as applicable) in which the elected test is set out.",p,
"On the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will be required to elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter, on ten Business Days’ notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and Moody’s, the Collateral Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test applicable to the case to which the Collateral Manager desires to change are satisfied (and, in relation to the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, taking into account the case that the Collateral Manager has elected to apply under the Fitch Test Matrix) or, in the case of any tests that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Collateral Manager be obliged to elect to have a different case apply.",p,
Fitch Tests Matrices,h3,
"Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set out in the matrix to be set out in the Collateral Management Agreement (the ""Fitch Test Matrices"") shall be applicable for purposes of the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test, the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test and the Maximum Obligor Concentration Test. For any given case:",p,
"(a) the applicable column for performing the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in the applicable Fitch Test Matrix selected by the Collateral Manager;",p,

The Fitch Tests Matrices may be amended and/or supplemented and/or replaced by the Collateral Manager subject to Rating Agency Confirmation from Fitch.",p,
The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,h3,
"The ""Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test"" will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set out in the column entitled ""Minimum Diversity Score"" in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable ""row/column"" combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).",p,
"The ""Diversity Score"" is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Debt Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows:",p,
"(a) an ""Average Principal Balance"" is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of Obligors represented;",p,
"(b) an ""Obligor Principal Balance"" is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Debt Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Debt Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations or distributed to the Holders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Debt Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;",p,
"(c) an ""Equivalent Unit Score"" is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and",p,
(ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;,p,
"(d) an ""Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score "" is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and",p,
"(e) an ""Industry Diversity Score"" is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the ""Diversity Score Table"") for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.",p,
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.,p,

"The Collateral Management Agreement also permits the Collateral Manager, in its discretion, to engage on behalf of the Issuer in (a) cross transactions between the Issuer and another client of the Collateral Manager provided it has reasonable grounds to believe that any such cross transaction is justified from the perspective of the Issuer and is consistent with the Issuer’s investment policies and",p,

The Collateral Manager’s current procedures regarding principal transac tions require that, prior to effecting any principal transaction, it notify the board of directors of the Issuer to such principal transaction. Those procedures require that the Collateral Manager disclose to the board of directors of the Issuer (i) the capacity in which it is acting; (ii) that the transaction is a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of the Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment for which market quotations are readily available or other methods exist to determine an arm’s length price; (iii) that the transaction is effected at the independent current market price determined as follows (x) if the transaction is an interest in a bank loan traded in a dealer market, at the next price reported at the close of such market by an independent pricing service so long as the reliability of the prices provided by the pricing service have been found to be indicative of market value; and (y) for all other transactions, the average of at least two current independent bids determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry or, for assets in respect of which no such bids exist, on terms no worse to the Issuer than those agreed to by other investors unrelated to the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates; (iv) that the transaction is consistent with the investment policies of the Issuer; and (v) that no brokerage commission or fee (except for customary transfer fees or other remuneration) will be paid in connection with the transaction.",p,

HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS
The following section consists of a summary of certain provisions which, pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, are required to be contained in each Hedge Agreement and Hedge Transaction. Such summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of each Hedge Agreement and Hedge Transaction. The terms of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction may differ from the description provided herein, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof or without Rating Agency Confirmation if such Hedge Transaction constitutes a Form Approved Asset Swap or Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge.
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the hedging arrangements to be entered into by the Issuer on or about the Issue Date and thereafter. The following is a summary only and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive description of the detailed provisions of such documents (copies of which are available from the registered office of the Issuer). Any Hedge Agreement may include additional or different terms to those described below.
Hedge Agreements
Subject to (i) such arrangements at the time they are entered into satisfying the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria, or (ii) the receipt by the Collateral Manager of legal advice from a reputable legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not require any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or their respective directors, officers or employees to register with the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor pursuant to the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into hedging transactions as described below and documented under a 1992 (Multicurrency - Cross Border) or 2002 Master Agreement or such other form published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA"").",h3,
Form Approved Hedge Agreements,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, shall provide at least two (2) Business Days’ prior written notification to each Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes each time it enters into a Hedge Transaction in the form of a Form Approved Asset Swap or Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge.",p,
"Form Approved Asset Swap means an Asset Swap Transaction and the related Asset Swap Agreement, the documentation for and structure of which conforms (save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the name and financial aspects of the related Collateral Debt Obligation, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and any other consequential amendments in respect thereof required to reflect the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation) to a form approved by the Rating Agencies from time to time provided that any form approved by the Rating Agencies prior to the Issue Date shall, unless otherwise notified to the Issuer by a Rating Agency, constitute a Form Approved Asset Swap.",h3,
"Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge  means an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction and the related Interest Rate Hedge Agreement, the documentation for and structure of which conforms (save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the applicable floating rate index, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and any other consequential amendments in respect thereof required to reflect the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation) to a form approved by the Rating Agencies from time to time provided that any form approved by the Rating Agencies prior to the Issue Date shall, unless otherwise notified to the Issuer by a Rating Agency, constitute a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge.",p,
Currency Hedging Arrangements,p,
Asset Swap Agreements,p,
"The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase Non Euro Obligations provided that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, for any Non Euro Obligation, enters into an Asset Swap Transaction with an Asset Swap Counterparty (i) if such Non Euro Obligation is denominated in a Qualifying Unhedged Obligation Currency and acquired in the Primary Market, within 90 days of the settlement date of acquisition thereof and otherwise (ii) not later than the settlement date thereof, pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made in connection with funding the Issuer’s acquisition of the related Non Euro Obligation and the f inal and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.",h2,
"Transactions entered into under an Asset Swap Agreement are documented in confirmations to such Asset Swap Agreement. Each transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to an Asset Swap Agreement (each an ""Asset Swap Transaction""). An Asset Swap Transaction, if entered into, will be:",p,
"(a) used to hedge the currency (and if applicable, interest rate) mismatch between the Notes and any Non Euro Obligations;",p,
"(b) in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to delivery of prior written notice to the Rating Agencies in respect thereof; and",p,
"(c) other than in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof.",p,
"Further, each Asset Swap Counterparty will be required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement (taking into account any guarantor thereof) and have the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivative transactions with Dutch residents.",p,
"Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or around the date of such sale in accordance with its terms, resulting in either (i) the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Asset Swap Obligation from the Issuer (which shall be funded outside the Priorities of Payments from the Non Euro Hedge Account) and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the definition thereof) to the Issuer or (ii) the Issuer retaining the proceeds of sale of the Asset Swap Obligation (which shall be converted into Euro and paid into the Principal Account in accordance with the Conditions) net of any payments due to or from the Asset Swap Counterparty in connection with the termination of the Asset Swap Transaction in such circumstances (which the Issuer shall pay to the Asset Swap Counterparty on the date such payment is due in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement).",p,
"Furthermore, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Asset Swap Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, in which case any Asset Swap Termination Payment would be paid in accordance with the Post Acceleration Priority of Payments (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be returned to an Asset Swap Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payments in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement).",p,
"If, following the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes, the Asset Swap Counterparty, elects not to early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, the Asset Swap Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the relevant Asset Swap Obligation, resulting in the payments referred to in the preceding paragraph being made. An Asset Swap Transaction may also terminate in accordance with its terms upon repayment in full of the related Asset Swap Obligation and related final exchange under such Asset Swap Transaction.",p,
Replacement Asset Swap Transactions,p,
"In the event that any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty is the ""Defaulting Party"" or sole ""Affected Party"" (each as defined in the applicable Asset Swap Agreement) the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction within 30 days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies, among other things, the applicable Rating Requirement and which has the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivative transactions with Dutch residents.",h3,
"In the event of termination of an Asset Swap Transaction in the circumstances referred to above, any Asset Swap Termination Receipt will be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and shall be applied towards the costs of entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, together with, where necessary, Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that are available for such purpose on any Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payments, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation, save:",p,
"(a) where the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, determines not to replace such Asset Swap Transaction and Rating Agency Confirmation is received in respect of such determination; or",p,
"(b) where termination of the Asset Swap Transaction occurs on a Redemption Date pursuant to Conditions 7(a) (Final Redemption), 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (other than in connection with a Refinancing), 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or 10(a) (Note Events of Default); or",p,
"(c) to the extent that such Asset Swap Termination Receipt is not required for application towards any Asset Swap Replacement Payment,",p,
in which event such Asset Swap Termination Receipt shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.,p,
"In the event that the Issuer receives any Asset Swap Replacement Receipt upon entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, such amount shall be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and applied directly by the Collateral Administrator acting on the instructions of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in payment of any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable upon termination of the Asset Swap Transaction being so replaced. To the extent not fully paid out of Asset Swap Replacement Receipts, any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable by the Issuer shall be paid to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty on the next Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. To the extent not required for making any such Asset Swap Termination Payment, such Asset Swap Replacement Receipts shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.",p,
"Subject to sub-paragraph (a) above, in the event that a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction cannot be entered into in such circumstances, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell the applicable Non-Euro Obligation, pay the proceeds thereof to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty, to the extent required pursuant to the terms of such Asset Swap Transaction and/or to the extent not so required, shall direct the Collateral Administrator to convert all of such proceeds into Euro at the Applicable Exchange Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account. In the event that such proceeds are insufficient to pay any Asset Swap Termination Payments in full, such amount, including any Defaulted Hedge Termination Payment, shall be paid out of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds on the next following Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements,p,
Interest Rate Hedge Agreements,p,
"The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into any additional Interest Rate Hedge Transactions from time to time in order to hedge any interest rate mismatch between the Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes) and the Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof and provided that the Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and has the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.",h3,
Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreements,p,
"In the event that an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the ""Defaulting Party"" or sole ""Affected Party"" (each such term as defined in the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Agreement), the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within 30 days of termination thereof with an Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty which satisfies the applicable Ratings Requirement and has the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.",p,
Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria,p,
"The Collateral Manager shall only cause the Issuer to enter into a Hedge Agreement that (i) at the time such Hedge Agreement is entered into, satisfy the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) in respect of which, the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or their respective directors, officers or employees to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"If a responsible representative of the Collateral Manager with knowledge of the Portfolio has actual knowledge of any change in law or regulation, or interpretation thereof, that would lead him or her to reasonably question the viability of the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria mentioned above, the Collateral Manager shall cause the Issuer to seek written legal advice in respect of such Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria. If the Collateral Manager cannot obtain such advice it shall not cause the Issuer to enter into any further Hedge Agreements unless in respect of any such further Hedge Agreement it obtains written legal advice of reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or their respective directors, officers or employees to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"Notwithstanding anything in the Collateral Management Agreement or the Trust Deed to the contrary, the Collateral Manager may unilaterally elect to modify the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria without the consent of any other party so long as it causes the Issuer to obtain an opinion from reputable legal counsel that Hedge Agreements entered into in compliance with such modified Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria will not cause the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or their respective directors, officers or employees to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, if, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Manager, entry into a Hedge Agreement would require registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO, the Issuer will not be permitted to enter into such Hedge Agreement unless such registration is made by the Collateral Manager with respect to, and at the expense of, the Issuer.",p,
Interest Rate Cap Transactions,p,
"On or around the Issue Date, the Issuer may enter into the Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. The Issuer will have no payment obligations in respect of any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions other than the payment of a premium in respect of each such transaction to the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty upon entry into such transactions.",p,
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall exercise any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction on any Business Day when EURIBOR is greater than the strike price set out in the applicable Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) shall not sell or transfer any Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction other than in circumstances where all of the Rated Notes have been redeemed or Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained from each Rating Agency in respect of any such sale or transfer.,h3,
Standard Terms of the Hedge Agreements,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is agreed by the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty and subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof.",h3,
Gross up,p,
"Under each Hedge Agreement the Issuer will not be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Under each Hedge Agreement the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments (excluding, in some cases, any withholding or deduction required pursuant to FATCA). Any such event may however result in a ""Tax Event"" which is a ""Termination Event"" for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. In the event of the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement), each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant ""Affected Party"" (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours, in the case of the Hedge Counterparty, to arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax.",h3,
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition,p,
The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payments) (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be returned to a Hedge Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payments in accordance with the relevant Hedge Agreement). The Issuer will have the benefit of limited recourse and non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).,p,
Termination Provisions,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the occurrence of a number of events (which may include without limitation):",p,
"(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;",p,
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account the applicable grace period;,p,
"(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or perform its obligations under, the applicable Hedge Agreement;",p,
"(d) the principal due in respect of the Notes is declared to be due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and, in some cases, the Trustee has started to sell all or part of the Collateral as a consequence thereof;",p,
(e) the Notes are redeemed in whole prior to the Maturity Date (otherwise than as a result of a Note Event of Default thereunder);,p,
"(f) representations related to certain regulatory matters prove to be incorrect when made, including, without limitation, if the Issuer becomes subject to AIFMD, or if the Issuer or the Collateral Manager is required to register as a ""commodity pool operator"" and such party does not so register pursuant to the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended and certain representations relating to EMIR;",h3,
(g) other regulatory changes occur which have a material adverse effect on a Hedge Counterparty; and,p,
(h) material changes are made to the Transaction Documents without the consent of a Hedge Counterparty which could have a material adverse effect on the Hedge Counterparty.,h3,
A termination of a Hedge Agreement does not constitute a Note Event of Default under the Notes.,p,
Asset Swap Agreements may also contain provisions which allow an Asset Swap Transaction to terminate upon the occurrence of certain credit events or restructuring events related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Debt Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation (as such term is defined in the Conditions). In such instances the related Asset Swap Transaction would terminate and the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) may need to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation unless a new Asset Swap Transaction can be entered into.,h3,
Rating Downgrade Requirements,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies at the time of entry into such Hedge Agreement for the type of derivative transaction described in this Prospectus in the event of the downgrade of the Hedge Counterparty (or, as relevant, its guarantor). Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty downgraded below certain minimum levels consistent with the ratings of the Notes must post collateral; or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity (or, as relevant, its guarantor) meeting the applicable Rating Requirement; or procure that an eligible guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement; or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.",p,
Transfer and Modification,p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Asset Swap or a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge (as applicable) following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the Dutch regulatory capacity as a matter of Dutch law to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.",p,
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.,p,
Governing Law,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder in each case, including any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.",p,
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data,p,
"The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time enter into agreements (each a ""Reporting Delegation Agreement"") in a form approved by the Rating Agencies for the delegation of certain derivative transaction reporting obligations to one or more Hedge Counterparties or third parties (each, in such capacity, a ""Reporting Delegate"").",p,
TAX CONSIDERATIONS,p,
General,p,
Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.,h3,
"Potential purchasers who are in any doubt about their tax position on purchase, ownership, transfer or exercise of any Note should consult their own tax advisers. In particular, no representation is made as to the manner in which payments under the Notes would be characterised by any relevant taxing authority. Potential investors should be aware that the relevant fiscal rules of their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, and that this summary is not exhaustive. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice or a guarantee to any potential investor of the tax consequences of investing in the Notes.",p,
Netherlands Taxation,h3,
"The comments below are of a general nature based on taxation law and practice in The Netherlands as at the date of this Prospectus and are subject to any changes therein, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later date and implement with or without retroactive effect. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and does not purport to describe all possible tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder of Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as holders that are subject to taxation in Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba or trusts or similar arrangements) may be subject to special rules. The following is a general description of certain tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax consideration relating to the Notes and so should be treated with appropriate caution. In particular, it does not take into consideration any tax implications that may arise on a substitution of the Issuer. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding and/or selling Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.",p,
"Investors should note that with respect to paragraph (b) below, the summary does not describe The Netherlands tax consequences for holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest or deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet Inkomstenbenbelasting 2001). Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together with his/her partner (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5 per cent, or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of that company or of 5 per cent, or more of the company’s annual profits and/or 5 per cent or more of the company’s liquidation proceeds.

U.S. Taxation of the Issuer,p,
The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes and this summary assumes that no election will be made for the Issuer to be treated otherwise.,p,
"The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to United States federal income tax on its net income. In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement, including the Investment Guidelines, and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for United States federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the Investment Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Investment Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Investment Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for United States federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the",p,
"Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for United States federal income tax purposes.

The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to United States federal income tax on its net income. Although the Issuer does not intend to be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to its net income, income derived by the Issuer may be subject to withholding or gross income taxes imposed by the United States or other countries. In this regard and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer may generally only acquire a particular Collateral Debt Obligation if, at the time of commitment to purchase, either the interest payments thereon are not subject to withholding tax or the issuer of the Collateral Debt Obligation is required to make ""gross-up"" payments. The Issuer may, however, be subject to withholding or gross income taxes in respect of FATCA (as discussed in more detail below), commitment fees and other similar fees in respect of Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations, as well as with respect to amendment, waiver, consent and extension fees, and such withholding or gross income taxes may not be grossed up.",p,

Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of the Rated Notes,p,

Such opinion will assume compliance with the transaction documents and the validity of certain assumptions and representations regarding the Notes. No opinion will be given with respect to the Class F Notes. The Issuer will treat all Classes of the Rated Notes as debt for United States federal income tax purposes, and this summary assumes such treatment. By acquiring an interest in a Rated Note, the holder (and any beneficial owner of an interest in such Rated Note) will be deemed to have agreed to treat such Rated Notes as debt for United States federal income tax purposes. Prospective investors should note, however, that the classification of an instrument as debt or equity is highly factual, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend, and that a court will not ultimately hold, that one or more Classes of Notes, particularly the more junior Classes of Notes, are equity.",p,
"If the IRS were to challenge the treatment of the Rated Notes and such challenge succeeded, the affected Notes would be treated as equity interests and the United States federal income tax consequences of investing in those Notes would be the same as those described below with respect to investments in the Subordinated Notes.",p,

Except as discussed under ""—Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes"" below, the balance of this discussion assumes that the Rated Notes of all Classes will be characterised as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
Taxation of Interest Income,p,
A U.S. holder of a Rated Note that uses the cash method of accounting must include in income the,p,
"U.S. dollar value of euro interest paid when received. Euro interest received is translated at the U.S. dollar spot rate of euro on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. holder therefore generally will not have foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of a euro interest payment (with certain exceptions discussed below), but may have foreign currency gain or loss upon disposing of the Euro received.",p,
"A U.S. holder of a Rated Note that uses the accrual method of accounting, or any U.S. holder that is otherwise required to accrue stated interest before receipt, including in respect of original issue discount (""OID"") as discussed below, will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of euro interest accrued during the accrual period. A U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest using either of two methods, in either case regardless of whether the payments are in fact converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest is translated at the average euro rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). A U.S. holder of a Rated Note that uses this first method will therefore recognise foreign currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest paid to the extent that the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate on the date the interest is received differs from the rate at which the interest income was accrued. Under the second method, the U.S. holder can elect to accrue interest at the Euro spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the partial period within the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five business days of the receipt of such interest, the spot rate on the date of receipt. An election to accrue interest at the spot rate generally will apply to all foreign currency denominated debt instruments held by the U.S. holder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a U.S. holder may have additional foreign currency gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the euro received.",p,
"For U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID is the excess of the ""stated redemption price at maturity"" of a debt instrument over its ""issue price"", if that excess equals or exceeds ¼ of 1 per cent. of the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity or weighted average maturity in the case of instalment obligations (the ""OID de minimis amount""). The ""stated redemption price at maturity"" of a debt instrument such as the Rated Notes is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Rated Note other than ""qualified stated interest"" payments. The ""issue price"" of a Rated Note generally is the first offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt instrument is sold (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons acting as underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The term ""qualified stated interest"" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain conditions discussed below, at a variable rate.",p,
"Prospective U.S. holders should note that to the extent that interest payments on the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (together the ""Deferrable Notes"") are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes. Consequently, such interest is not unconditionally payable in cash or property at least annually and will not be treated as ""qualified stated interest"". Therefore, all of the stated interest payments on each",p,
"of the Deferrable Notes, will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity of such Notes, and as a result the Deferrable Notes will be treated as issued with OID.",p,
"It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID, such as the provisions of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code (debt instruments that may be accelerated by reason of the prepayment of other debt obligations securing such debt instruments) are applicable to the Rated Notes that are treated as issued with OID. Special tax rules principally relating to the accrual of OID, market discount, and bond premium apply to debt instruments described in Section 1272(a)(6). Further, those debt instruments may not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as part of an integrated transaction with a related hedge under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-6. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effects of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code.",p,
"If a U.S. holder holds a Rated Note with OID (an ""OID Note"") such U.S. holder may be required to include OID in income before receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. holder's accounting method for tax purposes. The amount of the OID includible in income is the sum of the daily accruals of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which such U.S. holder held the OID Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the OID Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between: (a) the product of the ""adjusted issue price"" of the OID Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period); and (b) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The ""adjusted issue price"" of an OID Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the OID Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments the U.S. holder received on the OID Note that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, the U.S. holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.",p,
"Each class of Rated Notes will be ""variable rate debt instruments"" if such class of Rated Notes (a) has an issue price that does not exceed the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes by more than an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 0.015 multiplied by the product of such total non-contingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity of such class of Rated Notes; and (ii) 15 per cent. of the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes; (b) provides for stated interest (compounded or paid at least annually) at the current value of one or more qualified floating rates, including the EURIBOR rate, on such class of Rated Notes; and (c) does not provide for any principal payments that are contingent. The Rated Notes will qualify as variable rate debt instruments, provided the issue price is not more than 115,000 Euro per 100,000 Euro principal amount. Interest payments on certain ""variable rate debt instruments"" may be considered qualified stated interest.",p,
"If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument will be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. Thus, if any class of the Rated Notes does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, a U.S. holder would be required to report income in respect of such Notes in accordance with U.S. Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments, which generally require a U.S. holder to accrue interest on a constant yield basis based on a projected payment schedule determined by the Issuer. The contingent payment debt instrument rules are complex and investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the potential taxation of the Notes under the contingent payment debt instrument rules.",p,
"Because the OID rules are complex, each U.S. holder of an OID Note should consult with its own tax advisor regarding the acquisition, ownership, disposition and retirement of such Note.",p,
"Interest on the Rated Notes received by a U.S. holder (or OID accrued) generally will be treated as foreign source ""passive income"" for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes, or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, ""general category income"".",p,
"Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the federal income tax treatment of any Contribution, including the likelihood that such Contribution will be treated as an equity interest in the Issuer.",p,
"Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Repayment of the Rated Notes",p,
"Unless a non-recognition provision applies, a U.S. holder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale, exchange, repayment or other disposition of a Rated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised plus the fair market value of any property received on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such Rated Note.",p,
"The amount realised on the sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note generally is determined by translating the euro proceeds into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note is disposed of. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in a Rated Note generally will be the cost of the Rated Note to the U.S. holder, determined by translating the euro purchase price into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note was purchased, and increased by the amount of any OID accrued and reduced by any payments other than payments of qualified stated interest of such Note. If, however, the Rated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder or electing accrual basis U.S. holder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date. An election by an accrual basis U.S. holder to apply the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will be subject to the rules regarding currency translation elections described above, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.",p,
"Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of a Rated Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Rated Note, determined at the spot rate on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Rated Note, and the",p,

U.S. dollar value at which the interest was previously accrued.,p,
"Foreign currency gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note is recognised only to the extent of total gain or loss on the transaction and generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency gain or loss on a Rated Note generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. holder, preferential rates may apply to any capital gain if such U.S. holder's holding period for such Rated Notes exceeds one year.",p,
Exchange of Foreign Currencies,p,
"A U.S. holder will have a tax basis in euro received as payment of stated interest, OID or principal, or on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Rated Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt of the euros. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange or other disposition of such euro generally will be ordinary income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit purposes. A U.S. holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.",p,
Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes,p,
"It is possible that the IRS may contend that any Class of Rated Notes should be treated in whole or in part as equity interests in the Issuer. Such a recharacterisation might result in material adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders. If U.S. holders of one or more Classes of the Rated Notes were treated as owning equity interests in the Issuer, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to those U.S. holders would be as described under ""—Tax Treatment of U.S. holders of the Subordinated Notes"".",p,
Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes,p,

If U.S. holders of the Subordinated Notes were treated as owning debt of the Issuer, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to those U.S. holders would be as described under ""U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of the Rated Notes "". The balance of this discussion assumes that the Subordinated Notes will properly be characterised as equity in the Issuer. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
Amounts contributed to the Issuer as a Contribution may be treated as equity in the Issuer and could affect the allocation of income to all of the Subordinated Notes under the QEF and CFC rules discussed below. Prospective holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the federal income tax treatment of a Contribution (including the likelihood that such Contribution will be treated as an equity interest in the Issuer).,p,
Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company,p,
"A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a ""passive foreign investment company"" or ""PFIC"" for United States federal income tax purposes if 75 per cent. or more of its gross income (including the pro rata share of the gross income of any subsidiary corporation in which the corporation is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) in a taxable year is passive income. Alternatively, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC if at least 50 per cent. of its assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based on fair market value (including the pro rata share of the assets of any subsidiary corporation in which the corporation is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value), are held for the production of, or produce, passive income.",p,
"Based on the assets that the Issuer expects to hold and the income anticipated thereon, it is highly likely that the Issuer will be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the following discussion assumes that the Issuer will be a PFIC throughout the term of the Subordinated Notes and U.S. holders of Subordinated Notes should assume that they will be subject to the United States federal income tax consequences described below that result from owning stock in a PFIC (subject to the discussion below under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"").",p,
"Unless a U.S. holder elects to treat the Issuer as a ""qualified electing fund"" (as described in the next paragraph), upon certain excess distributions (generally, a U.S. holder’s ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than 125 per cent. of the average annual distribution received by such U.S. holder in the shorter of the three preceding years or the U.S. holder’s holding period) by the Issuer and upon a disposition of the Subordinated Notes at a gain, the U.S. holder will be liable to pay tax at the highest tax rate on ordinary income in effect for each period to which the income is allocated, as if such distributions and gain had been recognised ratably over the U.S. holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes. An interest charge is also applied to the deferred tax amount resulting from the deemed ratable distribution or gain recognition.",p,
"Assuming the discussion below under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"" does not apply, if a U.S. holder of the Subordinated Notes elects to treat the Issuer as a ""qualified electing fund"" or ""QEF,"" excess distributions and gain will not be taxed as if recognised ratably over the U.S. holder’s holding period and there will be no interest charge applicable to deferred tax. Instead, a U.S. holder that makes a QEF election is required for each taxable year to include in income the U.S. holder’s pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of the QEF as ordinary income (which will not be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction) and a pro rata share of the net capital gain of the QEF as capital gain, regardless of whether such earnings or gain have in fact been distributed. In this regard, prospective U.S. holders of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is possible that a significant amount of the Issuer’s income, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will not be distributed on a current basis for a number of potential reasons, including the retirement of all or a portion of certain Classes of Notes. Thus, U.S. holders of Subordinated Notes that make a QEF election may owe tax on a significant amount of ""phantom"" income. In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. holder must receive from the Issuer certain information (""QEF Information""). The Issuer intends to supply U.S. holders with the information needed for such U.S. holders to comply with the requirements of the QEF election.",p,
"In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute all of its earnings in a taxable year, the electing",p,

"As a result of the nature of the investments that the Issuer intends to hold, the Issuer may hold investments treated as equity of non-U.S. corporations that are PFICs.

Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation,p,
"Depending on the degree of ownership of the Subordinated Notes and other equity interests in the Issuer by U.S. holders and whether the Subordinated Notes are treated as voting securities, the Issuer may constitute a ""controlled foreign corporation"" or ""CFC"". In general, a foreign corporation will constitute a CFC, if more than 50 per cent. of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned, directly, indirectly or constructively, by ""U.S. 10 per cent.

Shareholder,"" for this purpose, is any U.S. person that owns or is deemed to own 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power of all classes of shares of a corporation.

Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, ""subpart F income"" includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, predominantly all of its income would be subpart F income. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion below assumes that the Issuer is not a CFC. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding these special rules.",p,
"If the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, for the period during which a U.S. holder of Subordinated Notes is a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer, such U.S. holder generally would be taxable on its pro rata share of the subpart F income and investments in U.S. property of the Issuer under the rules described in the preceding paragraph and not under the PFIC rules previously described. A U.S. holder that is a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer subject to the CFC rules for only a portion of the time during which it holds Subordinated Notes should consult its own tax advisor regarding the interaction of the PFIC and CFC rules.",p,
Distributions on the Subordinated Notes,p,
"Except to the extent that distributions are attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules or a QEF election is made, some or all of any distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes may constitute excess distributions, taxable as previously described. Distributions of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer which are not excess distributions and which have not been previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules or QEF rules will be taxed as dividends when received. Distributions in excess of previously taxed amounts and any remaining current and/or accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer will be treated first as a non-taxable reduction to the",p,
U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes to the extent thereof and then as capital gain. Dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowable to corporations.,p,
"Dividends on the Subordinated Notes received by a U.S. holder generally will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. For this purpose, dividends on the Subordinated Notes should generally constitute ""passive category income,"" or in the case of certain",p,
"U.S. holders, ""general category income.""",p,
It is not expected that dividends received on the Subordinated Notes will be eligible for taxation at the lower rates applicable to long-term capital gains that are available on certain dividends to non- corporate U.S. holders of shares of U.S. corporations and certain non-U.S. corporations.,p,
"Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of the Subordinated Notes",p,
"In general, a U.S. holder of a Subordinated Note will recognise U.S. source gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of the Subordinated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Subordinated Note. Initially, the tax basis of a U.S. holder should equal the amount paid for a Subordinated Note. Such basis will be increased by amounts taxable to such U.S. holder by virtue of the QEF or CFC rules, if applicable, and decreased by actual distributions from the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a non-taxable return of capital.",p,
"Unless a QEF election is in effect for the U.S. holder’s entire holding period, it is highly likely that any gain realised on the sale or exchange of a Subordinated Note will be treated as an excess distribution and taxed as ordinary income under the special tax rules described above, assuming that the PFIC rules apply and not the CFC rules. If a QEF election is in effect, any gain or loss recognised generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Subordinated Note has been held for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. holders may be entitled to reduced tax rates in respect of long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.",p,
"Subject to a special limitation for individual U.S. holders that have held the Subordinated Notes for more than one year, if the Issuer were treated as a CFC and a U.S. holder were treated as a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder therein, then any gain realised by such holder upon the disposition of Subordinated Notes would be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the Issuer has accumulated earnings and profits attributable to the Subordinated Notes while it was a CFC and the holder held the Subordinated Notes. In this respect, earnings and profits would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules.",p,
Reporting Requirements,p,
"A U.S. holder that transfers property (including cash) to the Issuer in exchange for Subordinated Notes may be required to file an IRS Form 926 or similar form with the IRS. In the event a U.S. holder fails to file any required form, it could be subject to a penalty equal to 10 per cent. of the fair market value of the Subordinated Notes purchased by such U.S. holder (generally up to a maximum of U.S.$100,000).",p,
"A U.S. holder that is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes may be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471, and provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes.",p,
"U.S. holders may be required to file IRS Form 8886 in respect of the Notes if such investors file U.S. federal income tax returns or U.S. federal information returns and recognise losses in excess of a specified threshold. Such filing will also generally be required by a U.S. holder of the Subordinated Notes if the Issuer participates in certain types of transactions that are treated as ""reportable transactions,"" such as a transaction in which its loss exceeds a specified threshold, and either (x) such",p,
"U.S. holder owns 10 per cent. or more of the aggregate amount of the Subordinated Notes and makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer or (y) the Issuer is treated as a CFC and such U.S. holder is a ""U.S. Shareholder"" (as defined above) of the Issuer.",p,
"Certain U.S. holders that hold certain foreign financial assets must file IRS Form 8938 if the total value of those assets exceeds the applicable threshold amounts. In addition, certain non-resident aliens may be required to file IRS Form 8938, notwithstanding the availability of any special treatment under an income tax treaty. In general, such form is not required with respect to assets held through a U.S. payer, such as a U.S. financial institution and U.S. branches of non-U.S. banks, and certain non-U.S. branches or subsidiaries of U.S. financial institutions.",p,
Failure to file applicable IRS Forms may subject U.S. holders to significant penalties and generally will extend the statute of limitations for all or a portion of a taxpayer’s related income tax return until at least three years after the date on which the form is filed. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligations with respect to their ownership or disposition of the Notes in light of their particular circumstances.,p,
Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders of Notes,p,
"Subject to the discussion below under ""Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax,"" payments, including interest, OID and any amounts treated as dividends, on a Note to a non-U.S. holder and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note by a non-U.S. holder, will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax, unless (a) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such non-U.S. holder in the United States; or (b) in the case of United States federal income tax imposed on gain, such non-U.S. holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds a Note as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.",p,
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax,p,
"The amount of interest (including OID) and principal paid or accrued on the Notes, and the proceeds from the sale of a Note, in each case, paid within the United States or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman to a U.S. person (other than a corporation or other exempt recipient) will be reported to the IRS and may be subject, to ""backup withholding tax"" if the U.S. person: (a) fails to furnish its social security or other taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after the request therefor; (b) furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (c) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report interest or dividends; or (d) fails, under certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding tax for failure to report interest and dividend payments.",p,
Non-U.S. persons may be required to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax.,p,
"Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a holder’s United States federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",p,
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA),p,
"FATCA imposes a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial institution (a ""foreign financial institution"", or ""FFI"" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a ""Participating FFI"" by entering into an agreement with the IRS to provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a ""United States account"" of the relevant FFI (a ""Recalcitrant Noteholder""). The Issuer may be classified as an FFI.",p,
"The new withholding regime is in effect for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to ""foreign passthru payments"" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January 2019. This withholding would potentially apply to payments in respect of (i) any Notes characterised as debt for",p,
"U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued after the ""grandfathering date"", which the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified after the grandfathering date and (ii) any Notes characterised as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, whenever issued.",p,
"The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have entered into intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an ""IGA""). Pursuant to FATCA and the ""Model 1"" and ""Model 2"" IGAs released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a ""Reporting FI"" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in an IGA jurisdiction generally would not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being ""FATCA Withholding"") from payments it makes. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS.",p,
"The United States and The Netherlands have entered into an agreement (the ""US-Netherlands IGA"") based largely on the Model 1 IGA. The Issuer expects to be treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the US-Netherlands IGA and does not expect to be subject to FATCA Withholding on payments it receives. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI and that such withholding will not be imposed against the Issuer. If the Issuer does not become a Participating FFI, Reporting FI, or is not treated as exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to FATCA Withholding on payments received from U.S. sources and Participating",p,
FFIs. Any such withholding imposed on the Issuer may reduce the amounts available to the Issuer to make payments on the Notes.,p,
"Provided that the Issuer is treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the US-Netherlands IGA, the Issuer would not anticipate being obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the future not be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer and any financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) a Noteholder is a Recalcitrant Noteholder.",p,
"Whether as a Reporting FI or Participating FFI, the Issuer expects to require (and that an intermediary will require) each Noteholder to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and its owners (or beneficial owners) in order to enable the Issuer (or an intermediary) to identify and report on certain Noteholders and certain of the Noteholder's direct and indirect U.S. beneficial owners to the IRS or the Netherlands tax authorities. Further, the Noteholder will be required to permit the Issuer to share such information with the relevant taxing authority. Although certain exceptions to these disclosure requirements could apply, each Noteholder should assume that if it fails to provide the required information or otherwise prevents the Issuer from achieving FATCA Compliance, the Issuer (or an intermediary) may be compelled to force the sale of the Noteholder's Notes (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value).",p,
"Whilst the Notes are held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any paying agent and the common depositary, given that each of the entities in the payment chain between the Issuer and the participants in the clearing systems is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates that Retention Notes will be issued in definitive, certificated form and the possibility that the Notes may be issued in definitive certificated form or may go into definitive certificated form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. Definitive Notes other than Retention Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.",p,
"FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form.",p,
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes. THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE HOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE HOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.,p,
EU Savings Directive,p,
"Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in that other Member State.",p,
"On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above (the “Amending Directive”). EU member states are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand",p,
"the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Amending Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU member state must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.",p,
"For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding if a withholding system is still in operation when they are implemented.",p,
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).,p,
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,p,
"ERISA imposes certain requirements on ""employee benefit plans"" subject thereto including entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, ""ERISA Plans""), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification and investments being made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.",p,
"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and so-called ""Keogh"" plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, ""Plans"") and certain persons (referred to as ""parties in interest"" under ERISA or ""disqualified persons"" under the Code (collectively, ""Parties in Interest"") and each a ""Party in Interest"")) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.",p,
"Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under Federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.",p,
"Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, the ""Plan Asset Regulation""), if a Plan invests in an ""equity interest"" of an entity that is neither a ""publicly offered security"" nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an ""operating company,"" as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a ""Controlling Person""), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the ""25 per cent. Limitation"") A ""Benefit Plan Investor"" means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.",p,
"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an ""equity interest"" as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may be considered ""equity interests"" for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will be required or deemed to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor and Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under the ""Transfer Restrictions"" section of this Prospectus. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined in accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA, the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). No transfers of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes to a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person will be permitted after the Issue Date. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.",p,
"It is possible that an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.",p,
"Each of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes, may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,
"It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.

"See ""Risk Factors—Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—U.S. Risk Retention Rules"".",p,
VOLCKER RULE,h2,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""Volcker Rule"") prevents ""banking entities"" (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where any of such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in certain financial instruments and (ii) acquiring or retaining any ""ownership interest"" in, or ""sponsoring"", a ""covered fund,"" subject to certain exemptions set forth in the Volcker Rule’s Implementing Regulations.",p,
"An ""ownership interest"" is defined widely in the Volcker Rule and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the ""covered fund"", as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors or other governing body of the ""covered fund"". A ""covered fund"" is defined widely in the Volcker Rule, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""ICA"") but is exempt from registration under the ICA solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution with the intention of excluding such instruments from the definition of ""ownership interest"". However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as ""ownership interests"" in the Issuer by U.S. regulators charged with implementing and enforcing the Volcker Rule.",p,
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a ""covered fund"", the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related implementing regulations, will severely limit the ability of ""banking entities"" to acquire or retain an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer and, with respect to banking entities which have certain business relationships with the Issuer, to enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a ""banking entity"" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in ""ownership interests"" of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by ""banking entities"" in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,
"No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a ""covered fund"" and whether the Notes which they contemplate acquiring constitute ""ownership interests"" for their purposes.

MIFID II Product Governance,h2,
"Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible",p,
"counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (as amended) (""MiFID II""); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.",p,
PRIIPs Regulation,h2,
"The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA"").

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.",p,

RISK FACTORS,h2,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the ""Terms and Conditions"".",p,
1. General,p,
1.1 General,p,
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in loans, bonds and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in ""The Portfolio"". There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular: (i) payments in respect of the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes and (vii) payments in respect of the Class M Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes. Neither the Placement Agent nor the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Placement Agent or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.",p,
1.2 Suitability,p,
"Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,p,
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified and/or prefunded and/or secured.",p,
"Additionally, if an investor in the Notes were to commence litigation relating to the disclosure in this Offering Circular, such litigation would likely be instituted against the Issuer and any liability of the Issuer related thereto would be payable solely from the assets of the Issuer. Further, any award or recourse related thereto would be payable as ""Administrative Expenses"" solely from the Collateral Obligations and all other assets pledged by the Issuer to the Trustee for the benefit of holders of the Notes and other Secured Parties pursuant to the Trust Deed. If distributions on such assets are insufficient to make payments on the Notes and such awards or recourse, no other assets (in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency. Administrative Expenses of the Issuer are senior (but subject to a cap in most instances) to other amounts owing by the Issuer. If the Issuer were required to pay any such amounts it could reduce or eliminate the ability of the Issuer to make payments to the holders of the Notes.",p,
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,p,
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in the regulation of the same may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self- regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if market emergencies occur. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,p,
"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the ""Member States""), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase. The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes may depend on the general economic climate. In addition, the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations or Obligors in respect of other assets comprised in the Portfolio may be adversely affected by a worsening of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations and other assets comprised in the Portfolio are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations and the other assets comprised in the Portfolio would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and the other assets comprised in the Portfolio and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.,p,
"As discussed further below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"In addition, Obligors of Collateral Obligations may be organised in, or otherwise Domiciled in, certain of such countries currently suffering from economic distress, or other countries that may begin to suffer economic distress, and the uncertainty and market instability in any such country may increase the likelihood of default by such Obligor. In the event of its insolvency, any such Obligor, by virtue of being organised in such a jurisdiction or having a substantial percentage of its revenues or assets in such a jurisdiction, may be more likely to be subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in such jurisdiction at the same time as such jurisdiction is itself potentially unstable.",p,
"There exist significant risks for the Issuer and investors as a result of the current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its Collateral Obligations or to purchase new Collateral Obligations in the secondary market,",p,
"(ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to the Maturity Date. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase Collateral Obligations in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing Collateral Obligations. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Portfolio. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (""CLO"") transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Portfolio will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"Some leading global financial institutions have been forced into mergers with other financial institutions, have been partially or fully nationalised or have gone bankrupt or insolvent. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in a Collateral Obligation or is a Hedge Counterparty, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to a Collateral Obligation. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Portfolio and the Notes.",p,
"The result of the above is a significantly more restrictive regulatory environment including the implementation of new accounting and capital adequacy rules in addition to further regulation of derivative or securitised instruments. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Portfolio. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or",p,
investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Portfolio.,p,
"While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.",p,
"1.6 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders",p,
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others,",p,
"(i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,p,
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,
"The deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries has exacerbated the global economic crisis. This situation has also raised a number of uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,
"As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, the European Commission (the ""Commission"") created the European Financial Stability Facility (the ""EFSF"") and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the ""EFSM"") to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Euro zone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the ""ESM""), which was activated by mutual agreement, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries from July 2013 onward.",p,
"Despite these and other measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,
"Further developments in the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis may lead to a variety of different outcomes including further capital controls and may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro zone by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency entirely could have major negative effects on the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for Noteholders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone, may affect their investment in the Notes.",p,
1.8 Referendum on the UK’s EU Membership,p,
"Prospective investors should note that, pursuant to a referendum held in June 2016 (the ""Referendum""), the UK has voted to leave the EU. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (""Article 50"") provides that a Member State which decides to withdraw from the EU is required to notify the European Council of its intention to do so. The UK government invoked Article 50 by notice to the European Council given on 29 March 2017, triggering the beginning of a negotiation period of two years during which the EU and the UK will negotiate and conclude an agreement setting out the arrangements for the UK's withdrawal (""Article 50 Notice Period""). The UK government requested an extension to the Article 50 Notice Period on 20 March 2019. On 21 March 2019, the European Council agreed to an extension of the Article 50 Notice Period until 12 April 2019. On 11 April 2019, the EU and the UK government agreed to a further extension to the Article 50 Notice Period until 31 October 2019.",p,
"To the extent ratification does take place ahead of 31 October 2019, the UK would leave on the first date of the month following ratification. However, it remains uncertain whether the article 50 withdrawal agreement, or any alternative agreement, will be finalised and ratified by the UK and EU ahead of the deadline. If that deadline of 31 October 2019 is not met, unless the negotiation period is further extended or the Article 50 notification revoked, the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU will cease to apply to the UK and the UK will lose access to the EU single market. Whilst continuing to discuss the article 50 withdrawal agreement and political declaration, the UK Government has commenced preparations for a ""hard"" Brexit (or ""no-deal"" Brexit) to minimise the risks for firms and businesses associated with an exit with no transitional agreement. This has included publishing draft secondary legislation under powers provided in the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to ensure that there is a functioning statute book after any exit without a transitional period.",p,
"Until the terms and timing of the UK's exit from the EU are clearer, it is not possible to determine the impact that the Referendum, the UK's departure from the EU and/or any related matters may have on the business of the Issuer (including the performance of the Portfolio), the Collateral Manager (including its ability to manage the Portfolio), one or more of the other parties to the Transaction Documents or any Obligor, or on the regulatory position of any such entity or of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents under EU regulation or more generally. As such, no assurance can be given that such matters would not adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes and/or the market value and/or the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,
"It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established, or at what date (whether by the time when, or after, the UK ceases to be a member of the EU), or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK, and the UK government has indicated that it intends to bring existing EU law into UK law on the date of the UK’s exit from the EU in general, subject to certain powers to deal with deficiencies in such retained EU law. The legislation",p,
"proposed by the UK government to achieve its intentions in this regard, referred to as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, remains subject to political negotiation.",p,
"Given the current uncertainty, prospective investors should note that substantial amendments to English law may occur in connection with the UK’s exit from the EU. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Regulatory Risk,p,
"Currently, under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EU and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, under MiFID II, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries in reliance on passporting rights and without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to whether, following a UK exit from the EU or the EEA (whatever the form thereof), a passporting regime (or similar regime in its effect) will apply (for an implementation period or at all). Depending on the terms of the UK's exit and the terms of any replacement relationship, it is likely that UK regulated entities may, on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.",p,
"It should also be noted that MiFID II and corresponding Regulation 600/2014/EU provide for (among other things) the ability for non-EU investment firms to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis. However, in order to qualify to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis, non-EU investment firms will be required (i) to be authorised in a third country (A) in respect of which the Commission has adopted an equivalency decision and (B) where the European Securities and Markets Authority (""ESMA"") has established cooperation arrangements with the relevant competent authorities, and (ii) to be registered with ESMA to do so. It is not possible to guarantee or predict the timing of any Commission equivalency decision, cooperation arrangements or registration by ESMA and any equivalency determination may be withdrawn.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK's exit from the EU or any replacement relationship will include arrangements for the continuation of a passporting regime (or a similar regime in its effect) or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. The replacement of any such third parties that are no longer able to provide services to the Issuer may result in additional costs and expenses, which may in turn affect the amounts available to pay Noteholders.",p,
Market Risk,p,
"Following the results of the Referendum and throughout the early stages of negotiation between the UK and the EU, the financial markets have experienced some volatility and disruption. This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Investors should be aware that the UK’s exit from the EU (including any related negotiations, notifications, withdrawal and changes to legislation) may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the",p,
"Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Exposure to Counterparties,p,
"The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that if the UK does leave the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU, as noted above, or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the result of the Referendum, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see ""Counterparty Risk"" below.",p,
Ratings actions,p,
"Following the result of the Referendum, in 2016 S&P and Fitch have each downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and each of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s has placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.",p,
"The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.",p,
"While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see ""Counterparty Risk"" below.",p,
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,p,
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.",p,
"Additionally, if an investor in the Notes were to commence litigation relating to the disclosure in this Offering Circular, such litigation would likely be instituted against the Issuer and any liability of the Issuer related thereto would be payable solely from the assets of the Issuer. Further, any award or recourse related thereto would be payable as ""Administrative Expenses"" solely from the Collateral Obligations and all other assets over which the Issuer has granted security to the Trustee for the",p,
"benefit of holders of the Notes and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the Trust Deed. If distributions on such assets are insufficient to make payments on the Notes and such awards or recourse, no other assets (in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency. Administrative Expenses of the Issuer are senior (but subject to a cap in most instances) to other amounts owing by the Issuer. If the Issuer were required to pay any such amounts it could reduce or eliminate the ability of the Issuer to make payments to the holders of the Notes.",p,
2. Taxation,p,
2.1 Financial Transaction Tax,p,
"On 14 February 2013, the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft Directive (the ""Commission Proposal"") for a financial transaction tax (""FTT"") to be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Spain (together excluding Estonia, the ""Participating Member States""). However Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. If the Commission Proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on ""financial institutions"" (which could include the Issuer) in relation to ""financial transactions"" (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments).",p,
"Under the Commission Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ""established"" in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the financial transaction is issued in a Participating Member State.",p,
The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Issuer with respect to certain transactions if it is adopted based on the Commission Proposal. Examples of such transactions are the conclusion of a derivative contract in the context of the Issuer’s hedging arrangements or the purchase or sale of securities (such as charged assets). Any such tax liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and may result in holders of the Notes receiving less than expected in respect of the Notes. It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions by investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation EC No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. There is however uncertainty in relation to the intended scope of this exemption for certain money market instruments and structured issues.,p,
"However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.",p,
2.2 UK Corporation Tax treatment of the Issuer,p,
"In the context of the activities to be carried on or under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.",p,
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.,p,
"The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK through which its business is wholly or partially carried on or it has a dependent agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer in the UK.",p,
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.,p,
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the specific domestic UK tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the ""Investment Manager Exemption"") is available in the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available in the context of this transaction if the Collateral Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent of the Notes.",p,
"However, the inapplicability of this domestic exemption should not have any effect on the UK tax position of the Issuer if the agency is deemed not to be a permanent establishment in the UK under Article 5(6) of the UK-Ireland double-tax treaty (""UK-Ireland Treaty"") (however see the section ""Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting"" below). This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of the UK-Ireland Treaty.",p,
"Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may have the benefit of an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for HM Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"If the UK imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Note Tax Event. If a Note Tax Event were to occur, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event), in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions.",p,
2.3 OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,p,
"International fiscal and taxation policy and practice is constantly evolving and recently the pace of change has increased due to a number of developments. In particular a number of changes of law and practice are occurring as a result of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (""BEPS""). On 5 October 2015, the OECD published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its action plan on BEPS, which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the ""Final Report""). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,
"One of the action points from this project (""Action 6"") is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances.",p,
"As noted above in the risk factor entitled ""UK Corporation Tax treatment of the Issuer"", whether the Issuer will be subject to United Kingdom corporation tax may depend on whether it can benefit from Articles 5 and 8 of the UK-Ireland double tax treaty. Further, the Issuer may rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by Ireland to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply.",p,
"The OECD recommendations on Action 6 are primarily being implemented into double tax treaties through a multilateral instrument (""Multilateral Instrument""). The Multilateral Instrument has been signed by over 75 jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom and Ireland). It entered into force on 1 July 2018 for signatories who deposited their ratification, acceptance or approval on or before 22 March 2018. For signatories who deposited or deposit their ratification, acceptance or approval after 22 March 2018, the Multilateral Instrument comes into force at the start of the month which is three entire calendar months after such deposit takes place. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification on 29 June 2018 and the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 January 2019 and the multilateral instrument came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019.",p,
"Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument the United Kingdom and Ireland each deposited a non- provisional list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions by the inclusion of a principal purpose test (""PPT""). This change will have effect for the United Kingdom- Ireland double tax treaty in relation to withholding taxes from 1 January 2020 and for other taxes from 1 November 2019.",p,
"Once in effect, a PPT would deny a treaty benefit where it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances for this purpose, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is currently unclear how a PPT, if adopted, would be applied by either the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which payments are made to the Issuer or the United Kingdom in relation to the application of Article 5 and 8 of the UK- Ireland double tax treaty).",p,
It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to their double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefit of these treaties.,p,
Consequences of a denial of treaty benefits,p,
,p,
"Provided that the Issuer carries on investment activities as opposed to a trade, the incorporation of the final recommendations for Action 6 in the United Kingdom-Ireland double tax treaty is not expected to affect the Issuer’s exposure to United Kingdom corporation tax.",p,
"However, if the Issuer were to be trading, and if the United Kingdom-Ireland double tax treaty were amended to incorporate the final recommendations for Action 6 then there may be a risk that the Issuer could be treated as having a taxable permanent establishment in the United Kingdom (see the risk factor entitled ""UK Corporation Tax treatment of the Issuer"" above for further information in relation to the circumstances in which the Issuer could be treated as having a UK permanent establishment for UK tax purposes).",p,
"If a Note Tax Event were to occur, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) (in whole but not in part at the direction of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions).",p,
"A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland (such as in the United Kingdom, as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs), in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.",p,
"It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future, which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.",p,
"Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see the risk factor entitled ""EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2"" below) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.",p,
2.4 Withholding Tax on the Notes,p,
"As at the Issue Date, no withholding or deduction for on account of tax is expected to be made by the Issuer in respect of payments of interest on the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, that the payments on the Notes might not in the future become subject to withholding tax.",p,
"Pursuant to Condition 9 (Taxation) the Issuer is entitled to withhold or deduct from any payments in respect of the Notes any amounts for or on account of tax which it is required to do by law. In addition, as described under Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.",p,
"If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,
"In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
2.5 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,p,
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than U.S. withholding tax on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) or, if and to the extent that any such",p,
"withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can, upon the completion of the relevant procedural formalities, be eliminated in full by application being made under a double tax treaty or otherwise or (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make ""gross up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made,",p,
"(b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the borrower or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders).",p,
2.6 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2,p,
"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, and to provide a framework for a harmonised implementation of the BEPS conclusions across the EU, the EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the ""Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive"") on 12 July 2016.",p,
"The EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the ""Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2"") on 29 May 2017, amending the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU member states and third countries.",p,
"EU member states were required to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive by 31 December 2018 (subject to derogations for EU member states which have equivalent measures in their domestic law) and have until 31 December 2019 to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 (except for measures relating to reverse hybrid mismatches, which must be implemented by 31 December 2021).",p,
"The Directives contain various measures that could, depending on their implementation in Ireland, potentially result in certain payments made by the Issuer ceasing to be fully deductible. This could increase the Issuer’s liability to tax and, in certain circumstances, constitute a Note Tax Event.",p,
There are two measures of particular relevance.,p,
"Firstly, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides for an ""interest limitation rule"" which restricts the deductible interest of an entity to 30% of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. However, the interest limitation only applies to the net borrowing costs of an entity (being the amount by which its borrowing costs exceed its taxable interest revenues and other economically equivalent taxable revenues).",p,
"Secondly, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (as amended by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2) provides for hybrid mismatch rules. These rules are designed to neutralise arrangements where amounts are deductible from the income of one entity but are not taxable for another, or the same amounts are deductible for two entities. These provisions could impact entities which ""check the box"" for U.S. tax purposes and are treated as transparent. These rules could potentially apply to the Issuer where: (i) the interest that it pays under the Notes, and claims deductions, from its taxable income for, is not brought into account as taxable income by the relevant Noteholder, either because of the",p,
"characterisation of the Notes, or the payments made under them, or because of the nature of the Noteholder itself; and (ii) the mismatch arises between associated enterprises, between the Issuer and an associated enterprise or under a structured arrangement.",p,
Associated for these purposes includes direct and indirect participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 25 per cent. or more or an entitlement to receive 25 per cent. or more (50 per cent. in certain circumstances) of the profits of that entity as well as entities that are part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes or enterprises that have a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer.,p,
"The exact scope of these two measures, and impact on the Issuer’s tax position, will depend on the implementation of the measures in Ireland.",p,
2.7 Taxation Implications of Reinvestment Amounts,p,
"A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts). Subordinated Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Reinvestment Amount. Subordinated Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment to them of making a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts).",p,
2.8 Diverted Profits Tax,p,
"With effect from 1 April 2015 a new tax was introduced in the United Kingdom called the ""diverted profits tax"" (""DPT""). The DPT is charged at a rate of 25 per cent. on any ""taxable diverted profits"".",p,
The DPT may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure either: (i) that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom for corporation tax purposes through a permanent establishment; or (ii) that a tax reduction is secured through the involvement of entities or transactions lacking economic substance. The DPT is a new tax and its scope and the basis upon which it will be applied by HM Revenue & Customs remains uncertain.,p,
"Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to DPT, it will in certain circumstances be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the Interest Priorities of Payment, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that HM Revenue & Customs would be entitled to seek to assess the Issuer to any diverted profits tax due directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK tax representative. Should the Issuer be assessed directly on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay such amounts in accordance with Interest Priorities of Payment, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable.",p,
"If DPT were to be imposed upon the Issuer or upon the Collateral Manager (in its capacity as UK tax representative of the Issuer), then in certain circumstances the Notes may be redeemed (in whole but not in part) at the option of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders in each case acting by Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event).",p,
2.9 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer,p,
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish law, the provision of collateral management services under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement should be exempt from VAT in Ireland as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a ""qualifying company"" for the purposes of Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 of Ireland, as amended (the ""TCA""). This is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the ""Directive""), which provides that EU member states",p,
"shall exempt the management of ""special investment funds"" as defined by EU member states. The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 of Ireland, in the provisions implementing Article 135(1)(g) of the Directive, specifically lists, in the categories of undertakings to whom supplies of management services are exempt from VAT, undertakings which are ""qualifying companies"" for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA. The Issuer has been advised that it will be such a ""qualifying company"", therefore management services supplied to it are exempt from VAT in Ireland under current law. On 9 December 2015 the European Court of Justice handed down its judgment in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13 which concerned Dutch law on VAT, in particular the Dutch interpretation of the term ""special investment fund"" under the Directive, and could suggest that the exemption had been enacted by some EU member states more broadly than is permitted by the Directive. The Issuer is not, however, aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management services for entities such as the Issuer.",p,
2.10 U.S. Tax Risks,p,
Changes in tax law; imposition of tax on Non-U.S. Noteholders,p,
"Subject to the discussion under ""FATCA"" below, distributions on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Noteholder (as defined in ""Certain Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations"") that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain recognised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Noteholder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the payments or gain are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-",p,
"U.S. Noteholder in the United States or, in the case of gain, the Non-U.S. Noteholder is a non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale, and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Noteholders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.",p,
U.S. trade or business,p,
"Although the Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a ""United States real property interest"" or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to an Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such",p,
"U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
FATCA,p,
"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to",p,
"comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to comply with these regulations. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on ""passthru"" payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain ""foreign financial institutions"" that do not comply with FATCA.",p,
"In the event that a Noteholder (which, for the purposes of Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) may include a nominee or beneficial owner of a Note) fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or to the extent that its ownership of the Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any taxes to which the Issuer is subject under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges, and any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Noteholder as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate securities identifier in the Issuer’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.",p,
Possible treatment of the Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or any other Class of Rated Notes) as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes,p,
"The Issuer intends to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. In general, the characterisation of an instrument for U.S. federal income tax purposes as debt or equity by its issuer as of the time of issuance is binding on a holder. An issuer’s characterisation, however, is not binding on the IRS. In particular, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend, and that a court would not ultimately hold, that the Rated Notes, particularly the Class E Notes or Class F Notes, constitute equity of the Issuer. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or any other Class of Rated Notes) are recharacterised as equity in the Issuer, gain on the sale of such Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Noteholders (as defined in ""Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations"") may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective qualified electing fund election with respect to their Class E Notes or Class F Notes. See ""Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes – Possible Treatment of Rated Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes"". U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications to them if their Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
The Issuer is Expected to be Treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company and May be Treated as a Controlled Foreign Corporation,p,
,p,
"The Issuer is expected to be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which means that a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (and any other Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (any such Notes “Equity Notes”) may be subject to adverse tax consequences, which may otherwise be mitigated if such holder elects to treat the Issuer as a qualified electing fund and to recognise currently its proportionate share of the Issuer’s income whether or not distributed to such U.S. Holder. In addition, depending on the overall",p,
"ownership of interests in the Issuer, a U.S. Holder of 10 per cent. or more, directly, indirectly or constructively, of the Equity Notes may be treated as a U.S. shareholder in a controlled foreign corporation and required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the ""subpart F income"" of the Issuer, whether or not distributed to such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder that makes a qualified electing fund election, or that is required to include subpart F income in the event that the Issuer is treated as a controlled foreign corporation, may recognise income in amounts significantly greater than the payments received from the Issuer. Taxable income may exceed cash payments when, for example, the Issuer uses earnings to repay principal on the Notes or accrues income on the Collateral Obligations prior to the receipt of cash or the Issuer discharges its debt at a discount. A U.S. Holder that makes a qualified electing fund election or that is required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the subpart F income of the Issuer will be required to include in the current income its pro rata share of such earnings, income or amounts whether or not the Issuer actually makes any payments to such Noteholder. The Issuer, or an agent acting on behalf of the Issuer, will cause its independent accountants to supply U.S. Holders of the Equity Notes at such holder’s request and expense with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Holder reasonably requests to satisfy filing requirements under the qualified electing fund election or the controlled foreign corporation rules.",p,
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain,p,
"The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under ""Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations"" below.",p,
3. Regulatory Initiatives,p,
"In Europe, the United States and elsewhere, there is significant focus on fostering greater financial stability through increased regulation of financial institutions, and their corresponding capital and liquidity positions. This has resulted in a number of regulatory initiatives which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an impact on the regulatory position for certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or on the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and none of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Retention Holder, the Agents, the Trustee nor any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the impact of such regulation on investors or the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes in each case, on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the",p,
"U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.",p,
"No representation is made as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences.",p,
"Without limitation to the above, regulatory initiatives which are relevant include the following:",p,
3.1 Basel III,p,
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (""BCBS"") has approved a series of significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being referred to by the BCBS as ""Basel III"") and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio ""backstop"" for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (""LCR"") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio. BCBS member countries agreed to implement the initial phase of the Basel III reforms from 1 January 2013, and the second phase from 1 January 2022, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements. As implementation of Basel III requires national legislation, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of national variation. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been made for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through participating jurisdiction initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in Europe.",p,
"Prospective investors, including credit institutions, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. No predictions can be made as to the precise effects of such matters on any investor or otherwise.",p,
3.2 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements,p,
EU Retention and Transparency Requirements,p,
"The Securitisation Regulation entered into force on 17 January 2018 and has applied since 1 January 2019. The Securitisation Regulation applies to certain parties (including sponsors, original lenders, originators and securitisation special purpose entities (""SSPEs"")) involved in the establishment of EU regulated securitisations, the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019, and to certain institutional investors therein. Among other things, the Securitisation Regulation includes provisions harmonising and replacing the risk retention and due diligence requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) applicable to such investors.",p,
"There are material differences between the regulatory rules which applied to securitisations prior to 1 January 2019 and the regime which now applies pursuant to the Securitisation Regulation. Notably the Securitisation Regulation imposes requirements on a wide range of institutional investors (as defined under the regulation), which includes categories of investors which were not subject to such prior requirements. Investors should therefore make themselves aware of the Securitisation Regulation requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator) and the extent to which such requirements are applicable to them, in addition to any other regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Notes.",p,
"Investors should be aware and in some cases are required to be aware of the risk retention and due diligence requirements in Europe (the ""EU Retention and Transparency Requirements"") which currently apply in respect of various types of EU regulated investors including institutions for occupational retirement, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers who manage or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS) which are set out in the Securitisation Regulation. These requirements restrict such investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have among other things verified that: (i) the originator, sponsor",p,
"or original lender will retain, on an on-going basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with Article 6 of the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the investor in accordance with Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation;",p,
"(ii) the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which, see below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; and (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in points (1) and",p,
"(2) of Article 4(1) of the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge on the Notes acquired by the relevant investor. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remain unclear.",p,
"Relevant investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the information described therein for the purposes of complying with any relevant requirements and none of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Retention Holder, nor any of their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation that the information described therein is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention Notes) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements described above or any other applicable legal or regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, investors should be aware that at this time, the EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements by an institution similar to the Retention Holder including in the context of a transaction involving a separate collateral manager. Furthermore, any relevant regulator's views with regard to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.",p,
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any applicable legal, regulatory or other requirement, then investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes and the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder may be subject to administrative sanctions in the case of negligence or intentional infringement of the requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, including pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Collateral Manager (as Retention Holder) may materially adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to repay principal and pay interest on the Notes. Subject to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer shall not be entitled to indemnification by the Collateral Manager in respect of any such sanction unless the relevant circumstances are caused by a Collateral Manager Breach (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement). Investors should note that Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation refers to a liability standard of ""negligence or intentional infringement"" whereas the definition of Collateral Manager Breach refers to a less onerous liability standard of ""fraud, bad faith, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term",p,
"given its meaning under New York law)"". See risk factor ""Risk Factors – Relating to the Collateral - Collateral Manager"". Investors should therefore be aware that the Issuer could therefore face a pecuniary charge under the Securitisation Regulation as a result of any act by the Collateral Manager triggering the liability of the Issuer under Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation but with such act by the Collateral Manager falling below the less onerous liability standard required for indemnification by the Collateral Manager.",p,
"Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.",p,
"With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the transaction, please see the summary set out in ""The EU Retention and Transparency Requirements"" below.",p,
Required Disclosure,p,
,p,
"Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation contains transparency requirements (the ""Transparency Requirements"") that require the originator, sponsor and securitisation special purpose entity (""SSPE"") of a securitisation to make certain prescribed information relating to the securitisation available to investors, Competent Authorities and, upon request, to potential investors. Article 7 also requires that one party is designated as the reporting entity and the Issuer has been designated as such as further described below.",p,
"Virtus Group LP, acting on behalf of and on the instruction of the Issuer, has made the documentation (as provided to it by the Issuer) referred to in Article 7.1(b) of the Securitisation Regulation available to Noteholders, prospective holders of the Notes and the Competent Authorities via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any Competent Authority and any person that certifies to the Collateral Administrator that it is a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes. Copies of the such documentation shall be made available on such website in substantially agreed form as of the pricing date of the transaction described herein and copies of the final form of such documentation will be available on such website on the Issue Date.",p,
"Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (""Loan Reports""); quarterly investor reports (""Investor Reports""); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (""Inside Information""); and any significant events (""Significant Events"").",p,
"The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not less than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.",p,
"The originator, sponsor and SSPE must designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the disclosure requirements (the ""reporting entity"") under the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity in relation to the issuance of the Notes and shall be liable for ensuring the satisfaction of the disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding the designation of the Issuer as the reporting entity, it is not clear whether the Collateral Manager, as originator, is also responsible for ensuring compliance with the disclosure requirements. If the Collateral Manager is also responsible, and there is a breach of the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, the Collateral Manager could be subject to administrative sanctions, including pecuniary sanctions of up to at least EUR5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or 10 per cent. of its total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Collateral Manager may materially adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. The Collateral Manager may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such pecuniary sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager. See ""The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement – Responsibilities of the Collateral Manager; Indemnities"" below.",p,
"The Collateral Manager has, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, undertaken to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information reasonably required and in its possession and/or control, subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities, the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, the Issuer intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Payment Date Reports, see ""Description of the Reports""). Whether the Collateral Manager will be able to obtain and report all of the information required to be reported in accordance with Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation is unclear. Following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer by compiling and providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall compile and make such information (to the extent not already in its possession, as provided to it by the Collateral Manager or the Issuer) available via a website (or otherwise procure that such information is made available) currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any Competent Authority and any person that certifies to the Collateral Administrator that it is a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to assist the Issuer in compiling and providing such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the Competent Authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes. Any failure by the Issuer to fulfil its obligations in respect of the reporting obligations of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,

The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Transparency RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted revised Transparency RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019. The Commission will now decide whether to adopt these revised Transparency RTS. The European Parliament and the Council then have a period of 3 months following the Commission’s adoption in which they may object to the Transparency RTS.

Currently, there is no dedicated CRA3 RTS template for CLO transactions (other than with respect to content of Investor Reports set out in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS), nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS, however, the Issuer intends to initially make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Payment Date Reports, see ""Description of the Reports"".",p,
"On 30 November 2018 the EBA, ESMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (collectively the ""ESAs"") published a joint statement (the ""Joint Statement"") regarding the reporting templates under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. In the Joint Statement the ESAs note that the reporting templates to be prepared by ESMA for the purposes of fulfilling the on-going disclosure requirements applicable to the relevant reporting entities under the Securitisation Regulation will be unlikely to be adopted by 1 January 2019. The ESAs have stated that they expect national Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that national competent authorities (""CAs"") can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulations (which have applied since 1 January 2019, albeit in a non-standardised manner), take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final adoption of the disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement goes on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the CAs of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,
"In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through preparation of the Payment Date Reports (see ""Description of the Reports"") and which will not be in the form prescribed",p,
"under the CRA3 RTS as none exist for CLO transactions (other than with respect to Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS, as described above). Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not ""grandfather"" transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the final disclosure templates are formally adopted, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation once they are adopted.",p,

U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,
"On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""U.S. Risk Retention Rules"") were issued. Except with respect to asset-backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a ""sponsor"" of asset-backed securities or its ""majority-owned affiliate"" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the ""Minimum Risk Retention Requirement""). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules became effective on 24 December 2016 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by assets other than residential mortgages. As further discussed in the adopting release with respect to the",p,
"U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the entity acting as the collateral manager of a collateralized loan obligation transaction (a ""CLO"") was initially considered the ""sponsor"" of such CLO. However, on 9 February 2018, a three-judge panel (the ""Panel"") of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held, in The Loan Syndications and Trading Association v. Securities and Exchange Commission and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, No. 1:16-cv-0065 ( the ""LSTA Decision""), that collateral managers of ""open market CLOs"" (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from ""arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market"") are not ""securitizers"" or ""sponsors"" under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The Panel's opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on 5 April 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on 3 April 2018 (the ""Mandate"") in respect thereof. As a result of the LSTA Decision, certain CLO managers of ""open market CLOs"" (including the Collateral Manager) may no longer be required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules because of its role as manager of an ""open market CLO"", and there may be no ""sponsor"" of the securitisation transaction and no party may be required to acquire and retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement on the Issue Date in reliance on the Mandate.",p,
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Board"") did not petition the United States Supreme Court for review of the LSTA Decision. However, if it is subsequently determined that this CLO transaction does not constitute an ""open-market CLO"", the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.",p,

"The aim behind the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements described in ""Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives - Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements"" above is that affected investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. of the nominal value of the securitised exposures. This is calculated based on the Collateral Principal Amount (disapplying any haircuts or discounts contained in the definition thereof). The Retention Holder has agreed to comply with such requirement by undertaking to hold Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding as of the Issue Date of not less than five per cent. of (i) on any Business Day prior to the Effective Date, the greater of the Collateral Principal Amount and the Maximum Par Amount and (ii) otherwise, the greater of the Maximum Par Amount and the highest Collateral Principal Amount recorded from and including the Effective Date to the Maturity Date.",p,
Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion could cause the retention holding described above to be insufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (i.e. where the relevant action would cause the Collateral Principal Amount to increase to the extent where it resulted in a Retention Deficiency).,p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Obligations where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency. In the event that the Collateral Manager is so prevented, the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Furthermore, the Issuer may not issue further Notes (a) without the Retention Holder consenting to such issuance and (b) to the extent any such issuance would result in non-compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. The Retention Holder may however direct the Issuer to issue additional Subordinated Notes where necessary in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency, subject to certain conditions being satisfied including that other holders of Subordinated Notes shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Subordinated Notes in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the Subordinated Notes each holder held immediately prior to the additional issuance of Subordinated Notes.",p,
"As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.",p,
3.4 EMIR,p,
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EU) 648/2012, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/834 (""EMIR"") and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose certain obligations on parties to ""over-the-counter"" (""OTC"") derivative contracts according to whether they are ""financial counterparties"" such as investment firms, alternative investment funds, credit institutions and insurance companies, other entities which are ""non-financial counterparties"".",p,
"Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the ""clearing obligation"") all ""eligible"" OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the ""reporting obligation"") (in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates) and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, Portfolio reconciliation and compression",p,
"and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the ""risk mitigation obligations""). Non- cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the ""margin requirement""). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a financial counterparty, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,
"Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain of the risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the aggregate month-end average position in OTC derivative contracts (calculated for the relevant 12-month period in accordance with Article 10 of EMIR) entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non- financial entities within its ""group"" (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a ""group"" (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate month-end average position in OTC derivative contracts (calculated for the relevant 12-month period in accordance with Article 10 of EMIR) of the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,
"Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards. Whilst regulatory technical standards have been published in respect of certain classes of OTC derivative contracts, others are yet to be proposed.",p,
Clearing obligation,p,
"The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under ""Category 1"") to 21 December 2018 (for non-financial counterparties that are not AIFs (as defined below) grouped under ""Category 4"").",p,
Margin requirements,p,
"On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk- mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the ""RTS""). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.",p,
"The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative Portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative Portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin. The requirement to post margin has applied since 1 March 2017.",p,
"If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Collateral Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.",p,
"The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See ""Hedging Arrangements"".",p,
"The Conditions allow the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable at a future date.",p,
"Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non-financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and margin posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Asset Swap Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter Asset Swap Transactions and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk by entering into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
"Prospective investors should also be aware that EMIR has been subject to a review with a view to effect a number of amendments. In particular, on 4 May 2017 the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation amending EMIR as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (the ""Proposal""). The Proposal contained features which may have impacted the Issuer’s ability to hedge the Notes: securitisation special purpose entities such as the Issuer were to be classified as financial counterparties. Financial counterparties (to be subject to a newly introduced clearing threshold per asset class for financial counterparties) are subject to the clearing obligation under EMIR. While the clearing threshold is unlikely to be exceeded by the Issuer, a financial counterparty is subject to the margin rules for uncleared swaps as summarised above. A requirement on the Issuer to post margin, as highlighted above, will adversely affect its ability to enter currency hedge swaps and its ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. On 15 November 2017 and 28 November 2017, the Council of the European Union published its amendments to the Proposal (the ""Compromise Proposal""). The Compromise Proposal deleted the inclusion of securitisation special purpose entities in the financial counterparty definition and this position was confirmed in the text adopted by the European Parliament in plenary session on 12 June 2018. The European Parliament and the Council reached a political agreement on the Compromise Proposal on 5 February 2019 and published the final compromise text (the ""EMIR Refit Regulation""), which was approved to come into force on 17 June 2019.",p,
3.5 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,p,
"EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (""AIFMD"") introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (""AIFs""). If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an ""AIFM""). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD or MiFID II. If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as a ""financial counterparty"" under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations with respect to Hedge Transactions and obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty. See also ""EMIR"" above.",p,
"There is an exemption from the AIFMD for ""securitisation special purpose entities"" (the ""SSPE Exemption""), defined by reference to securitisation within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank of 19 December 2008. ESMA has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, the Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, (i) ""registered financial vehicle corporations"" with the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank, such as the Issuer, and (ii) financial vehicles engaged solely in activities where economic participation is by way of debt or corresponding instruments which do not provide ownership rights in the financial vehicle as are provided by the sale of units or shares, do not need to seek authorisation as, or appoint an, AIFM unless the Central Bank of Ireland issues further guidance advising them to do so.",p,
"If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, then it would need to be managed by an AIFM. If the Collateral Manager is required to be an AIFM, it would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Collateral Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Collateral Manager's management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. If the Collateral Manager was to fail to, or be unable to, be appropriately regulated, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer's assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impair the ability of the Collateral Manager to manage the Issuer's assets may adversely affect the Collateral Manager's ability to carry out the Issuer's investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.",p,
"The Conditions allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable in the future.",p,
3.6 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,p,
"In response to the downturn in the credit markets and the global economic crisis, various agencies and regulatory bodies of the United States federal government and in Europe have taken or are considering taking actions to address the financial crisis. These actions include, but are not limited to, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd- Frank Act""), which was signed into law on 21 July 2010, and which imposes a new regulatory framework over the U.S. financial services industry and the consumer credit markets in general, and proposed and actual regulations by the SEC and the CFTC that may significantly alter the manner in which asset-backed securities, including securities similar to the Notes, are issued and structured and increase the reporting obligations of the issuers and asset managers of such securities.",p,
"Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has promulgated a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with hedge agreements that may be entered into by the Issuer from time to time. Some or all of the Hedge Agreements may be affected by",p,
"requirements for central clearing with a derivatives clearinghouse organisation, by initial and variation margin requirements of clearing organisations or otherwise required by law, reporting obligations in respect of hedge agreements, documentation responsibilities, and other matters that may significantly increase costs to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager or lead to the Issuer’s inability to purchase additional Collateral Obligations or have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the holders. In addition, recently adopted CFTC rules under the Dodd-Frank Act include ""swaps"" along with ""commodities"" as contracts which if traded by an entity may cause that entity to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool"" under the CEA and the Collateral Manager to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool operator"". Although the CFTC has provided guidance that certain securitisation transactions, including CLOs, will be excluded from the definition of ""commodity pool"", it is unclear if such exclusion will apply to all CLOs, and in certain instances, the investment manager of a securitisation vehicle may be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC or apply for an exemption from registration. The requirements of any exemption from regulation of the Collateral Manager as a CPO with respect to the Issuer could cause the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to be subject to registration and reporting requirements that may involve material costs to the Issuer. The scope of the requirements described above and related compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. While the Issuer may be excluded from the definition of ""commodity pool"" or the Collateral Manager may satisfy the requirements of an exemption from the registration requirements described above, the conditions of any such exclusion or exemption may constrain the extent to which the Issuer may be able to enter into swap transactions. In particular, the limits imposed by such exclusion or exemptions may prevent the Issuer from entering into a hedge agreement that the Collateral Manager believes would be advisable or result in the Issuer incurring financial risks that would have been hedged absent such limits.",p,
"The SEC has also proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which have the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could restrict the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. While on 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed (but not adopted) with respect to Regulation AB, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, these may place additional requirements and therefore expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,
"As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
3.7 CFTC Regulations,p,
"Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators in the United States have promulgated a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with Hedge Transactions and the availability of such Hedge Transactions that may be entered into by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) from time to time. Some or all of the Interest Rate Hedge Transactions may be affected by (i) requirements for central clearing with a derivatives clearinghouse organisation, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of clearing organisations or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps and (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,
"Furthermore, regulations requiring the collection and posting of variation margin on uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in the United States on 1 March 2017 for all registered swap dealers with respect to variation margin (subject to limited relief) and are being phased-in for registered swap dealers between 1 September 2016 and 1 September 2020 with respect to initial margin. While transactions existing prior to that date are expected to be exempt from such requirement, new Hedge Transactions would be subject to it, as might existing Hedge Transactions that undergo a material amendment, based on guidance provided and positions taken by U.S. regulators in other contexts. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of U.S. regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material, adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.",p,
3.8 Commodity Pool Regulation,p,
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a ""commodity pool"" as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (""CEA"") and the Collateral Manager to be a ""commodity pool operator"" (""CPO"") and/or a ""commodity trading advisor"" (a ""CTA""), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd- Frank Act, defines a ""commodity pool"" to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in ""commodity interests"" which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool"" under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of ""swap"" as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that none of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its or their affiliates or any other person would be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer, as such, provided they satisfy the Hedging Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time such Hedge Transaction are entered into or the Collateral Manager seeks legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that none of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its or their affiliates or any other person would be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"If trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a ""commodity pool"", the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) as in effect on the Issue Date. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer. Additionally, unlike a registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC disclosure document to prospective investors, nor would it be required to provide investors with certified annual reports that satisfy the requirements of CFTC rules applicable to registered CPOs. Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the ""NFA"") pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool"" under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. In addition, if an exemption from registration were available and the Collateral Manager elected to file for an exemption, the Collateral Manager would not be required to",p,
"deliver certain CFTC mandated disclosure documents or a certified annual report to investors or satisfy on-going compliance requirements under Part 4 of the CFTC Regulations, as would be the case for a registered CPO or CTA. Further, the conditions of such exemption may constrain the extent to which the Issuer may be able to enter into swap transactions. In particular, the limits imposed by such exemptions may prevent the Issuer from entering into a Hedge Transaction that the Collateral Manager believes would be advisable or result in the Issuer incurring financial risks that would have been hedged pursuant to swap transactions absent such limits. In addition, the costs of obtaining and maintaining such exemption will be passed on to the Issuer.",p,
"Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,
3.9 Volcker Rule,p,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""Volcker Rule"") prevents ""banking entities"" (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any ""ownership interest"" in, or in ""sponsoring"", a ""covered fund,"" subject to certain exemptions.",p,
"An ""ownership interest"" is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the ""covered fund"", as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment adviser, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the ""covered fund"". A ""covered fund"" is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the ""ICA"") but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see ""Commodity Pool Regulation"", above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.",p,
"The Transaction Documents provide that the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution with the intention of excluding such instruments from the definitions of ""ownership interest"". However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as ""ownership interests"" in the Issuer by U.S. regulators charged with implementing and enforcing the Volcker Rule.",p,
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in",p,
resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.,p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a ""covered fund"", then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of ""banking entities"" to hold an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a ""banking entity"" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in ""ownership interests"" of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisers and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by ""banking entities"" in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,
"No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a ""covered fund"" for their purposes.",p,
3.10 CRA,p,
"Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (""CRA3"") came into force on 20 June 2013.Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisers as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.",p,
3.11 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,p,
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that U.S. federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the U.S. federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
3.12 Flip Clauses,p,
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payments which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (""flip clauses""), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the ""anti-deprivation"" principles of English",p,
and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.,p,
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that, provided such provisions form part of a commercial transaction entered into in good faith which does not have as its predominant purpose, or one of its main purposes the deprivation of the property of one of the parties on bankruptcy, the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) (the ""BNY Case"") examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is an unenforceable ipso facto clause under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) (the ""U.S. Bankruptcy Code""). Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision ""directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts"". While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is ""flipped"" or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY Case to cases where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payments, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the",p,
"particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payments would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.Moreover, if the Priorities of Payments are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payments, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payments and as a result, the Issuer's ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,
"Lastly, given the general relevance of the issues under discussion in the judgments referred to above and that the Transaction Documents will include terms providing for the subordination of termination payments in certain circumstances, there is a risk that the final outcome of the dispute in such judgments (including any recognition action by the English courts) may result in negative rating pressure in respect of the Notes. If any rating assigned to the Notes is lowered, the market value of the Notes may reduce.",p,
3.13 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform,p,
"Various interest rate benchmarks (including the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (""EURIBOR"") are the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",p,
"The LIBOR has been reformed, with developments including:",p,
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);,p,
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers' Association in February 2014;,p,
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and,p,
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.,p,
CE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.,p,
"In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.",p,
"The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.",p,
"It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so.",p,
"However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.",p,
"The EURIBOR together with LIBOR and other so-called ""benchmarks"" are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.",p,
"Additionally, in March 2017, the European Money Markets Institute (formerly Euribor-EBF) (the ""EMMI"") published a position paper referring to certain proposed reforms to EURIBOR, which reforms aim to clarify the EURIBOR specification, to develop a transaction-based methodology for EURIBOR and to align the relevant methodology with the Benchmarks Regulation (as defined below), the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks and other regulatory recommendations. The EMMI has since indicated that there has been a ""change in market activity as a result of the current regulatory requirements and a negative interest rate environment"" and ""under the current market conditions it will not be feasible to evolve the current EURIBOR methodology to a fully transaction- based methodology following a seamless transition path"". It is the current intention of the EMMI to develop a hybrid methodology for EURIBOR.",p,
"In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the ""Benchmark Regulation"") on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmark Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. It is directly applicable law across the EU. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.",p,
"The Benchmark Regulation applies principally to ""administrators"" and also, in some respects, to ""contributors"" and certain ""users"" of ""benchmarks"", and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmark Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of ""benchmarks"" provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmark Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called ""critical benchmark"" indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including ""proprietary"" indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. By way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively, EURIBOR was identified as a ""critical benchmark"" for the purposes of the Benchmark Regulation.",p,
"Benchmarks such as LIBOR or EURIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmark Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.",p,
Potential effects of the Benchmark Regulation include (among other things):,p,
"(a) an index which is a ""benchmark"" could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and",p,
"(b) the methodology or other terms of the ""benchmark"" could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.",p,
Investors should be aware that:,p,
"(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of ""benchmarks"" could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a ""benchmark"" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain ""benchmarks"", trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain ""benchmarks"" or lead to the disappearance of certain ""benchmarks"";",p,
"(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:,p,
"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,
"(ii) in the case of a change to LIBOR, there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Transaction and/or Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Transaction and/or Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Transaction and/or Hedge Agreement;",p,
"(d) in the case of a change to EURIBOR, if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest); and",p,
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Notes.,p,
"In general, any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR or LIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes. No assurance may be provided that relevant changes will not be made to LIBOR or EURIBOR and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.",p,
Investors should consider these recent developments when making their investment decision with respect to the Refinancing Notes.,p,
"Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend such reference rates in the context of the Transaction Documents. Condition 14(c)(xxx) provides that the Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, enter into one or more supplemental trust deeds or make any other modification or waive any provision of any Transaction Document to change the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes from EURIBOR to the Alternative Base Rate.",p,
"3.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures",p,
"Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the ""AML Requirements""). Any of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Agents could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith. A Noteholder may also be obliged to provide information they may have previously identified or regarded as confidential to satisfy the Issuer AML Requirements.",p,
3.15 Regulated Banking Activity,p,
"While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities ""in"" certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, ""Regulated Banking Activities"") is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non- bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
3.16 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,p,
"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the ""BRRD"") equips national authorities in Member States (the ""Resolution Authorities"") with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, ""relevant institutions""). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for",p,
"example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of ""bail-in"" powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to ""bail-in"" the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.",p,
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (""Stay Regulations""), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (""SRRs"") vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (""PRA"") has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to ""stays"" under SRRs.",p,
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the ""SRB"") and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the ""SRM Regulation""). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,
4. Relating To The Notes,p,
4.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,
"Neither the Arranger nor the Placement Agent (or any of their affiliates) is under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or",p,
"directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See ""Plan of Distribution"" and ""Transfer Restrictions"". Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit the liquidity of Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes and CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes.",p,
"In addition, Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes are not exchangeable at any time for Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non- Voting Notes may be exchanged for Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit their liquidity.",p,
"Investors in the Class M Notes should note that no such Notes or interest therein may be transferred to or held by a Benefit Plan Investor. See ""Forced Transfer"" and the section of this Offering Circular entitled ""Certain ERISA Considerations"" below.",p,
4.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,p,
"The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may, in some cases, require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and certain other amounts.",p,
4.3 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class,p,
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:,p,
(a) in the case of a redemption on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution;,p,
"(b) (together with the Subordinated Notes), following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event upon the earlier of (i) the date upon which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee and the Noteholders that it is not able to cure the Note Tax Event and (ii) the date which is 90 days from the date upon which the Issuer first becomes aware of such Note Tax Event, at the direction of (x) the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution or (y) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution; or",p,
"(c) on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event in whole (with respect to all Classes of Rated Notes) at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution,",p,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out herein. Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).),p,
"As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing), subject to certain conditions, the Rated Notes may be redeemed in part by Class from Refinancing Proceeds at the applicable Redemption Prices, from any Refinancing Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period at the direction of (i) the Collateral Manager or (ii) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution), at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date to redeem such Class of Rated Notes. Any such redemption shall be of an entire Class or Classes of Notes subject to a number of conditions. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). To the extent U.S. Retention Regulations apply to any Refinancing or issuance of additional Notes, the ability of the Issuer and the Noteholders to issue additional notes or enter into a Refinancing may be impacted. See ""Risk Factors—Regulatory Initiatives— Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—U.S. Risk Retention Rules"".",p,
"Following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, the Issuer shall redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 20 per cent. of the Target Par Amount, subject to (i) the right of the holders of not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Subordinated Notes to object to such redemption; and (ii) the right of the Collateral Manager to object to such redemption, in each case in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Transaction Documents to the extent the Issuer or the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Notes other than the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,
"The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Payment Date on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes (subject, in the case of an Optional Redemption of the Rated Notes in whole, to the right of holders of 100 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of any Class of Rated Notes to elect to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to the holders of such Class of Rated Notes) at the direction of the Collateral Manager or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution).",p,
"In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.",p,
"Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.",p,
4.4 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the option of the Collateral Manager,p,
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion provides written certification to the Trustee (on which the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it (A) has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days using commercially reasonable endeavours, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional or Substitute Collateral Obligations or (B) at any time after the Effective Date but during the Reinvestment Period, has determined, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, that a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,
4.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes,p,
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Class F Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including in relation to mandatory redemption following the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,
"If (i) the Class A/B Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or (ii) the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.",p,
"If (i) the Class C Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or (ii) the Class C Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.",p,
"If (i) the Class D Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or (ii) the Class D Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter",p,
"Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.",p,
"If the Class E Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.",p,
"If the Class F Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.",p,
4.6 The Reinvestment Period may terminate early,p,
"The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following an Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager notifies the Issuer, the Rating Agencies and the Trustee that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.",p,
4.7 The Collateral Manager may reinvest after the end of the Reinvestment Period,p,
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received with respect to the Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See ""The Portfolio",p,
"— Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period"" below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,
4.8 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and an Event of Default,p,
Additional Issuances,p,
"At any time, subject to certain conditions (including the prior approval of the Retention Holder), the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes (other than the Class X Notes and the Class M Notes) and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) to be applied as Interest Proceeds. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,
Redirection of funds to reinvestment,p,
"The Collateral Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds or the Subordinated Noteholders may in certain circumstances designate Reinvestment Amounts, in each case to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses.",p,
Collateral Manager Advances,p,
The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(j)(xiv) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. The Collateral Manager may earn a rate of interest based on EURIBOR plus,p,
1.0 per cent. per annum.,p,
Reinvestment Amounts,p,
"The Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts) by contributing assets to the Issuer either directly or indirectly by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will decide (in consultation with the relevant Subordinated Noteholder but at the discretion of the Collateral Manager) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.",p,
"Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent an Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see ""Average Life and Prepayment Considerations"" below).",p,
4.9 Limited Recourse Obligations,p,
"The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Retention Holder, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Noteholders of any Class, the Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, the Corporate Services Provider or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on and proceeds of realisation of the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Noteholders, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, the Corporate Services Provider or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class M Noteholders (with respect to the Subordinated Class M Return Amount only); (c) thirdly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) fourthly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fifthly, the Class D Noteholders; (e) sixthly, the Class C Noteholders; (f) seventhly, the Class B Noteholders; and (g) lastly, the Class X",p,
"Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders (on a pro rata and pari passu basis), in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, examinership, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer.",p,
4.10 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,p,
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, then the filing or presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such filing or presentation being deemed to be a preferential transfer subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.",p,
4.11 Subordination of the Notes,p,
"The Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes; the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes; the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes; the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes; the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes; the Class M Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes; and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes.",p,
"The payment of principal on any Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account if the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met on any Determination Date during the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to paragraphs (E) and (W) of the Interest Priority of Payments, Interest Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class M Notes in circumstances where one or more Classes of Rated Notes remain Outstanding in accordance with Condition 7(m) (Redemption of the Class M Notes).",p,
"Non-payment of any Interest Amounts due and payable in respect of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute an Event of Default (where such non- payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission after the Collateral Administrator or Paying Agent receives notice of or has actual knowledge of such error or omission). Non-payment of any Interest Amounts due and payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes pr failure to pay the Class M Return Amount, will not constitute an Event of Default (including where any such Class is the Controlling Class (where applicable)).",p,
"In the event of any acceleration of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Subordinated Noteholders, then by the Class M Noteholders, then by the Class F Noteholders, then by the Class E Noteholders, then by the Class D Noteholders, then by the Class C Noteholders, then by the Class B Noteholders and, finally, (on a pro rata and pari passu basis) by the Class A Noteholders and the Class X Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders, the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class M Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class M Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of: (i) the Class X Noteholders and Class A Noteholders (on a pro rata and pari passu basis) over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders and (vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. In the event that the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class which is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or",p,
"other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes, provided that such action is consistent with the applicable law and with all other provisions of the Trust Deed. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).",p,
4.12 Calculation of Rate of Interest,p,
"If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Rate of Interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Issuer is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the Collateral Manager shall use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a replacement index subject to the consent of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution, which shall be used to calculate the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest instead of EURIBOR in accordance with Condition 6(e)(i)(A) (Floating Rate of Interest). Any such designation may reduce the amount of interest proceeds available for distribution to Subordinated Noteholders if the designated index were higher than EURIBOR and Subordinated Noteholders may therefore be adversely affected by such designation.",p,
"If no replacement index were designated in the manner described above, the relevant Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis.",p,
4.13 Amount and Timing of Payments,p,
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes or payment of the Subordinated Class M Return Amount are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, the Class M Notes) as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, pay the Subordinated Class M Return Amount or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments, will not be an Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the,p,
"Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"As described above, failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, or to pay or the Subordinated Class M Return Amount will not be an Event of Default (including where any such Class is the Controlling Class). Noteholders of such Classes of Notes will consequently have no right to accelerate their Notes or to direct that the Trustee take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral to recover the principal amount of their Notes Outstanding in such circumstances.",p,
4.14 Reports Will Not Be Audited,p,
"The Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports and, to the extent agreed by the Collateral Administrator, the Investor Reports and the Loan Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, in consultation with and based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,
4.15 Future Ratings of the Rated Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. In the event that a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.",p,
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations,p,
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Notes.",p,
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.",p,
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the Arranger,p,
"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the ""arranger"" (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the arranger is the Issuer.",p,
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (""Unsolicited Ratings"") which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any",p,
"Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,
"The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation (an ""NRSRO"") for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
4.16 Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes,p,
"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of ""due diligence services"" for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute ""due diligence services"" under Rule 17g-10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute ""due diligence services"" under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,
4.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,p,
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is 15 October 2032; however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the issuers of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such loans, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future",p,
defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.,p,
"Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain",p,
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,
4.18 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,p,
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes or the Class M Notes may be subject to a partial or a 100 per cent. loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and/or the Class M Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and/or the Class M Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and/or the Class M Notes. See ""Mandatory Redemption of the Notes"" above.",p,
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to any particular Class of Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,
4.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,p,
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes. Consequently, it is",p,
anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of an Event of Default on or about that date.,p,
4.20 Security,p,
"Clearing Systems: Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian on account for the Issuer and",p,
(ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement (each as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.,p,
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through The Depositary Trust Company, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Hedge Counterparties, the Corporate Services Provider or any other party.",p,
"Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
"4.21 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",p,
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required",p,
quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.,p,
"In the event that a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting and which are voted. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter.",p,
"There are, however, quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider a Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and, in the case of an Ordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution.",p,
"In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed. Any such Resolution may be adverse to any Class of Noteholders or to any group of Noteholders or individual Noteholders within any Class.",p,
"Certain decisions, including the removal of the Collateral Manager, instructing the Trustee to accelerate the Notes and instructing the Trustee to sell the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes require authorisation by the Noteholders of a Class or Classes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution).",p,
"Notes constituting the Controlling Class that are in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non- Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution. As a result, for so long as any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes constitute the Controlling Class, only Notes that are in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes may vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or a CM Replacement Resolution.",p,
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
Notes in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution or a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes and/or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes will be bound by such Resolution.,p,
"Noteholders of the CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.",p,
"Investors in the Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as the Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.",p,
"Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or a CM Replacement Resolution, such Class of Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.",p,
"Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders. Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, the Reinvestment Criteria or the Collateral Quality Tests and the related definitions, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained and (to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) the Controlling Class has consented by way of Ordinary Resolution.",p,
"In connection with any Resolution, no Class M Notes shall constitute or form part of the Controlling Class.",p,
"Investors should note that for the purposes of determining voting rights attributable to the Notes and the applicable quorum at any meeting of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution), the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall together be deemed to constitute a single Class in respect of any voting rights specifically granted to them (including as the Controlling Class). As a consequence, holders of the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes, in each case shall act not separately, but together as a single Class for voting purposes, including in relation to amendments where the interests of Noteholders of a particular tranche within any such Class may not be aligned with the interests of Noteholders in other tranches within such Class.",p,
"In addition, potential investors should note that the Issuer may be prevented from making certain amendments or modifications which would otherwise be beneficial to the transaction due to the requirements set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) to obtain the consent of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution.",p,
"Certain entrenched rights relating to the Conditions including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of a Resolution cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders. In particular, Noteholders should note that amendments as may be",p,
"contemplated or required to facilitate an Optional Redemption in whole or in part by way of a Refinancing and the relevant Refinancing Obligations may be effected by way of Ordinary Resolution and, as such, fundamental amendments including, but not limited to, an extension of the Reinvestment Period and/or Maturity Date may be effected with the approval of a simple majority of each relevant Class of Noteholders. Noteholders should further note that any amendment made contemporaneously with an Optional Redemption in whole or in part by way of a Refinancing and the relevant Refinancing Obligations may be effected by way of Ordinary Resolution and, as such, fundamental amendments including, but not limited to, an extension of the Reinvestment Period and/or Maturity Date may be effected with the approval of a simple majority of each relevant Class of Noteholders. In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to the Issuer certifying to the Trustee that such modifications and waivers are required pursuant to Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).",p,
"Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent a modification of the Transaction Documents which may have been beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders or in a manner required in order to ensure regulatory compliance.",p,
4.22 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes,p,
"If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause are at the direction of Noteholders of specified percentages of the Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).",p,
4.23 Enforcement Rights Following an Event of Default,p,
"If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following an Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) of the definition thereof, such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.",p,
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith), would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Class M Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; or otherwise (B) in the case of an Event of Default, the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default.",p,
"The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,
4.24 Certain ERISA Considerations,p,
"Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (""ERISA"") or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, ""Plans"") invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes or the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered ""prohibited transactions"" under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled ""Certain ERISA Considerations"" below.",p,
4.25 Forced Transfer,p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA (including without limitation, the deemed representation by a purchaser of Class M Notes that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor).",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines at any time that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a ""U.S. Person"") and is not both a QIB and a QP (any such person, a ""Non-Permitted Noteholder"") or that any holder of an interest in a Note is a Noteholder that has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction, Benefit Plan Investor, Controlling Person, Other Plan Law, Similar Law or other ERISA representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or whose ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in the Plan Asset Regulation (a ""Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder""), the Issuer may, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) demanding that such Noteholder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non- Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) within 30 days (or 10 days in the case of a Non- Permitted ERISA Noteholder) of the date of such notice. If such Holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder), (a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder; and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.",p,
"In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does",p,
"not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder. See Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA).",p,
5. Relating To The Collateral,p,
5.1 The Portfolio,p,
"The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"Neither the Issuer nor the Placement Agent has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Custodian, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Corporate Services Provider or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Placement Agent, the Arranger or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence as it considers reasonably necessary in accordance with the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.",p,
5.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds), Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of",p,
"principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See ""The Portfolio"" section of this Offering Circular.",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each of the Classes of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are ""Defaulted Obligations"".",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation (in each case in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trust Deed and each other applicable Transaction Document), the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
5.3 Warehouse Arrangements,p,
"Prior to the Issue Date (such period, the ""Warehouse Period""), the Collateral Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, Collateral Obligations (each a ""Warehoused Asset"") pursuant to financing arrangements (the ""Warehouse Arrangements""). The Warehouse Arrangements were provided primarily by one or more Affiliates of the Placement Agent (the ""Citi Parties""), as senior lender, and certain subordinated lenders (the ""Warehouse Providers""). The primary purpose of the Warehouse Arrangements was to facilitate acquisition by the Issuer of Collateral Obligations during the Warehouse Period and, accordingly, benefit from the economics and voting rights of such Collateral Obligations. The Warehouse Arrangements will be terminated on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Citi Parties and the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements will be repaid by the Issue Date from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use,p,
the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Citi Parties and the other Warehouse Providers in respect of the funds provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date.,p,
"Under the Warehouse Arrangements, the Citi Parties indirectly provided and will provide prior to the Issue Date financing to the Issuer to allow its acquisition of the Warehoused Assets (provided that the Citi Party approves the purchase of any such Warehoused Assets). The approval by any Citi Parties of the purchase of any Warehoused Assets will be in its capacity as the financing party and should not be viewed as a determination by Citi as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether it will satisfy the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer. If the Citi Parties do not approve the purchase of any Warehoused Assets, the Issuer may be restricted from purchasing that asset for a certain period, which may result in the Issuer paying a higher price.",p,
"The Warehouse Providers have, during the Warehouse Period, provided certain of the junior funding to the Issuer. On the Issue Date, such junior funding will be redeemed at par plus the interest accrued on the Warehoused Assets (net of a financing fee due to the Citi Parties and any other expenses and fees due under the Warehouse Arrangements). Certain of the Warehouse Providers may, but are not required to, purchase any Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. If the Issue Date occurs, any losses or gains (realised or unrealised) resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets, will be for the account of the Issuer. If the Issue Date does not occur, the Warehouse Providers and the applicable Citi Parties will bear the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets. The interests of the Citi Parties and the Warehouse Providers in respect of the Warehoused Assets will not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.",p,
"The prices paid for Collateral Obligations purchased pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer's control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to or on the Issue Date.",p,
"In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the Warehouse Period will be paid to the Warehouse Providers under the Warehouse Arrangements on or about the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the Warehouse Period but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during the Warehouse Period provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the relevant Warehouse Providers under the Warehouse Arrangements. On and following the Issue Date, any losses or gains (realised or unrealised) resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets will be for the account of the Issuer. On and following the Issue Date the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets is for the account of the Issuer (and therefore the Noteholders), including in respect of the period prior to the Issue Date. The interests of the participants in the Warehouse Arrangements in respect of the Warehoused Assets may not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.",p,
"The financing provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date by applying part of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes. Certain costs and expenses related to the Warehouse Arrangements, including the interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the Warehouse Arrangements and payment of certain fees and reimbursement of certain expenses to such lender and any agents appointed in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, will therefore be borne by the Issuer as such amounts will be paid by application of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
"The price and availability of a Collateral Obligation may be adversely affected by a number of market factors, including price volatility of Collateral Obligations and the availability of investments suitable for the Issuer, each of which could hamper the ability of the Issuer to acquire an initial portfolio of Collateral Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and the Effective Date Determination Requirements prior to the Effective Date. Delays in reaching the Target Par Amount may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Rated Notes and the distributions on the Subordinated Notes.",p,
The prices of the Rated Notes will be fixed on the pricing date. The actual purchase prices of the Warehoused Assets purchased after the pricing date were not known at that time and may be higher or lower than the purchase prices expected on the pricing date. The returns on Subordinated Notes will vary depending upon the actual purchase prices of the Warehoused Assets and Collateral Obligations purchased on or after the Issue Date and may be materially different from the expected returns calculated based upon market prices prevailing at the pricing date.,p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be ""undervalued"" levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
"In circumstances where the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase Collateral Obligations, events occurring between the date of such commitment and the settlement date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer's control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of such Collateral Obligations during such intervening period and will be risks borne by the Issuer (and, indirectly, the Noteholders).",p,
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only (i) at the time that any binding commitment to acquire a Collateral Obligation is entered into (ii) in respect of Issue Date Collateral Obligations, on the Issue Date and (iii) in respect of certain of the Eligibility Criteria that comprise the Restructured Obligation Criteria, those Collateral Obligations which are the subject of a restructuring (whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor), on the applicable Restructuring Date, and, in each case, any failure by such Collateral Obligation to satisfy the relevant Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.",p,
"See also ""Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Related to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates"" below in relation to conflicts concerning the Placement Agent.",p,
5.4 Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period,p,
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy each of the Coverage Tests (other than",p,
"the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and following the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests and Target Par Amount requirement as at the Effective Date. See ""The Portfolio"". The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Notes.",p,
"Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
5.5 Underlying Portfolio,p,
"Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that, as of the Effective Date, at least 90.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Investors should note that Secured Senior Obligations may consist of Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds but there is no restriction under the Portfolio Profile Tests on the proportion of Secured Senior Bonds and Secured Senior Loans constituting such Secured Senior Obligations. Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Secured Senior Obligations and Unsecured Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Obligations are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks,",p,
"patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Secured Senior Loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer. See also ""Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders"" in respect of the Issuer’s interest in syndicated loan facilities.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example High Yield Bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed in the section titled ""Interest Rate Risk"" below.",p,
"The majority of Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
"Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees. In addition, Collateral Obligations in the form of floating rate notes are similar in nature",p,
"to Cov-Lite Loans and typically do not provide for financial covenants and thus, may result in difficulties in triggering a default. See ""Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks"" below.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement including such Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk in the event that such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its bondholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Senior Loan.",p,
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Loan and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Loans. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,
Mezzanine Obligations are likely to be subject to intercreditor arrangements that may include restrictions on the ability of the holders of the relevant Mezzanine Obligations from taking independent enforcement action.,p,
Prepayment Risk,p,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
Credit Risk,p,
"Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations generally also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such loans and obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and senior, mezzanine and high-yield obligations and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.",p,
Defaults and Recoveries,p,
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or Mezzanine Obligation often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative investment managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan or debt obligation is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity or an extension of its maturity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted",p,
"Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders or investors. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,
"In some European jurisdictions, obligors or lenders may seek a ""scheme of arrangement"". In such instance, a lender or other debt investor may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See ""Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations"" below.",p,
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Obligations. Such Collateral Obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Obligations occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants. Ownership of Cov- Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such Collateral Obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loan as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable Obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.",p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed",p,
by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.,p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process may leave the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See ""Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations"" below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.",p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the Obligor. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first",p,
"lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) ""debtor-in-possession"" financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,
"For the purposes of the foregoing, ""Senior Loan"" means a Collateral Obligation that is a Secured Senior Loan, an Unsecured Senior Loan or a Second Lien Loan.",p,
Corporate Rescue Loans,p,
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing a Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investment in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan may be unsecured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are no subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,
Bridge Loans,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.",p,
Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or out of a Collateral Manager Advance. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amounts which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are subject to the following caps: (i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €3,500,000 and (ii) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all Payment Dates may not exceed €10,500,000. During the Reinvestment Period, Reinvesting Noteholders may also direct that a Reinvestment Amount in respect of their Subordinated Notes be deposited into the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion and up to a maximum of three times in aggregate, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, a ""Collateral Manager Advance"") to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, provided that (A) each of the Par Value Tests is satisfied at the time of making such Collateral Manager Advance and (B) such proposed Collateral Manager Advance (i) is of an amount equal to or greater than EUR1,000,000 and (ii) would not cause a Retention Deficiency. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account may also or alternatively be used to fund the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations. There can therefore be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. If sufficient amounts are not so available, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, fund the payment of any shortfall by way of a Collateral Manager Advance. However, the Collateral Manager is under no obligation to make any Collateral Manager Advance. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests.",p,
5.6 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,p,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its",p,
portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.,p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
"5.7 Participations, Novations and Assignments",p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a ""Selling Institution"". Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as ""Assignments"". Interests in loans acquired indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as ""Participations"".",p,
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited",p,
"interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institution may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors. In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the ""bail- in"" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See ""EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive"" above. Participations expose the Issuer to the credit risk of the relevant Selling Institution - see further ""Counterparty Risk"" below. Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.",p,
5.8 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
5.9 Counterparty Risk,p,
"Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as",p,
"the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents, and shall in each case notify the Rating Agencies of such replacement.",p,
"Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the ""bail-in"" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See ""EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive"" above.",p,
5.10 Concentration Risk,p,
"The Issuer will invest in a Portfolio of Collateral Obligations consisting primarily of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds. Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See ""The Portfolio — Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests"".",p,
5.11 Interest Rate Risk,p,
"The Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. The Class B- 2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. Certain Notes accrue interest at a floating rate. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.",p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there may be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, floating rate basis mismatch (including in the case of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments which pay a floating rate based on a benchmark other than EURIBOR), maturity date mismatch and mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes taken as a whole and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of the applicable floating rate benchmark could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatches from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof and subject to satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, discussed in the section titled ""Commodity Pool Regulation"" above. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory",p,
"matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer’s exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See further ""Hedging Arrangements"" below.",p,
"Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a quarterly basis prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and on a semi-annual basis following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations pay interest on a semi- annual or annual basis, there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes (at all times prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event). In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mismatch, prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Issuer will be required to hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (""Interest Smoothing""). There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing mismatch.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes, that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes or that any Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions would be sufficient to mitigate any interest rate risk.",p,
"A Non-Euro Obligation may be subject to a LIBOR or other benchmark floor which, to the benefit of the Issuer, will set a minimum level of interest receivable by the Issuer. However, if the Issuer has entered into a Currency Hedge Transaction pursuant to which the Issuer pays the relevant Hedge Counterparty the floored amount of interest and receives in return an amount determined by reference to EURIBOR but without a floor, the benefit of the floor under the terms of the Non-Euro Obligation for the Issuer may be negated by such Currency Hedge Transaction. It is not a requirement for Currency Hedge Transactions to determine such EURIBOR on a floored basis to match the terms of such relevant Non-Euro Obligation so as to preserve the floor for the benefit of the Issuer. Any such mismatch will reduce the net amounts earned by the Issuer in respect of Non-Euro Obligations and, therefore, reduce the amount payable to Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"Furthermore, the Issuer is exposed to interest rate risk by virtue of the Accounts. As interest rate levels fluctuate over time, the Issuer may be entitled to a lower rate of interest on some or all Accounts or, in some circumstances, may be required to pay negative interest rate charges to the Account Bank (which would be payable as Administrative Expenses subject to the Priorities of Payment). Any such lower or negative rate interest charges will reduce the funds available for the Issuer to make distributions in respect of the Notes.",p,
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,
5.12 Currency Risk,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 20.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Non-Euro Obligations. Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition and the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may purchase Non- Euro Obligations, provided that such Non-Euro Obligations otherwise satisfy the Eligibility Criteria.",p,
"Although the Issuer shall, subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, enter into Currency Hedge Transactions to hedge any currency exposure relating to such Non-Euro Obligations, fluctuations in exchange rates may lead to the proceeds of the Collateral Obligations being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Notes. The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is also authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations are required to have an associated Currency Hedge Transaction which will include currency protection provisions, losses may be incurred due to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rates and in the event of a default by the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty under any such Currency Hedge Transaction. In addition, fluctuations in Euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof upon enforcement of the security over it. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See further ""Hedging Arrangements"" below.",p,
"In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial up-front payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, and the Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including any termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.",p,
"In the case of a Non-Euro Obligation which is subject to a LIBOR or other benchmark floor, it is not a requirement for Currency Hedge Transactions to determine EURIBOR on a floored basis to match the terms of such relevant Non-Euro Obligation so as to preserve the floor for the benefit of the Issuer. See ""Interest Rate Risk"".",p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events increase the risk of a mismatch between the Currency Hedge Transactions and the Non-Euro Obligations which may result in losses. In addition, the Collateral Manager may be limited at the time of reinvestment in the choice of Non-Euro Obligations that it is able to purchase on behalf of the Issuer because of the cost of such hedging and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect to such hedging. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See ""EMIR"", ""CFTC Regulations"" and ""Commodity Pool Regulation"".",p,
"The Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its currency risk exposure.",p,
5.13 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,
"To the extent the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described",p,
"herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds (see ""The Collateral Manager may reinvest after the end of the Reinvestment Period"". The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount. Any decrease in the yield on the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the other Classes of Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes, the Class M Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
5.14 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a Caa Obligation or CCC Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Fitch Rating and the Moody’s Rating. In most instances, the Fitch Rating and the Moody’s Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation. In most cases, the Moody’s Rating and Fitch Rating in respect of a Collateral Obligation will be based on a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Fitch and/or Moody’s. Such confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or Affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different Rating Agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the Moody’s Rating is derived from an S&P Rating. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See ""Ratings of the Notes"" and ""The Portfolio"".",p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in the applicable financing documentation. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations and Caa Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,
5.15 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,p,
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate ""debtor friendly"" insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.",p,
"The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.",p,
5.16 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed ""lender liability""). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith",p,
"and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called ""equitable subordination"". Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
5.17 Loan Repricing,p,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the Obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an Obligor were upgraded, the Obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such Obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distribution on the Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Class of Notes.",p,
5.18 Collateral Manager,p,
"The Collateral Manager is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See ""The Portfolio"" and ""Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement"". The powers and duties of the Collateral Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a",p,
"Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Risk Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work-outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See ""The Portfolio"". Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time will, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, be limited to a review of readily available public information and, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are bonds which are not publicly listed, any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of bonds and, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are Assignments or Participations of senior and mezzanine loans and in relation to which the Collateral Manager has non-public information, such analysis will include due diligence of the kind common in relation to senior and mezzanine loans of such kind. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Obligations will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of assets.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations, and the Collateral Manager is required to comply with the restrictions contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will not be liable (whether directly or indirectly, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Issuer, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes or any other Person for any loss incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person that arise out of or in connection with the performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties in accordance with the Standard of Care under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, except by (a) by reason of acts or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith, wilful misconduct, wilful default or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance, or reckless disregard, of its obligations under the express terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or (b) by reason of any information provided by the Collateral Manager for inclusion in this Offering Circular containing any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Investors should note that, for such purpose and notwithstanding that the Notes and the Transaction Documents are governed by English law, the interpretation of ""gross negligence"" will be pursuant to New York law. Under New York law, the concept of gross negligence is a significantly lower standard of care than negligence under English law, requiring conduct akin to intentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference under English law. As a result, the Collateral Manager may in some circumstances have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Transaction Documents where it would otherwise have been liable if a mere negligence standard was applied under English law or if New York law was not designated as the law pursuant to which the concept of gross negligence for this purpose would be interpreted.",p,
"The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than entry into the Warehouse Arrangements. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,
"The performance of other collateralised loan obligation vehicles (""CLO Vehicles"") or other similar investment funds or accounts (""Other Funds"") managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer.

"The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.",p,

Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,
5.19 No Placement Agent Role Post-Closing,p,
"The Placement Agent takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Placement Agent or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,
5.20 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations,p,
"The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations during the Initial Investment Period (as defined in the Conditions). The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account during the Initial Investment Period. The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to",p,
"acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.",p,
"Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Equity Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the other Classes of Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
5.21 Valuation Information; Limited Information,p,
"None of the Placement Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee and Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.",p,
5.22 Investment Gains,p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in its discretion, direct that any Investment Gains which would otherwise have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priorities of Payments may (at the election of the Collateral Manager) instead be deposited into the Interest Account, subject to certain conditions. Such Investment Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Interest Priorities of Payments. As a result, such Investment Gains will not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.",p,
6. Irish Law,p,
"The Issuer is subject to risks, including the location of its centre of main interests, the appointment of examiners, claims of preferred creditors and floating charges.",p,
Not a bank deposit,p,
Any investment in the Notes does not have the status of a bank deposit in Ireland and is not within the scope of the deposit protection scheme operated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Issuer is not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland by virtue of the issue of the Notes.,p,
Centre of main interest,p,
"The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the ""Insolvency Regulation"") states that in the case of a company, the place of its registered office shall be presumed to be its centre of main interests (""COMI"") in the absence of proof to the contrary and assuming the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. In the decision by the European Court of Justice (""ECJ"") in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ stated, in relation to the registered office presumption contained in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (which the Insolvency Regulation repealed and replaced), that the place of a company's registered office is presumed to be the company's COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if ""factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect"". As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer's COMI is not located in Ireland, and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, main insolvency proceedings may not be opened in Ireland.",p,
Examinership,p,
"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Irish Companies Act 2014, as amended to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties.",p,
"The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer, are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after his appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his appointment.",p,
"Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets which are the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised he must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to them out of the proceeds of sale.",p,
"During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court or Circuit Court (as applicable) when at least one class of creditors whose interests are impaired under the proposals has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement.",p,
"In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals include a writing down of the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders. The primary risks to the holders of Notes if an examiner were to be appointed in respect of the Issuer are as follows:",p,
(a) the potential for a scheme of arrangement to be approved involving the writing down of the debt owed by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;,p,
(b) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and,p,
"(c) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the secured creditors under the Notes or under any other secured obligations.",p,
Preferred Creditors,p,
"Under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security that may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (that may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) that have been approved by the Irish courts. See ""Examinership"" above.",p,
"The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company (that would include the Issuer) may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those that the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.",p,
"Where notice has been given to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 calendar days of its creation by the holder of the security, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of VAT) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.",p,
"The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax, whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",p,
"In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company that are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.",p,
"The essence of a fixed charge is that the chargor does not have liberty to deal with the assets that are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer, any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.",p,
"In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables, it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the moneys standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.",p,
"Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security purported to be created by the Trust Deed would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.",p,
"Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:",p,
"(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;",p,
"(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up even if crystallised prior to the commencement of the winding-up;",p,
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;,p,
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and,p,
(e) they rank after fixed charges.,p,
7. Conflicts of Interest,p,
"The Placement Agent and the Collateral Manager are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates,p,
"Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise with respect to the Issuer from the overall advisory, investment and other activities of the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates (collectively ""Hayfin Entities"") in the process of providing services to CLO Vehicles and/or other funds (collectively, ""Clients"").",p,
"The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts or their potential consequences. Hayfin Entities sponsor, manage and advise a variety of investment vehicles and each expects to continue to create or sponsor new investment vehicles to develop its investment, advisory and related businesses. Hayfin Entities also engage in a broad range of other investment activities. Hayfin Entities expect that the universe of potential investments and other activities of Hayfin’s business could overlap with the investments and activities of the Fund and, as a result, may create conflicts of interest.",p,
"The Hayfin Entities and their respective Clients may invest in obligations that would be appropriate as Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments. Such investments may be different from those made on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, subject to applicable law and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to invest in Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments the issuers or obligors of which the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates or their respective Clients have financial interests in. The purchase, holding and sale of such investments on behalf of the Issuer may enhance the profitability of the investments of the Collateral Manager or such Affiliates or Clients in such issuers or obligors. The interests of the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates or their respective Clients in such investments may be senior to, pari passu with, junior to, different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations, Eligible Investments or other assets acquired on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
There may be circumstances where the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) wishes to provide financing in relation to an existing or proposed portfolio company in which a controlling shareholder of a Hayfin Entity or a significant investor in funds or managed accounts previously or currently managed by a Hayfin Entity has a material or controlling equity interest. Any such potential conflict of interest will be managed in accordance with Collateral Manager’s significant stakeholder conflicts policy from time to time.,p,
"Separately, due to the nature of the debt and credit markets in which the Issuer invests, there may be situations where (i) the Issuer is involved in the re-financing of debt already held by a predecessor fund or any other fund or managed account managed by a Hayfin Entity or (ii) or any other fund or managed account managed by a Hayfin Entity re-finances debt held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will treat such re-financing on an arms’ length basis and will seek to act in the best interests of all the funds and managed accounts managed or advised by Hayfin Entities.",p,
"Further, there may be circumstances where the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) wishes to provide financing in relation to an existing or proposed portfolio company held by a fund in which another strategy or account managed or advised by a Hayfin Entity. It is not anticipated that a material conflict of interest will arise in this scenario given that such other strategy or account managed or advised by a Hayfin Entity will likely take a passive role in respect of the investments of the underlying fund.",p,
"In the event that any of the situations referenced above arise, the Collateral Manager will manage any potential conflicts of interest in accordance with Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") principles and the relevant provisions of the Transaction Documents (or other investment agreements in the case of other investment vehicles). Any conflicts of interest that arise between the Issuer and the Collateral Manager or other Hayfin Entity clients will be discussed and resolved on a case-by-case basis by business, legal and compliance officers of the Collateral Manager.",p,
"As noted above, Hayfin Entities sponsor and advise a range of investment vehicles and expects to continue to develop its investment and advisory and related businesses. By reason of their responsibilities in connection with other activities, certain employees of Hayfin Entities may acquire material non-public information or other confidential information. Such personnel may not be free to share such information with the Issuer and Noteholders, and the possession of information by persons associated with Collateral Manager may preclude the Collateral Manager from engaging in transactions that it might otherwise have undertaken.",p,
"In addition, funds manages by Hayfin Entities may hold positions in securities or be subject to contractual or legal restraints that could prevent the Collateral Manager from being able to initiate a transaction that it otherwise might have initiated or to sell an investment that it otherwise might have sold. The trading activities of other funds managed by Hayfin Entities may be inconsistent with the investment activities of the Issuer. Furthermore, Hayfin Entities may have or develop business relations through its other businesses which the Collateral Manager may consider in determining whether to undertake a transaction on behalf of the Issuer, with the result that the Issuer may not participate in certain transactions which it might otherwise have participated in.",p,
"Except as expressly prohibited under the Transaction Documents and any other contractual restriction, Hayfin Entities and their associates are permitted to market, organise, sponsor and/or act as general partner, manager, advisor of, or as the primary source for transactions for, third party accounts and other pooled investment vehicles. Hayfin Entities and their associates may also engage in other investment and business activities. Such activities may raise conflicts of interest for which the resolution may not be currently determinable.",p,
"Certain inherent conflicts of interest arise from the fact that: (i) Hayfin Entities may provide investment management services to more than one client; and (ii) clients of Hayfin Entities may have one or more overlapping investment strategies. Also, the investment strategies employed by for current and future clients could conflict with each other, and may affect the prices and availability of the securities and other assets in which such clients invest. If participation in specific investment opportunities is appropriate for more than one client, participation in such opportunities will be allocated pursuant to the Collateral Manager's allocation policies and procedures. There can be no assurance, however, that the application of such allocation policies will result in the allocation of a specific investment opportunity to the Issuer or that the Issuer will participate in all investment opportunities falling within its investment objective. Such considerations may also result in allocations of certain investments among clients’ accounts on other than a pari passu basis.",p,
"In light of its investment objectives for its other business activities, including managing and advising other investment vehicles, there may be occasions when Hayfin Entities hold at the same time investments on account of different investment vehicles in different parts of the capital structure of an investee company, for example senior and mezzanine debt. Neither the Collateral Manager nor any investment vehicle sponsored, managed and/or advised by Hayfin Entities (including the Issuer) will make a material investment in any investee company in which an investment vehicle sponsored, managed and/or advised by Hayfin Entities (including the Issuer) hold an investment in a different class of such investee company’s capital structure unless, at the time of the relevant investment, the relevant Hayfin Entity determines in good faith (but at its absolute discretion) that such investment is suitable for and in the best interests of the relevant investment vehicle.",p,
"Personnel will devote such time as they determine will be necessary to conduct the business affairs of the Issuer in an appropriate manner. However, personnel will work on other projects, including other investments and other existing and potential business activities. The Issuer and the Noteholders will have no interest in such investments or in other investment vehicles marketed, sponsored, managed and/or advised by Hayfin Entities. Conflicts of interest may also arise in the allocation of management and personnel resources amongst various activities.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may at certain times be simultaneously seeking to purchase or dispose of investments on behalf of the Issuer, its other Clients or its Affiliates, including accounts in which the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates, their respective Clients or their respective directors, managers, members, shareholders, partners, officers or employees (each, a ""Collateral Manager Person"" and collectively, ""Collateral Manager Persons"") have a financial interest. Due to the limited supply of certain Collateral Obligations and the differing portfolio characteristics and investment objectives among its Clients, and for other reasons, the Collateral Manager may allocate Collateral Obligations on other than a pro rata basis. The Collateral Manager will act in a manner that it believes to be fair and equitable in allocating investment and trading opportunities, including private placements, among the Issuer and other Clients. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Collateral Manager will consider participation in all appropriate opportunities within the purpose and scope of the Issuer's and each other Client's objectives, and the Collateral Manager will evaluate such factors as it considers relevant in determining whether a particular situation or strategy is suitable and feasible for the Issuer and each other Client (which factors may include the investment restrictions and objectives of the Issuer and each other Client, diversification, covenants and other limitations in the governing agreements, relative size of the Issuer and the Client, available cash, the nature of the opportunity in the context of the Issuer's and the Client's other positions at the time, risk tolerance, liquidity requirements, required credit ratings, duration targets and/or constraints, existing asset allocation targets, minimum investment size, maximum investment size, tax implications, or legal, contractual or regulatory constraints). The Collateral Manager is not obligated to purchase or sell for the Issuer every obligation or security which the Collateral Manager or its employees may purchase or sell for other Clients, if such a transaction or investment appears unsuitable, impractical or undesirable for the Issuer; provided that the Collateral Manager, to the extent within its control, will not favor itself in any way that could reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the Issuer and will act in a manner that over the long term, in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager, will be fair and equitable to the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it should be noted that the Collateral Manager (for a variety of reasons) may allocate trades solely to one Client, on a non-pro rata basis or on a pro rata basis across only those Clients for whom the trade is appropriate based on investment strategy as determined by the Collateral Manager. Conversely, the Collateral Manager may make investments on behalf of the Issuer in Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments that it has declined to invest in for its own account or the account of its other Clients. Records of these accounts and investments will not be made available to Noteholders or the Issuer.",p,
"The Collateral Manager will seek to obtain the best execution in effecting transactions on behalf of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager generally does not seek to invest in obligations or securities for which there is a wide market. The Collateral Manager may therefore be limited in the selection of brokers, dealers or other counterparties to execute transactions on behalf of the Issuer. In situations",p,
"where multiple counterparties can execute a given transaction, the Collateral Manager will seek to obtain best execution for the Issuer, taking into account a number of factors, including the following: the ability to effect prompt and reliable executions at favorable prices (including the applicable dealer spread or commission, if any), the operational efficiency with which transactions are effected, taking into account the size of the order and difficulty of execution, the financial strength, integrity and stability of the broker, the broker's risk in positioning a block of obligations or securities, the broker's capital commitment, confidentiality of the Collateral Manager's accounts, and access to deals or instruments that the Collateral Manager wants to invest in and the competitiveness of commission rates in comparison with other counterparties satisfying the Collateral Manager's other selection criteria.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may, but is not required to, aggregate sales and purchase orders of investments placed with respect to the Collateral Obligations and/or the Eligible Investments with similar orders being made simultaneously for other Clients to achieve more efficient execution or to provide for equitable treatment among accounts, if in the Collateral Manager's reasonable good faith business judgment such aggregation shall not result in an overall economic detriment to the Issuer (taking into consideration, among other things, the sales price, brokerage commission and other expenses). The Issuer and Clients participating in aggregated trades will be allocated obligations or securities and expenses incurred in such transaction based on the average price achieved for such trades. Under some circumstances, such allocation may adversely affect the Issuer with respect to the price or size of the obligations or securities positions saleable.",p,
"The Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates currently serve as manager or adviser or sub-adviser for other Clients that invest in assets of a nature similar to those of the Issuer. The terms of these arrangements, including the fees attributable thereto, may differ significantly from those of the Issuer. In particular, certain investment vehicles and accounts managed by the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates may provide for fees (including performance-based fees) to the Collateral Manager that are higher or lower than the Class M Return Amounts and the Incentive Collateral Management Fees payable by the Issuer in connection with the Notes. As a result, the potential exists for the Collateral Manager to seek to favor one Client over another Client in allocating investment opportunities or otherwise. In particular, the Collateral Manager may have a greater incentive to favor Clients that pay the Collateral Manager (and indirectly its investment personnel) performance-based compensation or otherwise pay higher fees, or in which the Collateral Manager personnel have more significant investments.",p,
"The Collateral Manager will seek to obtain the best execution in effecting transactions on behalf of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager generally does not seek to invest in obligations or securities for which there is a wide market. The Collateral Manager may therefore be limited in the selection of brokers, dealers or other counterparties to execute transactions on behalf of the Issuer.

"The Collateral Manager has advised the Issuer that the Retention Holder will acquire or own the Retention Notes, and one or more Collateral Manager Related Investors may invest in the Notes of one or more Classes of the Issuer from time to time. Such Collateral Manager Related Investors are not required to retain any such Notes (other than the Retention Notes), if purchased. Certain Collateral Manager Related Investors will have the ability to exercise certain voting rights with respect to the Notes. If any Collateral Manager Related Investor purchases the Notes of any Class, the interests of",p,
"such Collateral Manager Related Investor as a Noteholder of such Class may be adverse in some circumstances to the interests of the other holders of such Class. Further, certain amounts payable to the Collateral Manager (the Class M Return Amounts and the Incentive Collateral Management Fee) are payable on a subordinated basis. In providing management services, such factors could create an incentive for the Collateral Manager to seek to maximise the return on the assets so as to increase the amount of payments to it by way of the Class M Return Amounts or the Incentive Collateral Management Fee or as a holder of the Subordinated Notes. As used herein, the term ""Collateral Manager Related Investors"" means the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates, their respective shareholders, members, partners, employees, or any fund or account managed by the Collateral Manager or an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager.",p,
"The Noteholders are expected to include taxable and tax-exempt entities and persons or entities resident of or organised in various jurisdictions. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the Collateral Manager that may be more beneficial for one type of holder of Notes rather than another. In making such decisions, the Collateral Manager intends to consider the investment objectives of the Issuer as a whole, not the investment objectives of any holder individually.",p,
"Additionally, the interests of the holders of the Subordinated Notes may be adverse to those of the holders of the Rated Notes and the Class M Notes. Although the Collateral Manager or Collateral Manager Persons may at times be a holder of the Subordinated Notes, the Class M Notes and/or the Rated Notes, their interests and incentives will not necessarily be aligned with those of either the holders of Subordinated Notes or of the holders of any other particular Class of the Notes.",p,
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person will have no voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of any CM Removal Resolution and/or CM Replacement Resolution (but shall carry a right to vote and be so counted in all matters other than a CM Removal Resolution and/or a CM Replacement Resolution).,p,
"The Collateral Manager is entitled to receive the Incentive Collateral Management Fee, which is dependent to a large extent on the yield earned on the Collateral Obligations. Since the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is payable only after holders of all Classes of Notes are paid in priority, there is an incentive for the Collateral Manager to cause the Issuer to make more speculative investments in Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments than it would otherwise make in order to increase the likelihood that the holders of the Rated Notes and Subordinated Notes receive the required return for the Collateral Manager to be paid such fees. A higher level of defaults on the Collateral Obligations than expected because of speculative investments in Collateral Obligations could have dramatic repercussions on the credit quality of the assets.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may rely on the brokerage, trading, settlement and other capital markets capabilities of its Affiliates in performing its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may agree to permit a portion of any Class M Return Amount or Incentive Collateral Management Fee to be paid to one or more of the Noteholders, any of its other Affiliates or accounts or funds managed by it or its Affiliates or any transferee (which may or may not be a Noteholder). Investors should note that the existence of such fee arrangements may incentivise Noteholders in receipt of such fees to exercise their voting rights in a particular way, including voting against the removal and/or replacement of the Collateral Manager.",p,
Rating Agencies,p,
Fitch and Moody’s have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee,p,
"charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates,p,
,p,
"The Citi Parties will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction and in other roles described below.",p,
"The Citi Parties have been involved (together with the Collateral Manager) in the formulation of the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Priorities of Payments and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. These may be influenced by discussions that the Placement Agent may have or have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes. An Affiliate of the Placement Agent was also a Warehouse Provider under the Warehouse Arrangements.",p,
"The Placement Agent will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Placement Agent in respect of those Notes. The Placement Agent may elect in its sole discretion to rebate a portion of its fees in respect of the Notes to certain investors or the Collateral Manager, including the Retention Holder. The Placement Agent may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Placement Agent expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,
"The Citi Parties may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market. The Citi Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The financial services that the Citi Parties may provide also include providing or arranging financing and, as such, the Citi Parties may have and/or may provide or arrange financing to the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person. The Citi Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Citi Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Citi Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party including, without limitation, in deciding whether to enforce its security granted in connection with any financing. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors Affiliated with the Citi Parties or in which one or more Citi Parties hold an equity participation or other interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Citi Parties' own investments in such Obligors.",p,
From time to time the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Citi Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Citi Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participation interests and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Citi Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of,p,
"collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.",p,
"The Citi Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Citi Parties and employees or customers of the Citi Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to or referencing the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Citi Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Citi Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Citi Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,
"By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.",p,
8. Investment Company Act,p,
"The Issuer has not been and will not be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exemption under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for investment companies (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by ""qualified purchasers"" (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) with respect to the Issuer and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-5 and Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.",p,

Moody’s Ratings,h2,
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.,p,
"Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.",p,
"In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.",p,
Fitch Ratings,h2,
The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Fitch are based upon Fitch’s statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with similar characteristics to the Collateral Obligations and the various eligibility requirements that the Collateral Obligations are required to satisfy.,p,
"Fitch analyses the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default, based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Fitch then determines the level of credit protection necessary based on a specific percentile of the portfolio default distribution determined by the Fitch ""Portfolio Credit Model"" which takes into account the correlation between assets in the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. The results of a statistical analysis are incorporated into a cash flow model built to mimic the structure of the transaction. In this regard, the results of several default scenarios, in conjunction with various qualitative tests (e.g. analysis of the strength of the Collateral Manager), are used to determine the credit enhancement required to support a particular rating.",p,
Fitch’s ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.,p,
"There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by Fitch in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by Fitch.",p,

"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.",p,
Acquisition of Collateral Obligations,h2,
"The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds, during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter (including, but not limited to, Collateral Obligations purchased from the Collateral Manager and those purchased pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements). The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least",p,
"€350,000,000 which is approximately 87.5 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. The proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (including amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations; and (b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes, will be deposited in the First Period Reserve Account and the Unused Proceeds Account on the Issue Date.",p,
The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account during the Initial Investment Period.,p,
"The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests or Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 17 March 2020 (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next following Business Day), subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.",p,
"On or after the Effective Date but prior to the first Payment Date after the Effective Date, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, an amount not exceeding 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount may be transferred to the Interest Account in aggregate and without duplication, from the Principal Account and/or the Unused Proceeds Account, provided that as at such date after giving effect to such transfer, the Collateral Principal Amount equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for such purposes the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and Fitch Collateral Value).",p,
"Within 10 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the ""Effective Date Report"") containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether (i) the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire",p,
"Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date which have not been reinvested shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (x) Moody’s Collateral Value and",p,
"(y) Fitch Collateral Value) and (ii) the Collateral Principal Amount is equal to or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Collateral Principal Amount, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its",p,
"(x) Moody’s Collateral Value and (y) Fitch Collateral Value), and within 15 Business Days following the Effective Date the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide, to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (with a copy to the Collateral Manager, if applicable) confirmation of receipt of an accountants’ certificate recalculating and comparing the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at the Effective Date and the results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests, the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests) and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test by reference to such Collateral Obligations. The accountants’ certificate shall specify the procedures undertaken to review data and re-computations relating to such recalculations.",p,
"The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been given by Moody’s. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies, or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of a Rating Confirmation Plan presented by the Collateral Manager upon request therefor by the Collateral Manager; or (ii) the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied and following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager following the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s is not received, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full (subject, in the case of an Optional Redemption of the Rated Notes in whole, to the right of holders of 100 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of any Class of Rated Notes to elect to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to the holders of such Class of Rated Notes). The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.",p,
"During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations and/or any other intended action which is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.",p,

Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,p,
"The ""Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test"" will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled ""Minimum Diversity Score"" in the applicable Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable ""row/column"" combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between the two rows containing the closest values and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).",p,
"The ""Diversity Score"" is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):",p,
"(a) an ""Average Principal Balance"" is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;",p,
"(b) an ""Obligor Principal Balance"" is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated",p,
as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;,p,
"(c) an ""Equivalent Unit Score"" is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and",p,
(ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;,p,
"(d) an ""Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score"" is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and",p,
"(e) an ""Industry Diversity Score"" is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the ""Diversity Score Table"") for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.",p,
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.,p,

DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT,h2,
The following description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

,p,
General,h2,
"The Collateral Manager will perform certain investment management functions, including, without limitation, supervising and directing the investment and reinvestment of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments, and perform certain administrative and advisory functions on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains procedures whereby the Collateral Manager will have discretionary authority of the Issuer in relation to the composition, acquisition and management of the Portfolio.",p,
Standard of Care of the Collateral Manager,h2,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will agree with the Issuer that it will perform its obligations, duties and discretions under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with reasonable care and in good faith, using a degree of skill and attention no less than that which the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates exercise with respect to comparable assets that they manage for themselves and others and in any event in a manner consistent with practices and procedures followed by institutional managers of international standing relating to assets of the nature and character of the Collateral Obligations (the ""Standard of Care""). To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the Collateral Manager will follow its customary standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
Responsibilities of the Collateral Manager; Indemnities,h2,
"The Collateral Manager and Collateral Manager Related Persons, will not be liable (whether directly or indirectly, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Issuer, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes or any other Person for any liabilities incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person that arise out of or in connection with the performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties in accordance with the Standard of Care under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, except by (a) reason of acts or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance, or reckless disregard, of its obligations under the express terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or (b) by reason of any information provided by the Collateral Manager for inclusion in this Offering Circular containing any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (each a ""Collateral Manager Breach"" and together, ""Collateral Manager Breaches""). In no event will the Collateral Manager be liable for any consequential loss. Other than to the extent resulting from a Collateral Manager Breach, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person and their shareholders, directors, officers, members, attorneys, partners, advisors, agents and employees will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer in relation, inter alia, to the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the incurrence of any liabilities incurred in connection therewith, which will be payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, including, without limitation, any pecuniary sanctions to which the Collateral Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation not arising as a result of a Collateral Manager Breach",p,
(other than when such pecuniary sanctions arise as a result of the Collateral Manager's (simple) negligence or intentional infringement in breaching the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation).,p,
"The Collateral Manager shall indemnify the Issuer and the Trustee in respect of any Collateral Manager Breaches except for any loss incurred by fraud, wilful misconduct or negligence by the Issuer or the Trustee.",p,
Compensation of the Collateral Manager,h2,
"Other than the Incentive Collateral Management Fee (as described below), the Collateral Manager will not be paid a fee by the Issuer for providing its services. As compensation for the performance of its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, on the Issue Date the Collateral Manager (and/or, at its direction, a Collateral Manager Related Person) will subscribe for the Class M Notes. On each Payment Date, a Senior Class M Return Amount and a Subordinated Class M Return Amount shall be payable on the Class M Notes (unless deferred in accordance with Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest or Subordinated Class M Return Amount)). The Senior Class M Return Amount shall be an amount equal to 0.15 per cent. per annum of the Collateral Principal Amount and the Subordinated Class M Return Amount shall be an amount equal to 0.35 per cent. per annum of the Collateral Principal Amount. The Collateral Manager shall retain all Class M Notes it subscribes for on the Issue Date (other than any Class M Notes subscribed for by a Collateral Manager Related Person) and shall not transfer such Class M Notes at any time to any person other than to a successor collateral manager that is appointed following the resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager.",p,
"The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement also provides that the Collateral Manager (and/or, at its discretion, a Collateral Manager Related Person) will be entitled to an Incentive Collateral Management Fee exclusive of any VAT thereon on each Payment Date on which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed, such fee being in an amount equal to and payable from 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In the event that any supply to which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee relates is or becomes subject to VAT payable by the Collateral Manager, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager or the relevant tax authority, as appropriate, in addition to such Incentive Collateral Management Fee against delivery of a valid VAT invoice, provided that the Collateral Manager may agree to bear and not receive amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT).",p,
"Unless otherwise specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or in the Trust Deed, the Collateral Manager shall be responsible for its ordinary rent, office expenses and employee salaries incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Collateral Manager will be paid and reimbursed by the Issuer, for all reasonable costs and expenses whatsoever (but excluding any costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager in connection with the U.S. Retention Regulations) incurred by the Collateral Manager in connection with entering into the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the performance of its obligations thereunder or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed, including, without limitation, any and all of the following, whether incurred by the Collateral Manager before or after the Issue Date, (i) rating agency expenses, (ii) specialty and custom software expenses for the monitoring of the Collateral Obligations, Eligible Investments and other assets of the Issuer, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Collateral Manager and its counsel with respect to the offering and sale of the Notes, (iv) the expenses of employing outside lawyers or consultants in connection with the restructuring of any Collateral Obligation, (v) the fees payable to the Collateral Administrator under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, (vi) the expenses of employing outside",p,
"lawyers to provide advice with respect to Irish law in connection with the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement,",p,
"(vii) the fees and expenses of employing outside lawyers to provide advice with respect to any provisions of the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including any amendment or waiver thereto or hereto, (viii) the reasonable expenses of exercising observation rights (including through a representative) pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, (ix) any data services fees reasonably incurred, (x) reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action taken with respect to the Collateral Obligations, Eligible Investments and other assets of the Issuer (including, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred with respect to potential investments by the Issuer, even if such investment is not made by or on behalf of the Issuer, and brokerage commissions), (xi) preparing reports to holders of the Notes, (xii) reasonable travel expenses (including without limitation airfare, meals, lodging and other transportation) undertaken in connection with the performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, travel expenses incurred in connection with the attendance of the Collateral Manager’s officers and employees at any bank meetings), (xiii) the reasonable costs and expenses in connection with any investor conferences, (xiv) the fees and expenses of employing outside lawyers or consultants in connection with applicable English law, (xv) the fees and expenses incurred in assisting the Issuer with its compliance with EMIR and/or with MAR, (xvi) the reasonable costs and expenses in relation to the provision of any information required by the relevant authorities in connection with CRA3, the Dodd-Frank Act, FATCA and/or CRS and",p,
"(xvii) the reasonable costs and expenses in relation to any research and reports to the extent permissible under MiFID II. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Collateral Manager has documented fees or expenses that are allocable to one or more entities in addition to the Issuer to which the Collateral Manager provides management or advisory services, the Issuer shall be responsible for only a pro rata portion of such fees and expenses, based on the aggregate assets under management of all entities to which such costs or expenses are allocable. All obligations of the Issuer to pay expenses to the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement shall be subject to, and payable only in accordance with, the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"If the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement is terminated or the Collateral Manager resigns or is removed pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or otherwise, the Incentive Collateral Management Fee shall be pro–rated for any partial periods between Payment Dates during which the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement was in effect and shall be due and payable on the first Payment Date following the date of such termination, resignation or removal subject to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
Cross Transactions and Affiliate Transactions,h2,
"The Collateral Manager and its Collateral Manager Related Persons may at certain times seek to purchase or sell investments from or to the Issuer as principal. Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, at its option and sole discretion, may effect principal transactions between such entities. In addition, the Collateral Manager and its Collateral Manager Related Persons will be authorised to engage in certain cross transactions, including ""agency cross"" transactions (i.e. transactions in which either the Collateral Manager or one of its Collateral Manager Related Persons or another person acts as a broker for both the Issuer and another person on the other side of the same transaction, which person may be an account or client for which the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person serves as investment adviser). The Issuer has agreed to permit cross transactions and principal transactions; provided that such consent can be revoked at any time by and to the extent that such consent with respect to any particular cross or principal transaction is required by applicable law. By purchasing a Note, a holder shall be deemed to have consented to the procedures described therein relating to cross transactions and principal transactions. The Collateral Manager or its Collateral Manager Related Persons may receive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities",p,
"regarding, both parties to any such principal transaction or cross transactions. See ""Risk Factors – Conflicts of Interest"".",p,
"The Collateral Manager may also conduct transactions for its own account, for the account of its Collateral Manager Related Persons, for the account of the Issuer or for the accounts of third parties and will endeavour to resolve conflicts arising therefrom in a manner that it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances and applicable law as disclosed under ""Risk Factors – Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates"". Without limiting the foregoing but subject to compliance with the Collateral Manager’s best execution policy and acquisition standards, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of and for the account of the Issuer, may sell Collateral Obligations to, or buy Collateral Obligations from, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, or any fund managed by the Collateral Manager (some or all of which Collateral Manager Related Persons or funds may be owned in part by principals, partners, members, directors, managers, managing directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager) in transactions in which the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or such fund acts as principal on the other side of the transaction from the Issuer and buys or sells the Collateral Obligations for its own account, provided that such affiliate transactions shall be made in accordance with the affiliate transaction procedures set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
Removal for Cause,h2,
"Subject to the paragraph below, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may be terminated, and the Collateral Manager may be removed, for cause upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice by (i) the Issuer at its discretion; or (ii) the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) at the direction of the holders of (A) the Subordinated Notes, acting by Extraordinary Resolution or (B) the Controlling Class, acting by Ordinary Resolution (in each case, excluding any CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes and any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person), provided that notice of such removal shall have been given to the holders of each Class of the Notes and each Hedge Counterparty by the Issuer or the Trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. For purposes of any such termination of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, ""cause"" means any one of the following events:",p,
(a) the Collateral Manager wilfully violates the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party or takes any action that it knows is in material breach of any provision (unrelated to the economic performance of the Collateral Obligations) of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document applicable to the Collateral Manager;,p,
"(b) the Collateral Manager breaches in any respect any material provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement applicable to it (other than as specified in paragraph (a) above) which breach (i) has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or the interests of the Noteholders of any Class and (ii) if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days of the Collateral Manager becoming aware of, or the Collateral Manager receiving notice from the Trustee of, such breach or, if such breach is not capable of cure within 30 days but is capable of being cured within a longer period, the Collateral Manager fails to cure such breach within the period in which a reasonably prudent person could cure such breach (but in no event more than 60 days). Upon becoming aware of any such breach, the Collateral Manager shall give written notice thereof to the Issuer and the Trustee;",p,
"(c) the Collateral Manager is wound up or dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger) or there is appointed over it or a substantial part of its assets a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer; or the Collateral Manager (i) ceases to be able to, or admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts as they",p,
"become due and payable, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of, or enters into any composition or arrangement with, its creditors generally; (ii) applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the appointment of a receiver, administrator, trustee, assignee, custodian, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Collateral Manager or of any substantial part of its properties or assets, or authorises such an application or consent, or proceedings seeking such appointment are commenced against the Collateral Manager in good faith without such authorisation, consent or application and either continue undismissed for 45 days or any such appointment is ordered by a court or regulatory body having jurisdiction; (iii) authorises or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the application of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, readjustment of debt, insolvency, dissolution, or similar law, or authorises such application or consent, or proceedings to such end are instituted against the Collateral Manager in good faith without such authorisation, application or consent and remain undismissed for 45 days or result in adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or the issuance of an order for relief; or (iv) permits or suffers all or any substantial part of its properties or assets to be sequestered or attached by court order and the order remains undismissed for 45 days;",p,
"(d) the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Conditions 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest) or 10(a)(ii) (Non-payment of principal) which default is directly the result of any act or omission of the Collateral Manager resulting from a breach of the Collateral Manager’s duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document, which breach or default is not cured within any applicable cure period set forth in the Conditions;",p,
"(e) any action is taken by the Collateral Manager, or any of its senior executive officers involved in its leveraged investment business, that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or its other collateral management activities, or the Collateral Manager (or any senior officer of the Collateral Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) being found guilty of having committed a criminal offence materially related to the management of investments similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral; or",p,
"(f) any legal, regulatory or other authorisations which are necessary for the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under any applicable laws are not in place or the performance by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents is in breach of any applicable laws, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified, authorised or licensed would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Collateral Manager or on the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under, or on the validity or enforceability of, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, if the Collateral Manager becomes aware that any of the events specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) (inclusive) above have occurred, the Collateral Manager will be required to give prompt written notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the holders of all outstanding Notes and each Rating Agency upon the Collateral Manager becoming aware of the occurrence of such event.",p,
Any such removal is without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention Notes (unless the same are transferred in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (as described herein)).,p,
"The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the payment in full of the Notes, in accordance with their terms, (ii) the",p,
"liquidation of the Portfolio and the final distribution of the proceeds of such liquidation as provided in the Transaction Documents, and (iii) the determination in good faith by the Issuer that the Issuer or the Portfolio has become required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and the Issuer notifies the Collateral Manager thereof.",p,
Resignation,h2,
"The Collateral Manager may resign, upon at least 90 days’ written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and each Rating Agency (or upon such shorter notice as is acceptable to the Issuer). The Collateral Manager may resign its appointment hereunder upon shorter notice whether or not a replacement Collateral Manager has been appointed where there is a change in law or the application of any applicable law which makes it illegal for the Collateral Manager to carry on its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Any such resignation is without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention Notes (unless the same are subsequently transferred in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (as described herein)).",p,
Appointment of Successor,h2,
"Upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager (the date of such removal or resignation, the ""Removal or Resignation Date"") (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Collateral Manager to carry on its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement), the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). The successor collateral manager will be selected by the Issuer as proposed by the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution, provided that the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution do not object within 30 days after the giving of notice thereof in accordance with the Conditions of such proposed selection by the Issuer. If the Controlling Class do object as described in the previous sentence, then the holders of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution must also propose an alternative replacement collateral manager, which shall be appointed as successor provided that the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution do not object within 30 days after the giving of notice thereof in accordance with the Conditions of such proposed selection. If the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution do object as described in the previous sentence, then the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution must also propose an alternative replacement collateral manager, which shall be appointed as successor provided that the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution do not object within 30 days after the giving of notice thereof in accordance with the Conditions of such proposed selection. If the Controlling Class do object as described in the previous sentence, then the Issuer shall appoint a successor collateral manager proposed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution that (i) has not previously been objected to by the holders of the Subordinated Notes, (ii) is not an Affiliate of any such holder voting in favour of such Ordinary Resolution and (iii) otherwise meets the criteria for a successor collateral manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. If no successor collateral manager has been appointed on or before the 180th day following the Removal or Resignation Date or if the Collateral Manager is required to resign or is removed as a result of illegality, the appointment of a successor collateral manager shall be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Trustee (as directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution) and approved by the Collateral Manager, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and the determination of any such arbitrator shall be final. Such successor collateral manager will be required to satisfy the criteria specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, and the appointment will be subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). The",p,
"Collateral Manager shall use its best efforts to transfer all of the Class M Notes it holds to the successor collateral manager on the day on which such successor collateral manager is appointed or if this is not possible, such transfer must occur on the next Business Day. The Retention Notes may be transferred to a successor collateral manager following its appointment as referred to in ""The EU Retention and Transparency Requirements"" below, but the appointment of such successor shall not be conditional upon such a transfer. For the avoidance of doubt, no Notes either held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non- Voting Notes or held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have any voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of any CM Replacement Resolution.",p,
Upon notice of removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager,h2,
"In the event that the Collateral Manager has received notice that it will be removed or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor Collateral Manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, purchases and sales of Collateral Obligations shall be only made in relation to sale of Margin Stock, Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any purchase or sale trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).",p,
"Assignment, Delegation and Transfers",h2,
"The Collateral Manager may not assign or transfer its material rights or delegate material responsibilities under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement without the consent of: (i) the Issuer; (ii) the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution; and (iii) the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution, in each case excluding any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person and any Notes held in the form of CM Removal and Replacement Non-Voting Notes or CM Removal and Replacement Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes, and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and to such transferee, assignee or delegate having the requisite Irish regulatory capacity; provided, that, to the extent permitted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, such consent and Rating Agency Confirmation shall not be required in the case of a Permitted Assignee. A ""Permitted Assignee"", for the purposes of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, means an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager that (i) is legally qualified and has the Irish regulatory capacity to act as Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement; (ii) employs the principal personnel performing the duties required under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement prior to such assignment or transfer; (iii) the appointment of which will not cause either of the Issuer or the Collateral to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act; (iv) the appointment and conduct of which will not cause the Issuer to become chargeable to taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Issuer becoming subject to any additional VAT or similar tax in respective of the provision of collateral management services to it or cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer; and (v) the appointment and conduct of which will not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.",p,

Gross up,p,
"Under each Hedge Agreement the Issuer will not be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments.

Limited Recourse and Non-Petition,p,
The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment); provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).,p,
Termination Provisions,p,

(g) upon the early redemption in full or acceleration of the Notes; and,p,
(h) any other event as specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement.,p,
Hedge Agreements commonly also contain provisions which allow a Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of certain credit events or restructurings related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation.,p,
A termination of a Hedge Agreement or a Hedge Transaction will not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an additional termination event under a Hedge Agreement.,p,
"Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or Termination Event (each as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement), a Hedge Agreement may be terminated by the Hedge Counterparty or the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with the detailed provisions thereof and a lump sum (the ""Termination Payment"") may become payable by the Issuer to the applicable Hedge Counterparty or vice versa. Such Termination Payment will be determined by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and/or Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) by reference to market quotations obtained in respect of the entry into of a replacement swap(s) on the same terms as that terminated or as otherwise described in the applicable Hedge Agreement or, under certain circumstances, any loss suffered by a party.",p,
Rating Downgrade Requirements,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies for the type of derivative transaction represented by the Hedge Transactions in the event that a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies causes the applicable Rating Requirement not to be satisfied. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty (or, if applicable, its guarantor) must provide collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity or procure that a guarantor guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement, in each case in a manner that satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement, or otherwise take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.",p,
Transfer and Modification,p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.",p,
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.,p,
Governing Law,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder, in each case including any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.",p,

It deals with Noteholders who beneficially own their Notes as an investment. Particular rules not discussed below may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding Notes, such as dealers in securities, trusts etc. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and the receipt of interest thereon under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship or domicile.",p,
Taxation of Noteholders Withholding Tax,h2,
"In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.), is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest which should include interest payable on the Notes, as described below under the heading ""Deductibility of Interest"".",p,
The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note so long as interest paid on the relevant Note falls within one of the following categories:,p,
1. Interest paid on a quoted Eurobond,p,
The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note where:,p,
"(a) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds i.e. securities which are issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are listed on a recognised stock exchange (such as the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin) and which carry a right to interest; and",p,
"(b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland, or if such person is in Ireland, either",p,
"(i) the Notes are held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are, amongst others, so recognised); or",p,
(ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the Notes and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland) in the prescribed form; and,p,
(c) one of the following conditions is satisfied:,p,
(i) the Noteholder is resident for tax purposes in Ireland; or,p,
"(ii) the Noteholder is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, premium or other distribution, to a tax in a relevant territory which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory; or",p,
"(iii) the Noteholder is not a company which, directly or indirectly, controls the Issuer, is controlled by the Issuer, or is controlled by a third company which also directly or indirectly controls the Issuer, and neither the Noteholder, nor any person connected with the Noteholder, is a person or persons:",p,
(A) from whom the Issuer has acquired assets;,p,
(B) to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances; or,p,
"(C) with whom the Issuer has entered into a swap agreement,",p,
"(D) where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or swap agreements represents not less than 75 per cent. of the assets of the Issuer; or",p,
"(iv) at the time of issue of the Notes, the Issuer was not in possession, or aware, of any information which could reasonably be taken to indicate that the beneficial owner of the Notes would not be subject to tax in a relevant territory on any interest payments,",p,
where the term:,p,
"relevant territory means a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a country with which Ireland has signed a double tax treaty (""Relevant Territory""); and",p,
"swap agreement means any agreement, arrangement or understanding that—",p,
"(A) provides for the exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of one or more payments based on the value, rate or amount of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof, and",p,
"(B) transfers to a person who is a party to the agreement, arrangement or understanding or to a person connected with that person, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value, rate or amount without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset (including any enterprise or investment pool) or liability that incorporates the financial risk so transferred.",p,
"Thus, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, are held in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c)",p,
"above is met, interest on the Notes can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognised clearing system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside Ireland and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c) above is met.",p,
2. Interest paid by a qualifying company to certain non-residents:,p,
"If, for any reason, the exemption referred to above ceases to apply, interest payments may still be made free of withholding tax provided that:",p,
"2.1 the Issuer remains a ""qualifying company"" as defined in Section 110 of the TCA and the Noteholder is a person which is resident in a Relevant Territory, and, where the recipient is a body corporate, the interest is not paid to it in connection with a trade or business carried on by it in Ireland through a branch or agency. The test of residence is determined by reference to the law of the Relevant Territory in which the Noteholder claims to be resident. The Issuer must be satisfied that the terms of the exemption are satisfied; and",p,
2.2 one of the following conditions is satisfied:,p,
"(a) the Noteholder is a pension fund, government body or other person (which satisfies paragraph (c)(iii) above), which is resident in a Relevant Territory and which, under the laws of that territory, is exempted from tax that corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains in that territory; or",p,
"(b) the interest is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, to a tax in a Relevant Territory which corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory.",p,
Deductibility of Interest,h2,
"Finance Act 2016 amended Section 110 of the TCA by introducing Section 110(5A) which applies to qualifying companies which carry on a business of holding, managing or both holding and managing ""specified mortgages"".",p,
"A ""specified mortgage"" for this purpose is:",p,
"(a) a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, land in Ireland;",p,
"(b) a specified agreement which derives all of its value, or the greater part of its value, directly or indirectly, from land in Ireland or a loan to which paragraph (a) above applies. A specified agreement is defined in Section 110 of the TCA and includes certain derivatives, swaps or similar arrangements. A specified mortgage does not include a specified agreement which derives its value or the greater part of its value from a CLO transaction, a CMBS/RMBS transaction, a loan origination business or a sub-participation transaction (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA);",p,

(d) units in an Irish Real Estate Fund (within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA);,p,
"The holding or managing of ""specified mortgages"" and/or shares that derive the greater part of their value, directly or indirectly, from land in Ireland is defined as a ""specified property business"". Where",p,
"the qualifying company carries on a specified property business in addition to other activities, it must treat the specified property business as a separate business and apportion its expenses on a just and reasonable basis between the separate businesses.",p,
"Where the qualifying company has financed itself with loans carrying interest which is dependent on the results of that company's business or interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return for the use of the principal, or has entered into specified agreements (such as swaps) then the interest or return payable will not be deductible for Irish tax purposes to the extent it exceeds a reasonable commercial return which is not dependent on the results of the qualifying company.",p,
"This restriction is subject to a number of exceptions. Transactions which qualify as ""CLO transactions"" should not be subject to the restrictions described above. A CLO transaction is defined as a securitisation transaction carried out in conformity with:",p,
"(a) a prospectus, within the meaning of Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended) (the ""Prospectus Directive"");",p,
"(b) listing particulars, where any securities issued by the qualifying company are listed on an exchange, other than the main exchange, of Ireland or a relevant EU member state; or",p,

"In this case, on the basis that the Issuer will not acquire ‘specified mortgages’ (as to which, see the Section entitled ""Risk Factors – The Portfolio – ""Eligibility Criteria""), the new rules should not apply to this transaction. The exemption for CLO Transactions should be available to the extent any specified mortgages are acquired.",p,
Encashment Tax,h2,
"Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder.

Taxation of Noteholders,h2,
"Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax, the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish tax with respect to such interest. Noteholders resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland who are individuals may be liable to pay Irish income tax, social insurance (PRSI) contributions and the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.",p,
"Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore may be within the charge to Irish income tax, notwithstanding that the Noteholder is not resident in Ireland. In the case of Noteholders who are non-resident individuals such Noteholders may also be liable to pay the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.",p,
"Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of tax and any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within its scope.",p,

"(ii) under the laws of that territory, where there is no relevant treaty which has the force of law.",p,
Interest on the Notes which does not fall within the above exemptions may be within the charge to Irish income tax.,p,
"Notwithstanding these exemptions from income tax, a corporate recipient that carries on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes are held or attributed may have a liability to Irish corporation tax on the interest.",p,
"In certain limited circumstances, a payment under the Notes, other than a payment equal to the amount subscribed for the Notes, which is considered dependent on the result of the Issuer's business",p,

(b) the Issuer deducts from the payment an amount as interest withholding tax under Section 246(2) of the TCA.,p,
Capital Gains Tax,h2,
"A holder of Notes will not be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of Notes unless (i) such holder is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland or (ii) such holder carries on a trade or business in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes were used or held or (iii) the Notes cease to be listed on a stock exchange in circumstances where the Notes derive their value or more than 50 per cent. of their value from Irish real estate, mineral rights or exploration rights.",p,
Capital Acquisitions Tax,h2,
"A gift or inheritance comprising of Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax (which subject to available exemptions and reliefs, is currently levied at 33 per cent) if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) on the relevant date or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland (i.e. if the Notes are physically located in Ireland or if the register of the Notes is maintained in Ireland).",p,
Stamp Duty,h2,
"No stamp duty or similar tax is imposed in Ireland (on the basis of an exemption provided for in Section 85(2)(c) of the Irish Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999 so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA and the proceeds of the Notes are used in the course of the Issuer’s business), on the issue, transfer or redemption of the Notes.",p,
3. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,p,
General,h2,
"The following discussion summarises certain of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of Notes.",p,
"For purposes of this summary, a ""U.S. Holder"" is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:",p,
" an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States, for U.S. federal income tax purposes;",p,
" a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;",p,
 an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or,p,
" a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions.",p,
"For purposes of this summary, a ""Non-U.S. Holder"" is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:",p,
 a non-resident alien individual for U.S. federal income tax purposes;,p,
 a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;,p,
 an estate whose income is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis; or,p,
 a trust if no court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration or if no United States persons have the authority to control any of its substantial decisions.,p,
"An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for",p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).",p,
"This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes for cash at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes at their issue price (which is the price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was first sold to investors)) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a ""straddle"", ""hedge"", ""synthetic security"" or a ""conversion transaction"" for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as alternative minimum tax consequences or net investment tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; regulated investment companies; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose",p,
"functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax-deferred or tax- advantaged accounts; or ""controlled foreign corporations"" or ""passive foreign investment companies"" for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes.",p,
"In the case of a partnership, or other entity treated as a pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is a beneficial owner of a Note, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership (or other equity holder of such other pass-through entity) will generally depend on the status of such partner (or other equity holder) and upon the activities of such pass-through entity. Partners of partnerships (or other equity holders of other pass-through entities, as applicable) that are beneficial owners of the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.",p,
"PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer,h2,
"United States Federal Income Taxes. The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer intends to conduct its affairs and operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income (including, as a result of the manner in which it acquires, holds and disposes of assets). As a consequence, the Issuer expects that its net income will not become subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. In this regard, upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including certain tax guidelines referenced therein (the ""Tax Guidelines""), and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may not give rise to a default or an Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Tax Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. In this regard, there are no authorities that deal with situations substantially identical to the Issuer’s, and the Issuer could be treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States as a result of unanticipated activities, changes in law, contrary conclusions by the IRS or other causes. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.",p,
"If it were determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such",p,
"U.S. trade or business, the Issuer would be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on such effectively connected taxable income (computed possibly without any allowance",p,
for deductions) and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer will not be subject to,p,
U.S. federal income tax on its net income.,p,
"Representations. Each holder and beneficial owner of a Note that is not a ""United States person"" (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) will make, or by acquiring such Note or an interest therein will be deemed to make, a representation to the effect that (A) either (i) it is not a bank, (ii) it is a person that is eligible for benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that eliminates U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. source interest not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States and received by the Issuer or (iii) all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and (B) it is not purchasing the Note in order to reduce its U.S. federal income tax liability pursuant to a tax avoidance plan within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.881-3.",p,
U.S. Federal Withholding Taxes,h2,
"Although the Issuer does not anticipate that it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its net income, income derived by the Issuer may be subject to withholding or similar taxes imposed by the United States or other countries, and the imposition of such taxes could materially affect its financial ability to make payments on the Notes. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer generally may acquire a particular Collateral Obligation only if, at the time of commitment to purchase, either the interest payments thereon are not subject to withholding tax or the issuer of the Collateral Obligation is required to make ""gross-up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. Accordingly, the Issuer does not generally expect to be subject to U.S. federal withholding taxes on interest from Collateral Obligations. The Issuer may, however, be subject to withholding or similar taxes in respect of commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees, or under FATCA as discussed in more detail below. Any such withholding or similar taxes will not be grossed up.",p,
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that income derived by the Issuer will not become subject to withholding or similar taxes more generally as a result of changes in law, contrary conclusions by the IRS, or other causes. Such withholding or similar taxes could be applied retroactively to fees or other income previously received by the Issuer. To the extent that withholding or similar taxes are imposed and not paid through withholding, the Issuer may be directly liable to the taxing authority to pay such taxes. The imposition of unanticipated withholding or similar taxes could materially impair the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes,h2,
"Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Allen & Overy LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class B-2 Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be received with respect to the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes or the Subordinated Notes. The Issuer intends to treat each Class of the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that any Class of Notes, particularly the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for",p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules relating to U.S. equity owners in PFICs and/or CFCs. See ""Possible Treatment of Rated Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes"" below. Except as",p,
"otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer. The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of such Note agrees or will be deemed to agree to treat such Notes consistently with this treatment.",p,
"The Issuer also intends to treat the Class M Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although this treatment is not entirely clear. Under this treatment, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of acquiring, beneficially owning, and disposing of Class M Notes generally would be the same as the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of acquiring, beneficially owning, and disposing of Subordinated Notes, as described herein. Each holder, by its purchase of a Class M Note, agrees to treat the Class M Notes consistently with this treatment. The balance of this summary does not address the tax consequences to a holder of the Class M Notes. Holders should consult their tax advisers as to the U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences to them of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of the Class M Notes, including the possibility that the Class M Notes could be treated differently from the manner described above.",p,
"This discussion, and the opinion of Allen & Overy LLP described above, do not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes,h2,
"Class X Notes, Class A Notes and Class B Notes",p,
"Stated Interest. U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes will generally include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest accrued or received on their Notes, in accordance with their usual method of tax accounting, as ordinary interest income, subject to the discussions under ""Original Issue Discount"".",p,
"In general, U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the cash method of accounting will calculate the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest based on the euro-to-",p,
U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the time a payment is received.,p,
"In general, U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the accrual method of accounting or that otherwise are required to accrue stated interest before receipt will calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.",p,
"Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of such payments when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",p,
"Original Issue Discount. In addition, if the discount at which a substantial amount of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes is first sold to investors is at least 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of the Class, multiplied by the number of complete years to the weighted average maturity of the Class, then the Issuer will treat the Class as issued with original issue discount (""OID"") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Note within the Class will equal the excess of the principal amount of the Note over its issue price (the price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the Class was first sold to investors). U.S. Holders of Notes that are issued with OID will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders of the Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of the Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.",p,
"If Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply. Moreover, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting generally will be required to include OID in ordinary income no later than the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder takes the OID into account as revenue in an ""applicable financial statement,"" even if the U.S. Holder would otherwise have included the OID in income during a later year under the constant yield method.",p,
"U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes that are issued with OID also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",p,
"Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in its Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by the U.S. dollar value of any amount includable in income as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of payments of principal on such Note (based, in the case of a Class A Note or Class B Note, on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received).",p,
"A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class X Note, Class A Note or Class B Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from",p,
the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.,p,
"Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class X Note, Class A Note or Class B Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement (less any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above) and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.",p,

"Original Issue Discount. The Issuer will treat the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes (the “Deferrable Notes”) as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Deferrable Note will equal the sum of all payments to be received under such Note less its issue price (the price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors). U.S. Holders of the Deferrable Notes will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder can elect to calculate the",p,

Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.",p,
"A U.S. Holder of Deferrable Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Deferrable Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate. It is possible,",p,
"however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Deferrable Notes should apply. Moreover, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting generally will be required to include OID in ordinary income no later than the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder takes the OID into account as revenue in an ""applicable financial statement,"" even if the U.S. Holder would otherwise have included the OID in income during a later year under the constant yield method.",p,
U.S. Holders of Deferrable Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.,p,
"Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder of a Deferrable Note will have a basis in such Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)),",p,

A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Deferrable Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",p,
"Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Deferrable Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long- term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.",p,
Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes as Contingent Payment Debt Instruments,p,

A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.",p,
Possible Treatment of Rated Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes,p,
"As described above under ""U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes"", the Issuer intends to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that any Class of Notes, particularly the Class E Notes and Class F Notes, are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"If any Class of Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer will be a passive foreign investment company (a ""PFIC"") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain on the sale of such Class of Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Holder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by writing ""Protective QEF Election"" on the top of an IRS Form 8621, filling out the form, checking Box A (Election to Treat the PFIC as a QEF) and filing the form with the IRS with respect to their Notes, or by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Holder’s ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a ""qualified electing fund"" (a ""QEF"") and so electing at the appropriate time. Such a U.S. Holder also will be required to file an annual PFIC report. The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to make and maintain a ""protective"" QEF election by no later than 30 June following the end of each of the Issuer’s financial reporting periods. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity, a U.S. Holder of such Notes will also be required to file an annual PFIC report.",p,
"Alternatively, if a Class of Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a controlled foreign corporation (""CFC""), and a U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under ""U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes – Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"" with respect to such Class of Notes.",p,
"A U.S. Holder of any Class of Notes that is treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to reporting requirements, as discussed below under ""U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes"". U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a ""tolling"" of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. Prospective U.S. Holders, particularly U.S. Holders of the Class E Notes or Class F Notes, should read the discussion below regarding the tax treatment of holders of Subordinated Notes and consult with their tax advisors regarding whether to make protective filings of IRS Forms 8621, 926 and 5471 with respect to such Notes and the consequences to them if the Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.",p,

U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes,h2,
"Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. The Issuer will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be subject to the PFIC rules, except for certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC (as described below under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation""). U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should consider making an election to treat the Issuer as a QEF. Generally, a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election on IRS Form 8621, attaching a copy of that form to its U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it held its Subordinated Notes. If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the",p,
"U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. A U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.",p,
"In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute all of its earnings in a taxable year, the electing",p,
"U.S. Holder may also be permitted to elect to defer payment of some or all of the taxes on the QEF’s income, subject to an interest charge (which is non-deductible to individuals) on the deferred amount. In this regard, prospective purchasers of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is expected that the Collateral Obligations will include high-yield debt obligations and such instruments may have substantial OID, the cash payment of which may be deferred, perhaps for a substantial period of time. In addition, the Issuer may use proceeds from the sale of Collateral Obligations to retire other classes of Notes. As a result, in any given year, the Issuer may have substantial amounts of earnings for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are not distributed on the Subordinated Notes. Thus, absent an election to defer payment of taxes, U.S. Holders that make a QEF election with respect to the Issuer may owe tax on significant ""phantom"" income.",p,
"The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the U.S. Holder’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (other than certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC, described below) that does not make a timely QEF election will be required to report the U.S. dollar value of any gain on the disposition of its Subordinated Notes as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, and to compute the tax liability on such gain and any ""Excess Distribution"" (as defined below) received in respect of the Subordinated Notes as if such items had been earned ratably over each day in the U.S. Holder’s holding period (or a certain portion thereof) for the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. Holder will be subject to tax on such gain or Excess Distributions at the highest ordinary income tax rate for each taxable year in which such gain or Excess Distributions are treated as having been earned, other than the current year (for which the U.S. Holder’s regular ordinary income tax rate will apply), regardless of the rate otherwise applicable to the U.S. Holder. Further, such U.S. Holder will also be liable for an interest charge (which is non- deductible to individuals) as if such income tax liabilities had been due with respect to each such year. For purposes of these rules, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganisations and use of the Subordinated Notes as security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions of such Subordinated Notes. In addition, a stepped-up basis in the Subordinated Notes will not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. Holder who has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"Where a QEF election is not timely made by a U.S. Holder for the year in which it acquired its Subordinated Notes, but is made for a later year, the Excess Distribution rules can be avoided for such later year and subsequent years by making an election to recognise gain from a deemed sale of such Notes at the time when the QEF election becomes effective.",p,
"An ""Excess Distribution"" is the amount by which the U.S. dollar value of distributions during a taxable year in respect of a Note exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions in respect thereof during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Note).",p,
"In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made.

"Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Issuer will be a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the equity interests in the Issuer, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by 10 per cent. United States shareholders. For this purpose, a ""10 per cent. United States shareholder"" is any United States person that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of equity in the Issuer. Thus, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes possessing directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Subordinated Notes and Class M Notes collectively would be treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), determined with respect to aggregate voting power or value or aggregate outstanding principal amount, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such 10 per cent. United States shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. If, for any given taxable year, the Issuer is treated as a CFC, a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer will be required to include as ordinary income an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of that person’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ""subpart F income"" at the end of such taxable year. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, ""subpart F income"" includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income.",p,
"If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Holder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the ""qualified portion"" of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Holder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Holder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified portion and has not made a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In that case, the Issuer will again be treated as a PFIC which is not a QEF with respect to the U.S. Holder and the beginning of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will continue to be the date upon which the U.S. Holder acquired Subordinated Notes, unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to recognise gain with respect to the Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer.

"In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly.

"Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under ""Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company"" with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of ""phantom"" income with respect to such interests.",p,
"If a Collateral Obligation is treated as an indirect equity interest in a CFC and a U.S. Holder owns directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the CFC’s voting power or value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Holder generally will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the CFC’s ""subpart F income"" as ordinary income at the end of each taxable year, as described above under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"", regardless of whether the CFC distributed any amounts to the Issuer during such taxable year or whether the U.S. Holder made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held CFC.

"A U.S. Holder that is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"In addition, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes generally will be required to file an annual PFIC report.",p,
"U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a ""tolling"" of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns.",p,
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Subordinated Notes.,p,
Specified Foreign Financial Asset Reporting,p,
"Certain U.S. Holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other ""specified foreign financial assets"" (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds",p,
"$50,000. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.",p,
FBAR Reporting,p,
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Holder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer’s outstanding equity.,p,
Reportable Transactions,p,
"A participant in a ""reportable transaction"" is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders of Notes,h2,
"Subject to the discussions below under ""Information Reporting and Backup Withholding"" and ""FATCA"", payments on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such Non-U.S. Holder is a non resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.",p,
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,h2,
"Under certain circumstances, the Code requires ""information reporting"" annually to the IRS and to each holder, and ""backup withholding"", with respect to certain payments made on or with respect to the Notes. Backup withholding will apply to a U.S. Holder only if the U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its Taxpayer Identification Number (""TIN"") which, for an individual, would be his or her Social Security Number, (ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report payments of interest and dividends, or (iv) under certain circumstances, fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments. The exemption generally is available to U.S. Holders that provide a properly completed IRS Form W-9.",p,
"A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS reporting requirements and",p,
U.S. backup withholding.,p,
"Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of Notes made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries, unless the",p,
payor receives the statement described above or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.,p,
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be refunded (or credited against the holder’s,p,
"U.S. federal income tax liability, if any), provided that certain required information is furnished. The information reporting requirements may apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Copies of the information returns also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.",p,
FATCA,h2,
"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer expects to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations, however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on ""passthru"" payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain ""foreign financial institutions"" that do not comply with FATCA.",p,
"If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and the CRS and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.",p,
Future Legislation and Regulatory Changes Affecting Noteholders,h2,
"Future legislation, regulations, rulings or other authority could affect the federal income tax treatment of the Issuer and Noteholders. The Issuer cannot predict whether and to what extent any such legislative or administrative changes could change the tax consequences to the Issuer and to the Noteholders. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisors regarding possible legislative and administrative changes and their effect on the federal tax treatment of the Issuer and their investment in the Notes.",p,
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.,p,
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,h2,
"ERISA imposes certain requirements on ""employee benefit plans"" subject thereto, on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, ""ERISA Plans""), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.",p,
"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, ""Plans"") and certain persons (referred to as ""parties in interest"" under ERISA or ""disqualified persons"" under the Code (collectively, ""Parties in Interest"")) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.",p,
"Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.",p,
"Under ERISA and the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan invests in an ""equity interest"" of an entity that is neither a ""publicly offered security"" nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an ""operating company"", as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a ""Controlling Person""), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the ""25 per cent. Limitation""). A ""Benefit Plan Investor"" means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.",p,
"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an ""equity interest"" as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. The characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class M Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Class M Notes may, and the Subordinated Notes will likely, be considered ""equity interests"" for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit (or, in the case of Class M Notes, to prohibit) investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes, Class M Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations (deemed and actual) made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (and interests therein) held by a Controlling Person) and to prohibit ownership of Class M Notes by Benefit Plan Investors. Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note (or any interest in any such Note) will be required to make, or will be deemed to have made, certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under ""Transfer Restrictions"" below. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes, Class M Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed) or to the extent they violate the prohibition on ownership of Class M Notes by Benefit Plan Investors. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note (and any interest therein) held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation. In addition, no Benefit Plan Investor will be permitted to hold or acquire any Class M Notes at any time.",p,
"Even assuming the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes are not treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.",p,
"Each of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,
"It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, at 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.",p,

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,h2,
The following description consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Placement Agency Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not otherwise defined herein or in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the terms and conditions of the Notes.,p,
"Citigroup Global Markets Limited (in its capacity as placement agent, the ""Placement Agent"") has agreed with the Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to facilitate the sale of each class of the Notes (the ""Placed Notes"") pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement. The Placement Agency Agreement entitles the Placement Agent to terminate it in certain circumstances prior to payment being made to the Issuer. Each of the Issuer and the Placement Agent may offer the Notes at prices as may be privately negotiated at the time of sale, which may vary among different purchasers and may be different from the issue price of the Notes.",p,

The annual financial statements of the Issuer will be audited. The Issuer will not prepare interim financial statements.",p,
The Trust Deed requires the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee on an annual basis and otherwise promptly on request that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) or other matter which is required to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.,p,

Enforceability of Judgments,h2,
"The Issuer is a designated activity company incorporated under the laws of Ireland. None of the directors and officers of the Issuer are residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United States courts judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States.",p,
"As the United States is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the United States courts is enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the United States courts will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are met:",p,
(a) the United States courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and,p,
"(b) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where, however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.",p,
"However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the United States courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:",p,
(i) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;,p,
(ii) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;,p,
(iii) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice;,p,
(iv) the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain United States laws which will not be enforced in Ireland;,p,
(v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules; or,p,
(vi) there is no practical benefit to the party in whose favour the foreign judgment is made in seeking to have that judgment enforced in Ireland.,p,

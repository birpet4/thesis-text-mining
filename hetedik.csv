VOLCKER RULE,h3,
"Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the ""Volcker Rule"") relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.",p,
"An ""ownership interest"" is broadly defined and may arise through a holder's exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.",p,
"The Issuer may be deemed to be a ""covered fund"" under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. ""banking entities"" and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a ""covered fund"", this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Portfolio Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.",p,
"The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Portfolio Manager and selection of a replacement portfolio manager shall only be exercisable upon a Portfolio Manager Event of Default. The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C",p,
"Notes and the Class D Notes in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer.",p,
"In addition, on 30 January 2020, the five regulators responsible for the enforcement of the Volcker Rule published proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule (the ""Proposed Volcker Changes"") that would, among other things, exclude from the definition of ""ownership interest"" certain senior loans or senior debt interests issued by covered fund. If adopted, the Proposed Volcker Changes may mean that certain of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes would not be considered an ""ownership interest"". This would be the case regardless of whether such holders of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes are held in the form of PM Voting Notes, PM Non- Voting Notes or PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes. There can be no assurances that the Proposed Volcker Changes will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all.",p,
"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule's prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any entity that is a ""banking entity"" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally. Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger, makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future.

RISK FACTORS,h3,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral Obligations securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. The following risk factors are applicable to an investment in the Notes. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the ""Terms and Conditions of the Notes"".",p,
,p,
1. GENERAL COMMERCIAL RISKS,h3,
,p,
1.1 General,p,
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets) with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in ""The Portfolio"". There can be no assurance that the Issuer's investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment) and Condition 11(b) (Enforcement). In particular, (i) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the other Classes of Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager or the Originator or any of their respective Affiliates during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular, the Monthly Reports or the Payment Date Reports, as the case may be.",p,
"In preparing and furnishing the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager and third parties) (and reviewed by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.",p,
"In addition, the information contained in the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will be dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by or on behalf of the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager. The accuracy of the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, and the information included therein, will therefore be subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on behalf of the Portfolio Manager).",p,
1.2 Suitability,h3,
"Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access",p,
"to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,
1.3 Limited Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,h3,
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified and or pre funded and/or secured.",p,
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer's,h3,
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if there are market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,
1.5 General Economic Conditions may Deteriorate and may Affect the Ability of the Issuer to make Payments on the Notes,h3,
"European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the ""Member States""), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.",p,
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.,p,
"As discussed further in 1.7 ""European Union and Euro Zone Risk"", it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"In addition, Obligors of Collateral Obligations may be organised in, or otherwise Domiciled in, certain of such countries currently suffering from economic distress, or other countries that may begin to suffer economic distress, and the uncertainty and market instability in any such country may increase the likelihood of default by such Obligor. If any such Obligor becomes insolvent, by virtue of being organised in such a jurisdiction or having a substantial percentage of its revenues or assets in such a jurisdiction, it may be more likely to be subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in such jurisdiction at the same time as such jurisdiction is itself potentially unstable.",p,
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis and the ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loans arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs may be partially or significantly limited.",p,
"As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. A continuing decreased ability of obligors to obtain refinancing may result in an economic decline causing a deterioration in loan performance generally and defaults of Collateral Obligations. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager acting on behalf of the Portfolio Manager) to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (""CLO"") transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non- performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.",p,
"The global credit crisis and its consequences, together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager acting on behalf of the Portfolio Manager) in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.",p,
"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)) recently emerged in China and has spread to many countries throughout the world, including the US, UK and several other European countries to the extent that the World Health Organisation declared that the outbreak constituted a pandemic. The pandemic has led (and may continue to lead) to disruptions in the economies of regions or nations where the novel coronavirus has arisen (including China, the US and the UK) and may in the future arise. The pandemic has seen a number of regions and countries take steps to impose lockdowns which include restrictions on commercial activity and travel. Such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains, and adversely impacting a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. It is impossible to determine the scope of this pandemic and any future trajectory thereof and the impact of the same on the Notes. This pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy in general, including volatility in or disruption of the credit markets, which could have a material adverse impact on the Issuer and the Issuer's performance and financial results, creditworthiness of the Obligors in respect of the Collateral Obligations, the ability of the Issuer to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations and on the secondary trading market for the Notes. In addition, there can be no assurance that, as a result of deterioration of the creditworthiness of the Obligors and/or the impact on the economies affected by the novel coronavirus, a rating (including any",p,
"proposed Initial Rating assigned to any Class of Rated Notes and/or the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations, such ratings being downgraded prior to the Issue Date) assigned to any of Class of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time and, such rating may be downgraded at any time by the Rating Agencies, the impact of which includes, but is not limited to, the designation of an Effective Date Rating Event.",p,
"1.6 Illiquidity in the Collateralised Debt Obligation, Leveraged Finance and Fixed Income Markets may Affect the Noteholders",h3,
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer's ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer's inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price,",p,
"(ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,h3,
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the ""EFSF"") and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the ""EFSM"") to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe, which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,
"Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the imposition of capital controls, the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.",p,
1.8 Referendum on the UK's EU Membership,h3,
"On 31 January 2020 the UK formally withdrew from the EU following which, and in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (the ""Withdrawal Act""), the UK has entered into a transition period which will last until 31 December 2020. The Withdrawal Act has transported existing EU rules and regulations on to the UK domestic statute book and therefore such EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK during the transition period whilst negotiations with respect to a future relationship between the EU and the UK take place.",p,
"It remains uncertain to what extent the UK and EU will be able to finalise negotiation of a future trading relationship ahead of 31 December 2020. The transition period may be extended once by up to two years. Investors should be aware that the Issuer's risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.",p,
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,
,p,
"It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established following the transition period, or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.",p,
"Upon any agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law may cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of any future agreement, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Regulatory Risk,p,
,p,
"Currently, under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EU and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one jurisdiction in the European Economic Area (""EEA"") or the UK may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries in reliance on passporting rights and without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to whether, following the settlement of a future relationship between the UK and the EU or the EEA (whatever the form thereof), a passporting regime (or similar regime in its effect) will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of any future replacement relationship, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK's future trading agreement will include arrangements for the continuation of a passporting regime (or similar regime in its effect) or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Market Risk,p,
,p,
"Following the results of the referendum with respect to the UK's membership of the EU on 23 June 2016 (the ""Referendum"") and throughout the negotiations between the UK and the EU, the financial markets",p,
"have experienced volatility and disruption and this volatility and disruption is expected to continue until the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU is agreed. As such, investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Investors should be aware that any negotiation between the UK and the EU with respect to their future relationship may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. Such uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Exposure to Counterparties,p,
,p,
"The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that following the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the end of the transition period and depending on the terms of any future relationship between the UK and the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from a failure of the UK to conclude agreed terms with the EU, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see",p,
"4.15 ""Counterparty Risk"" below.",p,
Ratings actions,p,
,p,
"Following the result of the Referendum, S&P and Fitch have each downgraded the UK's sovereign credit rating and each of S&P, Fitch and Moody's has placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.",p,
"The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, such downgrades of the UK's sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.",p,
"While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see 4.15 ""Counterparty Risk"" below.",p,
Currency exchange rates and exchange controls,p,
,p,
"Since the result of the Referendum there has been increased volatility in the currency exchange rates. This volatility is expected to continue until the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU is agreed, and potentially beyond. Investors should note that all payments on the Notes will be denominated in Euros. Investors who are investing in the Notes, but who consider their investment profile and return in another currency may incur a number of risks including those relating to changes in exchange rates (which may be significant). An appreciation in the value of the investor's currency relative to the Euro would result in a decrease of: (i) the investor's currency-equivalent yield on the Notes; (ii) the investor's currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes; and (iii) the investor's currency- equivalent market value of the Notes. See also 4.19 ""Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions",p,
"– Currency Risk"" below.",p,
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,h3,
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company's direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that the Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer's net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Issuer Corporate Services Provider and for payment of the Issuer's other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to those amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests. In addition, service providers who are not paid in full, including the Directors, may have the right to resign. This could ultimately lead to the Issuer being in default under the applicable laws of Ireland and potentially being removed from the Register of Companies and dissolved.",p,
"Further, any award or recourse related thereto would be payable as ""Administrative Expenses"" solely from the Collateral Obligations and all other assets over which the Issuer has granted security to the Trustee for the benefit of holders of the Notes and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the Trust Deed. If distributions on such assets were insufficient to make payments on the Notes and such awards or recourse, no other assets (in particular, no assets of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) would be available for payment of the deficiency. Administrative Expenses of the Issuer are senior (but subject to a cap in most instances) to other amounts owing by the Issuer. If the Issuer were required to pay any such amounts it could reduce or eliminate the ability of the Issuer to make payments to the holders of the Notes.",p,
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES,h3,
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, ""shadow banking entities"" and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis creating the potential for conflict across jurisdictions. Investors should be aware that risks posed by such regulatory overlap and divergence are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes, could be materially and adversely affected thereby.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub- Manager, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences. Certain regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire the Notes, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the Notes who are not subject to those provisions to resell their Notes in the secondary market.",p,
Regulations Affecting Investors,p,
,p,
"All investors whose investment activities are subject to investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities (including the introduction or proposal of risk retention rules) should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Originator and the Portfolio Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory or other framework, including as any such framework applies to any investor's investment in the Notes.",p,
2.1 Basel III,h3,
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (""BCBS"") has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as ""Basel III"") and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio ""backstop"" for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (""LCR"") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (""NSFR"")). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the European Union (being Directive 2009/138/EC including any implementing and/or delegated regulation, technical standards and guidance related thereto as may be amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time).",p,
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Agents, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their affiliates makes any representation or warranty to any such prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
2.2 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements,h3,
EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements,p,
,p,
"The Securitisation Regulation came into force on 1 January 2019 and applies to certain parties involved in the establishment of EU and UK regulated securitisations, the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019, and to certain institutional investors therein. It should be noted that securitisations established prior to the application date of 1 January 2019 which involve the creation of a new securitisation position may also be subject to the Securitisation Regulation. Among other things, the Securitisation Regulation includes provisions harmonising and replacing the risk retention and due diligence requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) applicable to such investors.",p,
"The Securitisation Regulation places a requirement on originators, sponsors and original lenders and securitisation special purpose entities established in the EU and UK (""SSPEs"") to, amongst other things,",p,
(i) retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 per,p,
"cent. and (ii) make certain information available to holders of a securitisation position, competent authorities and (upon request) potential investors in accordance with the transparency requirements set out therein. The Securitisation Regulation also places requirements on an institutional investor intending to invest in an EU or UK regulated securitisation to, amongst other things, (i) be able to demonstrate that such investor has carried out a due diligence assessment in respect of various matters including the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation and its underlying exposures, (ii) verify that the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes to ensure that credit- granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor's creditworthiness, (iii) ensure the originator, sponsor or original lender in respect of the relevant securitisation has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than 5 per cent. in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or asset exposures and (iv) ensure the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available to the investor certain information in accordance with the transparency requirements therein. See 2.4 ""EU Disclosure Requirements"".",p,
"Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties being imposed on the relevant investor, originator, sponsor, lender or SSPE (as applicable), which may be payable or reimbursable pursuant to the Transaction Documents by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses to the extent that pecuniary sanctions are imposed on the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager or the Originator. To the extent that a Portfolio Manager Party is indemnified by the Issuer, the assets of the Issuer will be reduced accordingly and such reduction may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remains unclear (particularly in respect of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, as to which see 2.4 ""EU Disclosure Requirements""). Investors should therefore make themselves aware of such requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Notes.",p,
"Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the Securitisation Regulation. Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Circular to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates nor any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy or otherwise comply with the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, the implementing provisions in respect of the Securitisation Regulation in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements, other than as set out above. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the Securitisation Regulation should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the Securitisation Regulation or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes.",p,
"The Securitisation Regulation and any other changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change (whether as a result of the legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission or otherwise), and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Originator does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention Requirements or in the interpretation thereof.",p,
"See further ""Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives – EU Disclosure Requirements"" and ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements"" below.",p,
U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,
,p,
"On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""U.S. Risk Retention Rules"" ) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a ""sponsor"" of asset-backed securities or its ""majority-owned affiliate"" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralising asset-backed securities (the ""Minimum Risk Retention Requirement"" ).",p,
"On 9 February 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favour of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (the ""LSTA"") in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that managers of so called ""open market CLOs"" are not ""securitizers"" under Section 941 of the Dodd Frank Act, are not subject to risk retention. The transaction described in this Offering Circular would not constitute an ""open market CLO"" for such purposes.",p,
"Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, a ""sponsor"" means a person who organises and initiates a securitisation transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuing entity. A sponsor (or its ""majority-owned affiliate"") is generally prohibited, prior to the end of the sunset period, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing such credit risk by hedging or otherwise transferring the retained credit risk.",p,
"The U.S. Risk Retention Rules provide several permissible forms through which a sponsor (or its ""majority-owned affiliate"") can satisfy the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement, including retaining an eligible vertical interest consisting of not less than 5% of the principal amount of each class of asset- backed securities (""ABS"") issued in a securitisation transaction or retaining an eligible horizontal residual interest consisting of not less than 5% of the fair value of all ABS interests issued in a securitisation transaction, determined using a fair value measurement framework under U.S. GAAP.",p,
"The Originator will purchase an ""eligible horizontal residual interest"" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) on the Issue Date and will retain the ""eligible horizontal residual interest"" as long as required by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See the section of this Offering Circular titled ""U.S. Credit Risk Retention"".",p,
"A ""majority-owned affiliate"" means, among other things, an entity (other than the issuing entity) that is majority controlled by or is under common majority control with the ""sponsor"". For purposes of the definition, majority control means ownership of more than 50 per cent. of the equity of an entity, or ownership of any other controlling financial interest in the entity, as determined under U.S. GAAP. The Portfolio Manager and the Originator are at least 50 per cent. owned by the same ultimate parent entity and therefore the Originator meets the definition of ""majority-owned affiliate"". There can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager will be able to maintain the treatment of the Originator as a ""majority-owned affiliate"", including as a result of a change in GAAP regulations or interpretations over time.",p,
"The failure by the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may result in regulatory actions and other proceedings being brought against the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator, which could result in the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator being required, among other things, to pay damages, transfer interests and/or acquire additional Notes (which may or may not be available at such time for acquisition) or be subject to cease and desist orders or other regulatory action. In addition, a failure to remedy non-compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may also subject the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to adverse publicity and reputational risk resulting from such non-compliance. In addition, given the lack of clarity under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules with respect to the identity of the party responsible for holding the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement upon a removal of the Portfolio Manager, if the applicable Noteholders desire to remove the Portfolio Manager in connection with any such ""cause"" event, there may be no successor Portfolio Manager willing to accept appointment as such, in which case the Portfolio Manager will be required to continue to act as Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. As a result of any of the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may have a material and adverse effect on the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes as well as on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, operations or prospects of the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager.",p,
"The U.S. Risk Retention Rules would apply to any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date or any Refinancing. In addition, the SEC has indicated in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that an ""offer"" and ""sale"" of securities may arise when amendments to securities are so material as to require holders to make an ""investment decision"" with respect to such securities. Thus, if the SEC were to take a similar position with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, they could apply to material amendments to the Trust Deed and the Notes, to the extent such amendments require investors to make a new investment decision with respect to the Notes. There is no assurance that the Notes purchased by the Originator on the Issue Date will be sufficient to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules in connection with any such additional issuance, Refinancing or other material amendment. With respect to the additional issuance of Notes in particular, it is a condition to such additional issuance that the Originator provide its prior written consent thereto. In granting or withholding such consent, it should be expected that the Originator will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Noteholders) and not consent to any of the foregoing actions if to do so might cause the Portfolio Manager to be in violation of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules or to have to increase the amount of Notes held by the Originator. As a result, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may adversely affect the Issuer (and the performance and market value of the Notes) if the Issuer is unable to undertake any such additional issuance, Refinancing or material amendment and may affect the liquidity of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will have any material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Portfolio Manager, the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,
"The statements contained herein regarding the U.S. Risk Retention Rules are based on publicly available information solely as of the date of this Offering Circular. The ultimate interpretation as to whether any action taken by an entity complies with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will be a matter of interpretation by the applicable governmental authorities or regulators. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will not change or be superseded by changes in law. There is no established line of authority, precedent or market practice that provides guidance with respect to compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules in connection with any actions of the Issuer after the rule becomes effective. Moreover, any applicable governmental authority or regulator could provide guidance or state views on compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that materially alter current interpretations or views with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Any changes or further guidance may result in the Portfolio Manager failing to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Notes.",p,
Estimated Fair Values,p,
,p,
"The estimated fair values of the Notes included in the section of this Offering Circular titled ""U.S. Credit Risk Retention"", and the description of inputs and assumptions used to derive such estimated fair values, are forward-looking statements solely for purposes of satisfying the disclosure requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and should not be relied upon by any person for any other purpose, including for purposes of making an investment decision in the Notes or in assessing the value or future value of any of the Notes.",p,
"Specifically, for purposes of disclosures appearing in the section of this Offering Circular titled ""U.S. Credit Risk Retention"" the requirements for valuation set forth in Accounting Standards Codification 820, ""Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"" (""ASC 820""), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP have been applied. Because the Notes will be investments for which there is no, or a limited, liquid market, the fair value of the Notes may not be readily determinable. Accordingly, there is and can be no assurance that the value (or range of values) appearing in such section will accurately reflect the value that will be realised by holders upon the eventual disposition of the Notes.",p,
"Moreover, any value (or range of values) is only an estimate as of the calculation date, which is subject to uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and cannot be controlled. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially the information appearing in such section include the ultimate rating and pricing levels on the Notes, rates and timing of defaults, delinquencies, recoveries and prepayments on the Collateral Obligations, selection and trading of Collateral Obligations by the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on behalf of the Portfolio Manager), ongoing trading gains or losses, changes in interest rates or exchange rates, future reinvestment opportunities and timing of reinvestment, differences between the actual and assumed concentrations of Collateral Obligations, mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds on the Collateral",p,
"Obligations as well as market, financial and/or legal uncertainties. As a result, any such values (or range of values) are not intended to be, and should not be construed in any respect as, a guarantee of value or a statement as to the prices at which the Notes may actually be sold. For various reasons, the price at which Notes might be sold in a specific transaction between specific parties on a specific date may be significantly different than those set forth herein.",p,
"Prospective investors are advised that any information appearing in such section is not intended, and should not be construed, to be investment advice with respect to the merits of any Notes or the transactions described in this Offering Circular, the suitability of investing in any Notes or any investment decision being considered by any prospective investor, or a recommendation to buy or sell any Notes.",p,
2.3 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Portfolio Manager in Order to Comply with Risk Retention,h3,
"The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in 2.2 ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements"" is that ""institutional investors"" as defined in the Securitisation Regulation should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation. The five per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the Collateral Principal Amount. The Originator has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding of not less than 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount.",p,
"Certain discretions of the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements"" section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention Requirements.",p,
"In particular, if, at any time, the deposit of Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency, such Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments will instead be deposited into the Interest Account. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds if the reinvestment of such amount would, in the sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. See",p,
"4.30 ""Recharacterisation of Trading Gains"" below.",p,
"In addition, the Portfolio Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Obligations where such reinvestment would cause a Retention Deficiency. As a result, the Portfolio Manager may be prevented from reinvesting available proceeds in Collateral Obligations in circumstances where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise have been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Also, the Issuer may not issue further Notes without the Originator (a) consenting to such issuance and",p,
(b) to the extent any such issuance would result in non-compliance by the Originator with the EU Retention Requirements.,p,
"As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.",p,
2.4 EU Disclosure Requirements,h3,
"Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation contains transparency requirements that require the originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation to make certain prescribed information relating to the securitisation available to investors, competent authorities and, upon request, to potential investors (the ""Relevant Recipients"").",p,
Required Disclosure,p,
"Virtus Group LP, acting on behalf of the Issuer, has made drafts of the applicable documentation referred to in Articles 7(1)(b) and 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation (the ""Pre-Pricing Draft Documents"") available to the Relevant Recipients before pricing of the Notes via a secure website currently located at http://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by Virtus Group LP to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and the Portfolio Manager from time to time) or by such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as instructed by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf). Investors should note that the Pre-Pricing Draft Documents are subject to change and that on or after the Issue Date, each Pre-Pricing Draft Document will be replaced by the final or signed (as applicable) version of such document.",p,
"Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations to be undertaken by the originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation. This includes quarterly portfolio level disclosure (""Portfolio Reports"") pursuant to Article 7(1)(a) of the Securitisation Regulation, quarterly investor reports containing certain information prescribed by Article 7(1)(e) of the Securitisation Regulation (""Investor Reports"" and together with the Portfolio Reports, the ""Transparency Reports""), any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation EU 596/2014) (""Inside Information"") and any significant events in relation to the securitisation (""Significant Events"").",p,

Any Inside Information and the notification of any Significant Event is required to be made available without delay.",p,
"The Securitisation Regulation provides for ESMA to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information required to be disclosed in respect of underlying exposures and quarterly investor reports. On 22 August 2018, ESMA published its final report (the ""Final Report"") on the technical standards on the disclosure requirements under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation containing detailed draft regulatory technical standards and disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Transparency Reports, Inside Information and Significant Events (the ""Article 7 RTS""). The European Commission has, at the date hereof, not adopted the Final Report, which includes the Article 7 RTS. The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Article 7 RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted the revised Article 7 RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019 and the European Commission adopted and published on 16 October 2019 the final version of the Article 7 RTS. Following the European Commission's adoption, the European Parliament and the Council now have a period of three months in which they may object to or approve the final version of the Article 7 RTS. If the European Parliament and the Council will approve the final version of the Article 7 RTS, it will be subsequently published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force on the 20th calendar day thereafter. The application date of the technical standards has not yet been specified.",p,
"In a statement on 30 November 2018, ESMA confirmed in a joint statement with the other European Supervisory Authorities that, as per the grandfathering provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the reporting obligations, until the regulatory technical standards relating to Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (the ""Article 7 RTS"") are adopted by the European Commission, for the purposes of the Transparency Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the ""CRA3 RTS""). In their current form, the CRA3 RTS only apply to structured finance instruments for which a reporting template has been specified. Currently there is no loan level data template within such Annexes for CLO transactions nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS. On that basis, the Issuer believes that the transaction described herein will not be required to comply with the reporting obligations relating to the Transparency Reports until the Article 7 RTS are adopted and implemented (such date of implementation, the ""Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date""). In any event, information regarding the underlying exposures will be provided prior to the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date in the Payment Date Reports and Monthly Reports, in each case as set out in ""Description of the Reports"" below, which in the Issuer's view is in line with the level of information typically provided to noteholders of European CLO transactions in the period immediately prior to 1 January 2019. In relation to Investor Reports prior to the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date, the CRA3",p,
RTS does not provide a template but rather a list of types of information to be covered. The Issuer intends the Payment Date Report to include information of the types so listed.,p,
"The transaction described herein will have to comply with the reporting obligations relating to the Transparency Reports from the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date. Since there remains significant uncertainty as to the form in which Article 7 RTS will be adopted, it is not clear as to what will be required for compliance. Clarification is being sought by industry participants on these matters.",p,
Reporting Entity,p,
,p,
"The originator, sponsor and SSPE must designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the disclosure requirements (the ""reporting entity"") although all three entities remain liable for the satisfaction of the disclosure requirements. The Issuer shall, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, agree to act as the reporting entity for the transaction described herein.",p,
"Subject to any confidentiality obligations under law, regulation or contract binding upon it, the Portfolio Manager (subject to the Standard of Care under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) shall undertake to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer all reports, data and other information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements. Whether the Issuer will possess or have available to it, or be entitled to receive from the Portfolio Manager as set out in this paragraph, all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the EU Disclosure Requirements is unclear. The Issuer and the Portfolio Manager shall propose to the Collateral Administrator in writing, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the form, content, timing and manner of publication of any such reports and information for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Portfolio Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the competent authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes. Any failure by the Portfolio Manager, the Originator or the Collateral Administrator to fulfil such obligations may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,
"For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Collateral Administrator agrees to provide services on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the fulfilment of the EU Disclosure Requirements, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer's obligations as the entity responsible to fulfil reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements. In providing such information and reporting, neither the Collateral Administrator (nor any other person) assumes any responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use and/or onward disclosure of such information and reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.",p,
"If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the reporting obligations, then investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes. The Issuer, the Originator and the Portfolio Manager may be subject to administrative sanctions in the case of negligence or intentional infringement of the EU Disclosure Requirements, including pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or 10% of total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanctions levied on the Issuer or indemnified by the Issuer to any Portfolio Manager Party or the Originator may materially adversely affect the Issuer's ability to perform its oblig- ations under the Notes and may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. The Issuer shall not be entitled to indemnification by the Portfolio Manager in respect of any such sanction unless the relevant circumstances are caused by a Portfolio Manager Breach. Investors should note that Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation refers to a liability standard of ""negligence and intentional infringement"" whereas the definition of Portfolio Manager Breach refers to a less onerous liability standard of ""bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law)…or reckless or intentional disregard"". Furthermore, the contractual obligation of the Portfolio Manager in respect of the EU Disclosure Requirements pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement is to (subject to the Standard of Care under the",p,
Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator certain information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer of its obligations as the designated reporting entity for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. There is therefore no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager will supply to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator at all or in timely fashion the information required by the Issuer to satisfy the Issuer's obligations in respect of the EU Disclosure Requirements.,p,
"Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Portfolio Manager or the Originator may materially adversely effect the ability of the Portfolio Manager or the Originator (as the case may be) to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. As of the date of this Offering Circular, in respect of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager and the Originator, only the Issuer is established in the European Union and is therefore directly subject to the Securitisation Regulation and the sanctions provisions thereof.",p,

2.5 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),h3,
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (""EMIR"") and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to ""over-the-counter"" (""OTC"") derivative contracts according to whether they are ""financial counterparties"" such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see 2.6 (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are ""non-financial counterparties"" (or third country entities equivalent to ""financial counterparties"" or ""non-financial counterparties"").",p,
"Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) will be subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the ""clearing obligation"") all ""eligible"" OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the ""reporting obligation"") (in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates), and undertake certain risk- mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the ""risk mitigation obligations""). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the ""margin requirement""). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a financial counterparty, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,
"Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its ""group"" (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a ""group"" (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder's holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds, the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,
Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards.,p,
Clearing obligation,p,
,p,
"The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under ""Category 1"") to 21 December 2018 (for non- financial counterparties that are not AIFs grouped under ""Category 4"").",p,
Margin requirements,p,
,p,
"On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the ""RTS""). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.",p,
"The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin. The requirement to post margin has applied since 1 March 2017.",p,
"If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer's ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer's ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Portfolio Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.",p,
"The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See ""Hedging Arrangements"".",p,
"The Conditions allow the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR (including the EMIR Refit Regulation) which may become applicable at a future date.",p,
"Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non- financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Currency Hedge Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer's ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer's ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Portfolio Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own",p,
independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.,p,
EMIR Refit Regulation,p,
,p,
"Regulation (EU) 2019/834 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (the ""EMIR Refit Regulation"") was published in the Official Journal on 28 May 2019 and entered into effect on 17 June 2019. The EMIR Refit Regulation has amended EMIR with respect to the definition of financial counterparties (""FCs""), the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories. The EMIR Refit Regulation has also introduced a new concept of a ""small financial counterparty"" (""SFC"") whereby SFCs shall be exempted from the clearing obligation but are subject to risk mitigation obligations (including collateral exchange). A SFC is a FC whose derivative positions are below the clearing thresholds and therefore will be exempted from the clearing obligation. The EMIR Refit Regulation also includes a material change in the way clearing thresholds are calculated for both FCs and NFCs. Instead of using the 30-day rolling average calculation, the aggregate month-end notional average amount for each of the previous 12 months must be used. In the event that the relevant clearing threshold has been exceeded, the counterparty must begin clearing for: (a) that class of derivatives, if it is an NFC; or (b) all clearing classes of derivatives, if it is an FC. For such purposes, FCs will be required to include all of their OTC derivative contracts or all OTC derivative contracts entered into by other entities within the group, within such calculation.",p,
2.6 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,h3,
"EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (""AIFMD"") regulates alternative investment fund managers (""AIFMs"") and provides in effect that each alternative investment fund (""AIF"") within the scope of the AIFMD must have a designated AIFM responsible for ensuring compliance with the AIFMD. Although there is an exemption in the AIFMD for ""securitisation special purpose entities"" (the ""SSPE Exemption""), the European Securities and Markets Authority has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it, so there can be no certainty as to whether the Issuer would benefit from the SSPE Exemption. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank has confirmed that pending such further clarification from the European Securities and Markets Authority, ""registered financial vehicle corporations"" within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as, or appoint, an AIFM unless the Central Bank issues further guidance advising them to do so.",p,
"If the Issuer is an AIF (which at this stage is unclear) then it would be necessary to identify its AIFM, which would be the entity which manages it in general and is therefore most likely to be the Portfolio Manager. In such a scenario, the Portfolio Manager would be subject to the AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Portfolio Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Portfolio Manager's management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Portfolio Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement as an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. If the Portfolio Manager was to fail to, or be unable to, be appropriately regulated, the Portfolio Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer's assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impair the ability of the Portfolio Manager to manage the Issuer's assets may adversely affect the Portfolio Manager's ability to carry out the Issuer's investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.",p,
"If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as a ""financial counterparty"" under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques",p,
"(including margin posting requirements) with respect to Hedge Transactions entered into after the relevant future effective dates. See also 2.5 ""European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)"" above.",p,
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.",p,
2.7 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,h3,
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Portfolio Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Portfolio Manager and its affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.",p,
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.8 CFTC Regulations,h3,
"Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States (including the CFTC) have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by, among others, (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps and (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,
"Furthermore, regulations requiring the posting of initial and variation margin on uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in the United States on 1 March 2017 for all",p,
"registered swap dealers with respect to variation margin (subject to limited relief) and are being phased in for registered swap dealers between 1 September 2016 and 1 September 2020 with respect to initial margin. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty. While transactions existing prior to the relevant implementation date are not subject to the applicable initial and variation margin requirements, new Hedge Transactions, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty, may be subject to the initial and variation margin requirements, as might existing Hedge Transactions that undergo a material amendment, based on guidance provided and positions taken by United States regulators in other contexts. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post initial or variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.",p,
2.9 Commodity Pool Regulation,h3,
"The Issuer's ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a ""commodity pool"" as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (""CEA"") and the Portfolio Manager to be a ""commodity pool operator"" (""CPO"") and/or a ""commodity trading advisor"" (a ""CTA""), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a ""commodity pool"" to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in ""commodity interests"" which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool"" under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on the Issuer's behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of ""swap"" as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable legal counsel to the effect that none of the Issuer (or its directors or officers), the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator or any of their respective Affiliates or any other person would be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"If trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer's activities falling within the definition of a ""commodity pool"", the Portfolio Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer's assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer's positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer's liquidation value. If the Portfolio Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Portfolio Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Portfolio Manager's ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a ""commodity pool"" under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Portfolio Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on the Issuer's behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Portfolio Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Portfolio Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.",p,
"Further, if the Portfolio Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Portfolio Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer's CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Portfolio Manager",p,
"anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Portfolio Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Portfolio Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the ""NFA"") pass judgement upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related agreement for the placement or purchase of Notes by any Person.",p,
2.10 Volcker Rule,h3,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ""Volcker Rule"") and the corresponding implementing rules prevents ""banking entities"" (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any ""ownership interest"" in, or in ""sponsoring"", a ""covered fund,"" subject to certain exemptions. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain transactions with covered funds.",p,
"An ""ownership interest"" is defined widely and may arise through a holder's exposure to the profits and losses of the ""covered fund"", as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the ""covered fund"". A ""covered fund"" is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the ""ICA"") but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule's implementing regulations.",p,
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.9 ""Commodity Pool Regulation"") could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.",p,
"The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders' rights in respect of the removal of the Portfolio Manager and selection of a replacement Portfolio Manager shall only be exercisable upon an Portfolio Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non- Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as ""ownership interests"" in the Issuer.",p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a ""covered fund"", the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of ""banking entities"" to hold an ""ownership interest"" in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a ""banking entity"" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in ""ownership interests"" of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by ""banking entities"" in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretative guidance of the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to the investor's investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
"In May 2018, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations not relevant to this transaction. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitizations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule's covered fund provisions. It is unclear at this time what changes ultimately will be made to the",p,
"Volcker Rule's implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Portfolio Manager.",p,
"No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a ""covered fund"" for their purposes.",p,
"In addition, on 30 January 2020, the five regulators responsible for the enforcement of the Volcker Rule published proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule (the ""Proposed Volcker Changes"") that would, among other things, exclude from the definition of ""ownership interest"" certain senior loans or senior debt interests issued by covered fund. If adopted, the Proposed Volcker Changes may mean that certain of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes would not be considered an ""ownership interest"". This would be the case regardless of whether such holders of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes are held in the form of PM Voting Notes, PM Non-Voting Notes or PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes. There can be no assurances that the Proposed Volcker Changes will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all.",p,
2.11 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,h3,
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies' risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
2.12 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform,h3,
"The London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") has been reformed, with developments including:",p,
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);,p,
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers' Association in February 2014;,p,
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and,p,
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.,p,
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.,p,
"In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA's intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.",p,
"The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA's intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.",p,
"It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.",p,
"The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, ""EURIBOR""), together with LIBOR, and other so-called ""benchmarks"" are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.",p,
"In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the ""Benchmarks Regulation"") on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU and the UK.",p,
"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to ""administrators"" and also, in some respects, to ""contributors"" and certain ""users"" of ""benchmarks"", and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of ""benchmarks"" provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU and UK. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called ""critical benchmark"" indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including ""proprietary"" indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated ""critical benchmarks"" for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017 respectively.",p,
"Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.",p,
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):,p,
"(a) an index which is a ""benchmark"" could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and",p,
"(b) the methodology or other terms of the ""benchmark"" could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.",p,
Investors should be aware that:,p,
"(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of ""benchmarks"" could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a ""benchmark"" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain ""benchmarks"", trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain ""benchmarks"" or lead to the disappearance of certain ""benchmarks"";",p,
"(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:,p,
"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,
"(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;",p,
"(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fallback mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, if a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented as provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and",p,
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Notes.,p,
"Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes.",p,
2.13 Financial Transaction Tax,h3,
"On 14 February 2013, the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft directive (the ""Commission's Proposal"") for a financial transaction tax (""FTT"") to be adopted in certain participating Member States (including Belgium, Germany, Estonia (although Estonia has since stated that it will not participate), Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia). If the Commission's Proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on ""financial institutions"" (which would include the Issuer) in relation to ""financial transactions"" (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments).",p,
"Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ""established"" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or",p,
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the financial transaction is issued in a participating Member State.,p,
"The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Issuer with respect to certain transactions if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Any such tax liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and may result in investors receiving less interest and/or principal than expected. To the extent that such liabilities may arise at a time when winding up proceedings have been commenced in respect of the Issuer, such liabilities may be regarded as an expense of the liquidation and, as such, be payable out of the floating charge assets of the Issuer (and its general estate) in priority to the claims of Noteholders and other secured creditors. It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions",p,
by investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.,p,
"However, the Commission's Proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. additional Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.",p,
"2.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures",h3,
"The Uniting and Strengthening America By Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the ""USA PATRIOT Act""), signed into law on and effective as of 26 October 2001, requires that financial institutions, a term that includes banks, broker-dealers and investment companies, establish and maintain compliance programs to guard against money laundering activities. The USA PATRIOT Act requires the Treasury to prescribe regulations in connection with anti-money laundering policies of financial institutions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (""FinCEN""), an agency of the Treasury, has announced that it is likely that such regulations would require pooled investment vehicles such as the Issuer to enact anti-money laundering policies.",p,
"Many other jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively with the USA PATRIOT Act, the ""AML Requirements""). Any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Trustee or the Agents or any of their respective Affiliates could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. The AML Requirements could require the Issuer to implement additional restrictions on the transfer of the Notes.",p,
"The Issuer reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a Noteholder and the source of the payment of subscription monies, or as is necessary to comply with any customer identification programs required by FinCEN and/or the SEC or any other applicable AML Requirements. If there is a delay or failure by the applicant to produce any information required for verification purposes, an application for or transfer of Notes and the subscription monies relating thereto may be refused.",p,
2.15 CRA3,h3,
"Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (""CRA3"") came into force on 20 June 2013. Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.",p,
2.16 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,h3,
"At a meeting in Paris on 29 May 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") Council at Ministerial Level adopted a declaration on base erosion and profit shifting urging the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs to develop an action plan to address base erosion and profit",p,
"shifting in a comprehensive manner. In July 2013, the OECD launched an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (""BEPS""), identifying fifteen specific actions to achieve this. Subsequently, the OECD published discussion papers and held public consultations in relation to those actions, also publishing interim reports, analyses and sets of recommendations in September 2014 for seven of the actions. On 5 October 2015, the OECD published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan, which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the ""Final Report""). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,
The focus of one of the actions from this project (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances.,p,
"Whether the Issuer is subject to United Kingdom corporation tax by virtue of the activities of the Portfolio Sub-Manager may depend on whether it can benefit from Articles 5 and 8 of the UK-Ireland double tax treaty. Further, the Issuer may rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by Ireland to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply.",p,
"The OECD recommendations on Action 6 are primarily being implemented into double tax treaties through a multilateral convention. The multilateral convention has been signed by over 75 jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom and Ireland). It entered into force on 1 July 2018 for signatories who deposited their ratification, acceptance or approval on or before 22 March 2018. For signatories who deposited or deposit their ratification, acceptance or approval after 22 March 2018, the multilateral convention comes into force at the start of the month which is three entire calendar months after such deposit takes place. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification on 29 June 2018 and therefore the multilateral convention came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification on 29 January 2019 and therefore the multilateral convention came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019. The date from which provisions of the multilateral convention have effect in relation to a treaty depends on several factors including the type of tax which the relevant treaty article relates to.",p,
"Upon ratifying the multilateral convention each of the United Kingdom and Ireland deposited a non- provisional list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the multilateral convention, Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions which have ratified the multilateral convention, by the inclusion of a principal purpose test (""PPT"").",p,
"Once in effect, a PPT could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is currently unclear how a PPT, if adopted, would be applied by the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which payments are made to the Issuer or the United Kingdom in relation to the application of Articles 5 and 8 of the UK-Ireland double tax treaty. It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to their double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefit of these treaties.",p,
"In particular, it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to the UK-Ireland double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties as a result of the adoption of the PPT under Action 6) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland's network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business, tax and financial position.",p,
2.17 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2,h3,
"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the ""Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive""). Member States had until 2019 to",p,
"implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.",p,
"Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that ""exceeding borrowing costs"" in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. ""Exceeding borrowing costs"" is a defined term which relates to the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed ""interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets"". Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving Member States and third countries (the ""Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2""). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires Member States to either deny deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 was required to be implemented in the Member States' national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and was required to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.",p,
"The Irish Finance Act 2019 includes legislation dealing with hybrid mismatches which came into effect on 1 January 2020. The implementation date for the interest limitation provision in Ireland is yet to be announced. Accordingly, the final form and impact of the interest limitation rule in Ireland remains uncertain.",p,
2.18 Taxation Implications of Reinvestment Amounts,h3,
"A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts). Subordinated Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Reinvestment Amount. Subordinated Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment to them of making a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts).",p,
2.19 Diverted Profits Tax,h3,
"The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the ""diverted profits tax"" which is charged at 25 per cent. of any ""taxable diverted profits"". The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident company's trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.",p,
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.,p,
"Should the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager be assessed to diverted profits tax, it will in certain circumstances be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the Interest",p,
"Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that H.M. Revenue & Customs would be entitled to seek to assess the Issuer to any diverted profits tax due directly rather than through the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager as its UK tax representative. Should the Issuer be assessed directly on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay such amounts in accordance with Interest Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments, or (save for following the enforcement of security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the Trust Deed) the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable.",p,
"If the United Kingdom imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Collateral Tax Event. If a Collateral Tax Event were to occur the Rated Notes may be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole",p,
"- Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) in whole but not in part at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, or the Originator.",p,
2.20 Value Added Tax treatment of the Portfolio Management Fees,h3,
,p,
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish domestic law, the Portfolio Management Fees should be exempt from VAT. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a ""qualifying company"" as defined in section 110 of the TCA.",p,
"This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the ""VAT Directive""), which provides that Member States shall exempt from VAT the management of ""special investment funds"" as defined by Member States.",p,
"Historically, a similar position has been taken by The Netherlands, however recent developments have changed this and the approach of the Dutch tax authorities currently is that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in The Netherlands. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a ""special investment fund"". The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities (""UCITS"") as defined in EU Directive 2009/65/EC could only qualify as ""special investment funds"" if they are ""subject to specific State supervision"" because only ""investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors"" as UCITS.",p,
"Partly in response to the Fiscale Eenheid X case, the European Commission has asked the VAT Committee (an advisory body comprising representatives from tax authorities of all of the Member States and chaired by a representative from the European Commission) to shed light on the types of entities that can also qualify as ""special investment funds"". A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a ""special investment fund"" if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.",p,
"The views expressed by the VAT Committee are merely advisory and do not necessarily have the agreement of the European Commission. Furthermore, its views are not legally binding and the courts may disagree with them. There is nevertheless a risk that the European Commission will accept the views of the VAT Committee and will conclude that entities such as the Issuer cannot qualify as a ""special investment funds"" because they are either not subject to the right sort of regulatory supervision in Ireland and/or because they do not target the same circle of investors as UCITS.",p,
"Member States have a degree of discretion on how to define ""special investment funds"", and therefore there are some discrepancies amongst Member States on the meaning of the term. The Fiscale Eenheid X case was about how broad that discretion is. The application of the VAT exemption for ""special investment funds"" could now be reviewed at a Member State level and/or by the European Commission to ensure that the definitions used are within the ambit of discretion permitted by the VAT Directive.",p,
"The Issuer is not aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management paid by entities such as the Issuer. However, it is possible that some Member States (including Ireland) could change their domestic VAT laws, or the European Commission could require them to do so. If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Portfolio Management Fees. The standard VAT rate in Ireland is currently 23 per cent. It is also possible that Ireland could be required to recover the benefit of the VAT exemption obtained before the date on which the law changes from the Issuer together with interest.",p,
"The imposition of VAT in Ireland on the Portfolio Management Fees will not constitute a Note Tax Event or a Collateral Tax Event. Accordingly, Noteholders will not become entitled to redeem the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) or Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) as a consequence thereof. Furthermore, it may not be possible to substitute the Issuer with another company that is incorporated in another jurisdiction within the European Economic Area that does not charge VAT on CLO collateral management and administration fees.",p,
2.21 The Common Reporting Standard,h3,
"The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the ""CRS""). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) (""FIs"") relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.",p,
"Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (""DAC II"") implements the CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other Member States on an annual basis.",p,
Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS and the CRS (and DAC II) have been implemented into Irish law.,p,
"Over 100 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 49 countries, including Ireland, and all other Member States (known as the ""Early Adopter Group"" ) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.",p,
"The Irish Revenue Commissioners issued regulations to implement the requirements of the CRS and DAC II into Irish law under which Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) are obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons' tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.",p,
The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer's (or any nominated service provider's) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the,p,
"Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance, (iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.",p,
2.22 Regulated Banking Activity,h3,
"In many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities ""in"" certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, ""Regulated Banking Activities"") is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer's ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.23 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,h3,
"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the ""BRRD"") equips national authorities in Member States (the ""Resolution Authorities"") with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, ""relevant institutions""). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution's failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of ""bail-in"" powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to ""bail-in"" the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.",p,
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (""Stay Regulations""), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (""SRRs"") vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (""PRA"") has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA's policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to ""stays"" under SRRs.",p,
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the ""SRB"") and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the ""SRM Regulation""). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,
2.24 Centre of Main Interests,h3,
"The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ""Recast EU Insolvency Regulation""), the Issuer's centre of main interest (""COMI"") is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.",p,
"As the Issuer's COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute ""proof to the contrary"" regarding the location of a company's COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that ""factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties"" would be needed to demonstrate that a company's actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company's COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.",p,
"As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer's COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.",p,
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES,h3,
,p,
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,
"Currently, no market exists for the Notes. The Sole Arranger and Initial Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) may make a market for the Notes but is not under any obligation to do so, and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time without notice. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop, or if a secondary market does",p,
"develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or will continue for the life of the Notes. Over the past few years, notes issued in securitisation transactions have experienced historically high volatility and significant fluctuations in market value. Additionally, some potential buyers of such notes now view securitisation products as an inappropriate investment, thereby reducing the number of potential buyers and/or potentially affecting liquidity in the secondary market. Noteholders must therefore be prepared to hold their Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See ""Plan of Distribution"" and ""Transfer Restrictions"". Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,
"In addition, PM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into PM Voting Notes or PM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for PM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the PM Non-Voting Notes and the PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.",p,
"3.2 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty or the Trustee.",h3,
"None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub- Manager, the Originator, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty, the Trustee or any Affiliate thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any Noteholder of ownership of the Notes, and no Noteholder may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each Noteholder will be required to represent (or, in the case of certain non-certificated Notes, deemed to represent) to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger and the Initial Purchaser, among other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is within its powers and authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly authorised by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.",p,
3.3 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,h3,
"The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
3.4 The Notes are Subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class,h3,
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:,p,
"(a) on any Business Day after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, either (x) at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (y) at the direction in writing of the Originator (subject to the ability of the Subordinated Noteholders to object to such redemption directed by the Originator acting by way of Ordinary Resolution);",p,
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of,p,
(x) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution or (y) the Originator; or,p,
"(c) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event and the satisfaction of certain conditions at the direction of (x) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (y) the Originator,",p,
"in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Portfolio Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).",p,
,p,
"In addition, any Reset Amendment (including any amendment to the Transaction Documents that would otherwise have required an Extraordinary Resolution of the relevant Class or Classes of Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution) were it not made at the same time as a Refinancing of all Classes of Rated Notes in whole) may be approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Subordinated Noteholders. See Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution).",p,
"As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions and the consent of the Portfolio Manager, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing). It should be noted that a Refinancing or the issuance of additional Notes will result in the application of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. As such, the ability of the Issuer and the Noteholders to issue additional notes or enter into a Refinancing may be impacted. See 2.2 ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - U.S. Risk Retention Rules"".",p,
"Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes should note that their ability to direct or elect for optional redemption of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part by Class) in certain of the above circumstances is subject to the consent of the Portfolio Manager at the time, which consent may be withheld in the Portfolio Manager's sole discretion.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,
"The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Portfolio Manager.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager or the Originator may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.",p,
"If there is an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes or, in certain circumstances, that losses would not be incurred on the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Portfolio Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.",p,
"Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing. In addition, a Refinancing may result in a Class of Rated Notes having a shorter maturity date than other Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.7 ""Refinancing"".",p,
3.5 The Notes are Subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Portfolio Manager,h3,
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion provides written certification to the Trustee (on which the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) that it (A) has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days using commercially reasonable endeavours, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional or Substitute Collateral Obligations or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, has determined, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, that a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.6 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes,h3,
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the holders of the Rated Notes or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests) and Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event).",p,
,p,
3.7 Refinancing,h3,
"Following a Refinancing in part pursuant to the Conditions, a Class of Refinancing Obligation may in certain circumstances have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of the Classes of Notes ranking lower than such Refinancing Obligations in the Priorities of Payment. This could result in the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) being required to sell Collateral Obligations or use Principal Proceeds which could have been used for reinvestment to redeem such maturing Class of Notes. This could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
3.8 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early,h3,
"The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Portfolio Manager notifies the Issuer, the Rating Agencies and the Trustee that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.",p,
3.9 The Portfolio Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period,h3,
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. See ""The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period"" below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,
3.10 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and/or a Note Event of Default,h3,
Additional Issuances,p,
,p,
"At any time during the Reinvestment Period with respect to the Rated Notes and from time to time with respect to the Subordinated Notes, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Originator, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer's issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) apply such net proceeds as Interest Proceeds pursuant to the Interest Priority of Payments or for other Permitted Uses. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,
Redirection of Funds to Reinvestment,p,
,p,
"The Portfolio Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds (including by deferring, designating for reinvestment or waiving payment of some or all of its Portfolio Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses.",p,
Portfolio Manager Advances,p,
,p,
"The Portfolio Manager may make Portfolio Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(m) (Portfolio Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Portfolio Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Each Portfolio Manager Advance shall not be less than €1,000,000 and may accrue interest at a rate of up to EURIBOR (as determined in respect of the Notes from time to time pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest), subject to a minimum of zero) plus 2.00 per cent. per annum.",p,
Reinvestment Amounts,p,
,p,
"Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts) by contributing assets to the Issuer either directly or indirectly by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will decide in its sole discretion (but subject always to compliance with its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement including the ""Standard of Care"" as defined therein) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.",p,
"Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see 3.19 ""Average Life and Prepayment Considerations"").",p,
3.11 Additional Issuances of Subordinated Notes not subject to Anti-Dilution Rights,h3,
"The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including that the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. However, this requirement does not apply to any additional issuance of Subordinated Notes if such issuance is required in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency for any reason. Accordingly, the proportion of Subordinated Notes held by a Subordinated Noteholder may be diluted following an additional issuance of Subordinated Notes. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,
,p,
3.12 Limited Recourse Obligations,h3,
"The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Originator, the Trustee, the Corporate Services Provider, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer's Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Originator, the Trustee, the Issuer, the Corporate Services Provider, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Reinvesting Noteholders (if any); (c) thirdly, the Class F Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class E Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class D Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class C Noteholders; (g) seventhly, the Class B Noteholders; and (h) lastly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders, the Trustee or any other Secured Party (or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, examinership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer. These limited recourse provisions shall survive the termination of the Notes.",p,
3.13 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,h3,
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer's bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation",p,
pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer's assets.,p,
3.14 Subordination of the Notes,h3,
"Except as described below, the Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes, and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.",p,
"The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full, subject to and as more fully described in the Priorities of Payment. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account (or to repay principal on the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence) if the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"Non-payment of any Interest Amounts due and payable in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or 10 Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of or has actual knowledge of such error or omission). In such circumstances, the Class A Noteholders (or following redemption in full of the Class A Notes, the Class B Noteholders), acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default). However, non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes on any Payment Date will not constitute a Note Event of Default, even if such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class.",p,
"If any acceleration of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes occurs the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the",p,
"conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of: (i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders and (vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class which is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes, provided that such action is consistent with the applicable law and with all other provisions of the Trust Deed. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).",p,
3.15 Calculation of Rate of Interest,h3,
"If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any related rate of interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the related rate of interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, none of the Portfolio Manager, any Agent or the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis and shall suffer no liability to any Noteholder for any adverse effects or losses incurred as a result.",p,
"Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes (if there is a material disruption to, change in the methodology of calculating of or cessation of EURIBOR, or the Portfolio Manager reasonably expects any of the foregoing will occur) without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented as provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).",p,
3.16 Amount and Timing of Payments,h3,
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be a Note Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,
"As described above, failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, even where such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class, will not be a Note Event of Default. Holders of such Classes of Notes will consequently have no right to accelerate their Notes or to direct that the Trustee take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral to recover the principal amount of their Notes outstanding in such circumstances.",p,
"Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
3.17 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited,h3,
"The Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports and, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to provide reporting in this regard, the Investor Reports and the Portfolio Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Portfolio Manager. Noteholders may access these reports by way of a unique password obtained from the Collateral Administrator (or as may otherwise be permitted by the Portfolio Manager). In preparing and furnishing these reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Portfolio Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, recompute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,
3.18 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,h3,
"A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency's opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Rated Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Rated Notes and the market value of such Rated Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Rated Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, Noteholders may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer's ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral Obligations (including by restricting the ability of the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer to undertake discretionary sales of Collateral Obligations or reinvest Sale Proceeds and/or Unscheduled",p,
"Principal Proceeds in Substitute Collateral Obligations following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, in each case due to the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period following a downgrade or withdrawal of ratings in relation to certain of the Rated Notes). See ""The Portfolio"" and ""Ratings of the Notes"".",p,
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Rating Agencies may refuse to give Rating Agency Confirmations,p,
,p,
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by Noteholders.",p,
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in Withdrawal of Ratings if Certain Actions are not Taken by the Issuer,p,
,p,
"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the ""arranger"" (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,",p,
"(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the ""arranger"" is the Issuer.",p,
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger's certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (""Unsolicited Ratings"") which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and",p,
"market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes. The Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee and each of their respective Affiliates are not obliged to take any action following the publication or announcement of any such Unsolicited Ratings.",p,
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.,p,
Actions of any Rating Agency can Adversely Affect the Market Value or Liquidity of the Notes,p,
,p,
"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of ""due diligence services"" for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant's agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager, and portions of this report may constitute ""due diligence services"" under Rule 17g-10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute ""due diligence services"" under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,
3.19 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,h3,
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is 22 January 2033 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the Obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.",p,
"3.20 Projections, Forecasts and Estimates are Forward Looking Statements and are Inherently Uncertain",h3,
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes (including in connection with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules), are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will",p,
"vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,
3.21 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,h3,
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders' opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority. Furthermore, if a Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any creditors' rights against the Issuer and will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the Trust Deed. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to the holders of subordinated Classes of Notes and in particular, the Subordinated Notes, following any liquidation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds from the Collateral to pay senior Classes of Notes and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the Issuer.",p,
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes, or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations, instead being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes or paid into the Principal Account for the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations until such tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.6 ""Mandatory Redemption of the Notes"".",p,
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,
3.22 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,h3,
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.",p,
3.23 Withholding Tax on the Notes,h3,
"So long as the Notes remain listed on the Global Exchange Market or another stock exchange which is a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA, Irish withholding tax should not be imposed on payments on the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 9 (Taxation), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts",p,
otherwise distributable to a holder if required to do so by law (including FATCA) or by any relevant taxation authority.,p,
"If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,
"If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax (other than in circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, the imposition of withholding tax in respect of FATCA) or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or the Originator, subject to certain conditions.",p,
3.24 Book-entry Holders are not Considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed and may Delay Receipt of Payments on the Notes,h3,
"Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.",p,
"Noteholders owning a book-entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See ""Form of the Notes"".",p,
3.25 Security,h3,
Clearing Systems,p,
,p,
"Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (""DTC""), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer's ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities if the Custodian or its sub-custodian becomes insolvent.",p,
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect",p,
"in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party or any of their respective Affiliates.",p,
Fixed Security,p,
,p,
"Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
"3.26 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",h3,
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution or, in the case of a decision in relation to the removal of the Portfolio Manager, following the occurrence of a Portfolio Manager Event of Default (other than pursuant to paragraph (vii) of the definition thereof), by way of PM Removal Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.",p,
"Any Notes (including Rated Notes and Subordinated Notes) held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person, shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution.",p,
"If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. The voting threshold at any Noteholders' meeting in respect of an Ordinary Resolution, an Extraordinary Resolution or a PM Removal Resolution is, respectively, more than 50 per cent., at least 66⅔ per cent. or at least 75 per cent. of the votes cast on such Resolution. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution, PM Removal Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of (i) a PM Removal Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount",p,

Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution.

"If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, give notice to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following a Note Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) of the definition thereof, such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.",p,
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith), would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; or otherwise (B) (1) in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in Condition 10(a)(i), (ii) or (iv) (Note Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to such Note Event of Default; or (2) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes (acting independently and each by way of Extraordinary Resolution) directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action.",p,
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the,p,

Imposition of Tax on Non-U.S. Noteholders,p,

However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Noteholders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.",p,
U.S. Trade or Business,p,
,p,
"Although the Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a ""United States real property interest"" or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to a Note Event of Default and a Portfolio Manager Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer's ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
FATCA,p,
,p,
"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Additionally under existing U.S. Treasury Regulations, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of U.S. Collateral Obligations was to take effect on 1 January 2019; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, which may be currently relied upon, would eliminate FATCA withholding on such types of payments. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain Noteholders to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on ""passthru"" payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain ""foreign financial institutions"" that do not comply with FATCA.",p,
"If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder's ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder's Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.",p,
The Issuer is expected to be treated as a passive foreign investment company and may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation,p,

"The Issuer is expected to be a passive foreign investment company (""PFIC"") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which means that a U.S. Noteholder (as defined in ""Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation"") of Subordinated Notes (and any other Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be subject to adverse tax consequences, unless such U.S. Holder elects to treat the Issuer as a qualified electing fund (""QEF"") and to recognise currently its proportionate share of the Issuer's income whether or not distributed to such U.S. Noteholder. In addition, depending on the overall ownership of interests in the Issuer, a U.S. Holder of 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or 10 per cent. or more of the combined value of the Subordinated Notes (and any other Classes of Notes",p,
"treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be treated as a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder (as defined in ""Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation – U.S. Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes – Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"") in a controlled foreign corporation (""CFC"") and required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the ""subpart F income"" of the Issuer, whether or not distributed to such U.S. Noteholder. A U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election, or that is required to include subpart F income in the event that the Issuer is treated as a CFC, may recognise income in amounts significantly greater than the payments received from the Issuer. Taxable income may exceed cash payments when, for example, the Issuer uses earnings to repay principal on the Notes or accrues income on the Collateral Obligations prior to the receipt of cash or the Issuer discharges its debt at a discount. A U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election or that is required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the subpart F income of the Issuer will be required to include in current income its pro rata share of such earnings, income or amounts whether or not the Issuer actually makes any payments to such U.S. Noteholder. The Issuer will cause its independent accountants to supply U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes, at such U.S. Noteholder's request and at the Issuer's expense, with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Noteholder reasonably requests to satisfy filing requirements with respect to making a QEF election and to satisfy filing requirements under the CFC rules.",p,
Possible treatment of the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes,p,
,p,
"The Class E Notes and Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note or Class F Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Noteholders (as defined in ""Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation"") may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective QEF election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.

3.32 Flip Clauses,h3,
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (""flip clauses""), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor's insolvency breaches the ""anti-deprivation"" principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor's position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code's safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck",p,
"acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision ""directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts"". While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty's automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is ""flipped"" or modified upon, for example, such counterparty's default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code's safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer's ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,
3.33 UK Taxation of the Issuer,h3,
"In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.",p,
"As the Issuer is incorporated in Ireland, the Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.",p,
"The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer's behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Portfolio Manager and the Portfolio Sub-Manager will, however, have and are expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Portfolio Manager and Portfolio Sub-Manager carry out on its behalf provided that the Issuer's activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.,p,
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Portfolio Sub- Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK taxation if the specific domestic UK tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non- resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the ""Investment Manager Exemption"") is available in the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available if the Portfolio Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK taxation if the exemption in Article 8(1) of the UK-Ireland tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub- Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK-Ireland tax treaty.",p,
"Should the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Portfolio Sub-Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"If the United Kingdom imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Collateral Tax Event. If a Collateral Tax Event were to occur the Rated Notes may be redeemed in accordance with 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) in whole but not in part at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, or at the written direction of the Originator. The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a ""trade of dealing in or developing UK land"", (b) it disposes of ""interests in UK land"" or certain assets other than ""interests in UK land"" which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a ""substantial indirect interest"" in that land, or (c) it carries on a ""UK property business "" or has other ""UK property income"".

This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgement and ability of the Portfolio Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"Neither the Issuer, the Sole Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their respective Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, (other than in the case of Participations) become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Portfolio Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.",p,
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,h3,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Unsecured Senior Loans and/or Unsecured Senior Bonds), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds as well as certain other investments lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non- Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See ""The Portfolio"".",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be",p,
"adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Portfolio Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor's participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger, or the Initial Purchaser would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder's Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Portfolio Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Obligations. Except for a right to approve purchases under the Warehouse Arrangements as described below, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.",p,
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date,h3,
,p,
"On behalf of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations (each, a ""Warehoused Asset"", and collectively, ""Warehoused Assets"") during the period prior to the Issue Date (such period, the ""Warehouse Period"") pursuant to a financing arrangement (the ""Warehouse Arrangements"") between, amongst others, the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (as ""Senior Lender"") and certain third party investors (such third party investors, the ""Warehouse Investors"") with respect to such purchases. The Warehouse Arrangements will be terminated on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Senior Lender and the Warehouse Investors in connection with such arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
"Under the Warehouse Arrangements, the Senior Lender and Warehouse Investors provided, and will provide prior to the Issue Date, financing to the Issuer. Such funds were used by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) for the acquisition of the Warehoused Assets (provided that the Senior Lender approves the purchase of any such Warehoused Assets). The approval by the Senior Lender of the purchase of any Warehoused Assets will be in its capacity as financing party and should not be viewed as a determination by the Senior Lender or any Affiliate thereof as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether it will satisfy the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer. If the Senior Lender does not approve the purchase of any Warehoused Assets, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) may be restricted from purchasing",p,
"that asset for a certain period, which may result in the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) paying a higher price.",p,
"The Warehouse Investors have, during the Warehouse Period, provided the junior funding to the Issuer. Certain of the Warehouse Investors may, but are not required to, purchase Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. If the Issue Date occurs, any unrealised losses or gains resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets, will be for the account of the Issuer. If the Issue Date does not occur, the Warehouse Investors and the Senior Lender will bear the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets. The interests of the Senior Lender and the Warehouse Investors in respect of the Warehoused Assets will not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.",p,
"The prices paid for such Collateral Obligations will be the prevailing prices at the time of the execution of such trades and in market circumstances applicable at that time, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer's control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date.",p,
"In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Investors on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during such period, provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Investors and the Senior Lender.",p,
"The financing provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date by applying part of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes. Certain costs and expenses related to the Warehouse Arrangements, including the interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the Warehouse Arrangements and payment of certain fees and reimbursement of certain expenses to such lender and any agents appointed in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, will, therefore, be borne by the Issuer as such amounts will be paid by application of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
4.4 Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period,h3,
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy, as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests. See ""The Portfolio"". The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Portfolio Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. See also 2.5 ""European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)"".",p,
"To the extent it is not possible to, or the Portfolio Manager does not, purchase such additional Collateral Obligations or enter into Currency Hedge Transactions, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as",p,
"it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to, acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
"Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Portfolio Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
4.5 The Target Par Amount,h3,
"As of the Effective Date, the Issuer is required to have acquired, or entered into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, (a) any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and (b) the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (i) S&P Collateral Value and (ii) Fitch Collateral Value), subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. If the Target Par Amount has not been reached on the Effective Date an Effective Date Rating Event may occur pursuant to the Conditions which may in certain circumstances lead to an early redemption of the Notes.",p,
4.6 Prepayment Risk,h3,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made. The rate of prepayments, amortisation and defaults may be influenced by various factors including:",p,
 changes in Obligor performance and requirements for capital;,p,
 the level of interest rates;,p,
 lack of credit being extended and/or the tightening of credit underwriting standards in the commercial lending industry; and,p,
" the overall economic environment, including any fluctuations in the recovery from the current economic conditions.",p,
"The Issuer cannot predict the actual rate of prepayments, accelerated amortisation or defaults which will be experienced with respect to the Collateral Obligations. As a result, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for any investor that requires a regular or predictable schedule of principal payments.",p,
Bonds frequently have call or redemption features (with or without a premium or make whole) that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date.,p,
"Repayments on bonds may be caused by a variety of factors which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such repayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a repayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and may be acquired in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by holders of the Notes and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
4.7 Defaults and Recoveries,h3,
"The Collateral Obligations will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in non-investment grade loans and bonds, which are subject to liquidity, market value, credit, interest rate, reinvestment and certain other risks. It is anticipated that the Collateral Obligations generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade corporate obligations. These risks could be exacerbated to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in one or more particular types of Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Prices of the Collateral Obligations may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, prevailing credit spreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The current uncertainty affecting the European economy and the economies of countries in which issuers of the Collateral Obligations are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the value and performance of the Collateral Obligations. Additionally, loans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organised exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customised, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the debt securities market.",p,
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans",p,
and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.,p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors (including any such analysis prepared by the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser for or at the direction of investors) in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,
"In some European jurisdictions (including the UK), obligors or lenders may seek a ""scheme of arrangement"". In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms.",p,
"Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See 4.24 ""Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations"".",p,
It is a requirement of the rating of the Rated Notes that Collateral Obligations that are to constitute Restructured Obligations following a restructuring satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria on the applicable Restructuring Date. Such requirement may result in Collateral Obligations ceasing to be Collateral Obligations following a restructuring of the terms thereof.,p,
4.8 Underlying Portfolio,h3,
"Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations in aggregate (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor's creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior",p,
"Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical senior loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor's shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at 4.18 ""Interest Rate Risk"".",p,
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
"Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan.",p,
"However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
,p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading",p,
"volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to their debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.",p,
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,
,p,
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
,p,
"The Issuer or the Portfolio Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
,p,
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for High Yield Bonds.",p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such",p,
"studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.",p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers' ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by Obligors with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.24 ""Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations"". It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both",p,
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.,p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Transaction Documents, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or",p,
"priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the Obligor. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) ""debtor-in-possession"" financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law,p,
,p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer's liens on an Obligor's underlying collateral and impair the Issuer's recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer's interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer's lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer's lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer's interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Loans,p,
,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Loans. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loans occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,
4.9 Corporate Rescue Loans,h3,
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer's original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer's more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer's ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan may be unsecured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it may have a lien or the priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,
4.10 Bridge Loans,h3,
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 3.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to,p,
"refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.",p,
4.11 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,h3,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or out of a Portfolio Manager Advance. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time (on any particular Payment Date up to a maximum of three Payment Dates) which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment may not on a cumulative basis exceed €9,000,000 in respect of all Payment Dates.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account may also or alternatively be used to fund the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations. There can therefore be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.",p,
"To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Portfolio Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Portfolio Manager may, at its discretion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, a ""Portfolio Manager Advance"") to such account pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. All such Portfolio Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
4.12 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,h3,
,p,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer's rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected",p,
maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.,p,
"4.13 Participations, Novations and Assignments",h3,
"The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a ""Selling Institution"". Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as ""Assignments"". Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as ""Participations"".",p,
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the Obligor all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the Obligor. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the Obligor and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the Obligor once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the Obligor. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution's portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the Obligor under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the Obligor. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the Obligor and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. If the Selling Institution selling a Participation becomes insolvent or similar, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the Obligor and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the Obligor sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the Obligor. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by an Obligor. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institution may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.",p,
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the ""bail-in"" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See",p,
"2.23 ""EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive"".",p,
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount,p,
of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.,p,
4.14 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,h3,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
4.15 Counterparty Risk,h3,
"Assignments, Participations, and Hedge Transactions, involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will generally be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.",p,
"Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the ""bail-in"" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See 2.23 ""EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive"".",p,
4.16 Concentration Risk,h3,
"Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would",p,
"subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See ""The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests"". Although the resulting diversification of Collateral may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.",p,
4.17 Credit Risk,h3,
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,
4.18 Interest Rate Risk,h3,
"The Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. The Class B-2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.",p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain.",p,
"As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, floating rate basis mismatch, maturity date mismatch and/or mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR or LIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such interest rate hedge is a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in paragraph 2.9 ""Commodity Pool Regulation"". However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer's exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See ""Hedging Arrangements"".",p,
"If a significant number of Collateral Obligations pay interest on a semi-annual basis there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (""Interest Smoothing""). In",p,
"addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of ""Frequency Switch Event"". There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and reset risks, respectively. Furthermore, the Portfolio Profile Tests permit up to 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount to comprise Annual Obligations (being Collateral Obligations which, in accordance with their terms, pay interest less frequently than semi-annually).",p,
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank's or other central bank's deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer's behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable, in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,
"To the extent that the European Central Bank's or other central bank's deposit rate from time to time results in obligors in respect of financial instruments held by the Issuer as Eligible Investments incurring negative deposit rates as a result of having issued such instruments and whilst such instruments remain outstanding, the Issuer (as holder of such instruments) may also be required to compensate the relevant obligors for such chargeable interest incurred in the form of a mandatory reduction in the principal amount outstanding of such instruments in accordance with their terms.",p,
4.19 Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions – Currency Risk,h3,
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 20.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations.,p,
"Subject to satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Manager may, on behalf of the Issuer, acquire Non-Euro Obligations provided that a Currency Hedge Transaction is entered into in respect of each such Non-Euro Obligation with one or more Currency Hedge Counterparties satisfying the applicable Rating Requirement under which the currency risk is reduced or eliminated, no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non-Euro Obligation. Under each Currency Hedge Transaction, the currency risk arising from the receipt of certain cash flows from the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, including interest and principal payments thereon, are hedged. The Currency Hedge Transaction shall terminate on the maturity date of the Non-Euro Obligation and in the other circumstances specified therein.",p,
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations may be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). The Portfolio Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Portfolio Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. Furthermore, the terms of a relevant Hedge Agreement may provide for the ability of a Currency Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer",p,
"has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See 2.5 ""European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)"", 2.8 ""CFTC Regulations"" and 2.9 ""Commodity Pool Regulation"".",p,
"The Issuer's ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes. In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial up-front payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.",p,
"The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,
"The principal amount and coupon of any Non-Euro Obligation may, to the extent the related Currency Hedge Transaction terminates, subject to varying levels of haircuts in accordance with the Transaction Documents.",p,
4.20 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,h3,
"To the extent the Issuer maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Portfolio Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Portfolio Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds see 3.9 ""The Portfolio Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period"". The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Portfolio Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Portfolio. Any decrease in the yield of the Portfolio will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that if the Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale,p,
"Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
4.21 Rising Interest Rates may Render some Obligors Unable to pay Interest on their Collateral Obligations,h3,
"Most of the Collateral Obligations will bear interest at floating interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by the related Obligors will also increase. As prevailing interest rates increase, some Obligors may not be able to make the increased interest payments on Collateral Obligations or refinance their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligations, resulting in payment defaults, Defaulted Obligations and an inability of the Issuer to make payment on some or all Classes of Notes. Conversely if interest rates decline, Obligors may refinance their Collateral Obligations at lower interest rates which could affect the average life of the Notes.",p,
4.22 Balloon Obligations and Bullet Obligations Present Refinancing Risk,h3,
"The Collateral may consist of Collateral Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligation on a timely basis or at all.",p,
4.23 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,h3,
"Credit ratings of Collateral Obligations represent the rating agencies' opinions regarding their credit quality but are not a guarantee of such quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Obligations and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a credit rating assigned to any Collateral Obligation is lowered",p,
"for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor's current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Obligations that the Issuer holds from time will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward.",p,
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a Fitch CCC Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating. In some instances, the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Fitch or S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Portfolio Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Portfolio Manager. Such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. Please see ""Ratings of the Notes"" and ""The Portfolio"".",p,
,p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised as at the date of this Offering Circular despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Fitch CCC Obligations and S&P CCC Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests))) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
4.24 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,h3,
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors' abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate ""debtor friendly"" insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes if the relevant Obligor becomes insolvent.",p,
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.,p,
4.25 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,h3,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed ""lender liability""). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Portfolio Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called ""equitable subordination"". Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Portfolio Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"Because Affiliates of, or Persons related to, the Portfolio Manager may hold equity or other interests in Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the Issuer could be exposed to claims for equitable subordination or lender liability or both based on such equity or other holdings.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
4.26 Loan Repricing,h3,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,
4.27 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,h3,
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction",p,
"(other than U.S. withholding tax on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can, upon the completion of the relevant procedural formalities be sheltered by application being made under a double tax treaty or otherwise, (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make ""gross up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax or (iii) such withholding tax is imposed under FATCA as a result of the Issuer being unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA due to (X) a holder or beneficial owner of a Note failing to provide the required information to comply with FATCA or otherwise causing the Issuer to be unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA or (Y) a change in law. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the Obligor or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator).",p,
4.28 Portfolio Manager,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager is given authority in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement to act as Portfolio Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. See ""The Portfolio"" and ""Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement"". The powers and duties of the Portfolio Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Risk Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work- outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See ""The Portfolio"". Any analysis by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time (i) in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, may be limited to a review of readily available public information (ii) and in respect of Collateral Obligations which are loans or bonds which are not publicly listed, will be in accordance with practices deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer). Any analysis by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Obligations will also be in accordance with practices deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer).",p,
"In addition, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Portfolio Manager's ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.",p,
"Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager will not be liable for any losses, costs, liabilities or claims incurred as a result of the acts or omissions by the Portfolio Manager Parties under or in connection with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement except by reason of (i) acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of, or reckless or intentional disregard with respect to, the duties of the Portfolio Manager thereunder (provided that a decline in the market value of any Collateral Obligation will not, by itself, constitute wilful misconduct",p,
"or gross negligence by the Portfolio Manager) or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Portfolio Manager Information (including any amendment or supplement thereto contained in any amendment or supplement to this Offering Circular approved in writing by the Portfolio Manager) or any omission to state in the sections of this Offering Circular titled ""Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)"", ""Description of the Portfolio Manager"", ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – The Originator"", ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations"", ""U.S. Credit Risk Retention"", ""Description of the Portfolio Sub-Manager"", ""Description of the Portfolio Sub-Management Agreement"" and the fifth paragraph of ""Risk Factors – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules"" (together, the ""Portfolio Manager Information""), a material fact, in each case necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The matters described in (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred to as ""Portfolio Manager Breaches"" and each individually is a ""Portfolio Manager Breach"". Investors should note that the concept of ""gross negligence"" (with such term given its meaning under New York law) may be interpreted by an English court as implying a significantly lower required standard of care on the part of the Portfolio Manager than ordinary negligence under English law. As a result, the Portfolio Manager may have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement where it would otherwise have been liable for failing to reach the required standard of care if a mere ordinary negligence standard under English law were applied under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or if New York law was not designated as the law pursuant to which the concept of gross negligence for this purpose would be interpreted.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the ""Portfolio Manager Parties"") will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including any pecuniary sanctions to which the Portfolio Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation not arising as a result of any act or omission that constitutes a Portfolio Manager Breach) which will be payable as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, and the Issuer will be entitled to indemnification by the Portfolio Manager as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.

"The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than in respect of (i) the Warehouse Arrangements and (ii) the entry into binding commitments to purchase certain Collateral Obligations from the Originator and certain dealers. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Portfolio Manager. The nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer's future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Portfolio Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer's investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,

Although the Portfolio Manager and the Portfolio Sub-Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the operations of the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager to perform their duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,
4.29 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing,h3,
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer and has no authority to advise the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates acts as Hedge Counterparty or owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity. While the Initial Purchaser may own a portion of certain Classes of Rated Notes on the Issue Date and may own Notes at any time, it has no obligation to make any investment in any Notes and may sell at any time any Notes it does purchase. See also 5 ""Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates"".",p,
4.30 Recharacterisation of Trading Gains,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager may direct that all or part of any Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments are instead deposited into the Interest Account if (a) such amounts would, in its sole discretion, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency or (b) the conditions in Condition 3(l)(ii)(P) (Interest Account) are satisfied, in the discretion of the Portfolio Manager.",p,
"Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. As a result, such Trading Gains would not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations. See Conditions 3(l)(ii)(O) (Interest Account) and 3(l)(ii)(P) (Interest Account).",p,
4.31 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations,h3,
"The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals at least €225,000,000 (representing 90 per cent. of the Target Par Amount). The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations during the Initial Investment Period. The Portfolio Manager's decisions",p,
"concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Portfolio Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes. There is no assurance that the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria, as applicable.",p,
"The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date.

"Under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on its behalf) may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Equity Security, an Exchanged Equity Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Portfolio Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Portfolio Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Issuer may not acquire (whether during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period or thereafter) or dispose of any Collateral Obligation (during the Reinvestment Period) unless either (i) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such acquisition or disposal, or (ii) in connection with an acquisition following which the Originator Requirement would not be met, such Collateral Obligation is acquired from the Originator pursuant to the Collateral Acquisition Agreements, in each case unless and to the extent that the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply.",p,

"Furthermore, the requirement to satisfy the Originator Requirement (unless and to the extent that the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply) may have an effect on the ability of the Issuer (and the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) to identify and acquire appropriate Collateral Obligations either during the Initial Investment Period (see further 4.4 ""Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period"") or for reinvestment (see further 4.20 ""Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances"").",p,

5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Initial Purchaser and their respective affiliates are acting in a number of capacities, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest.

The scope of the activities of the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates and the funds and other clients they advise may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager and its clients and Affiliates may buy Notes, from which the Portfolio Manager or such clients or Affiliates may derive revenues and profits in addition to the fees disclosed herein.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager is entitled to the Senior Management Fee, the Subordinated Management Fee and in certain circumstances, the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee, subject to the Priorities of Payment as described herein and the availability of funds therefor. By reason of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee, the Portfolio Manager may have a conflict between its obligation to manage the Issuer's portfolio prudently and the financial incentive created by such fees for the Portfolio Manager to make investments that are riskier or more aggressive than would be the case in the absence of such fees. See ""The Incentive Portfolio Management Fee may create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations"" below.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates, any of their respective clients, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors or employees, or funds or other investment accounts managed by the Portfolio Manager or any of its Affiliates (""Related Entities"") may engage in transactions with, provide services to, invest in, advise, sponsor and/or act as investment manager to investment vehicles and other persons or entities that may have similar structures and investment objectives and policies to those of the Issuer and that may compete with the Issuer for investment opportunities. The Portfolio Manager acts as an investment manager to the Originator and @Onex. The Portfolio Manager and such Related Entities may receive fees or other benefits for these services or investments even though the Portfolio Manager is not receiving any fee or is receiving lower fees or benefits for its services to the Issuer. This disparity in fee income may create potential conflicts of interest between the Portfolio Manager's obligations to the Issuer and such Related Entities' obligations to other persons for such services. A majority of the Collateral Obligations identified by the Portfolio Manager for purchase by the Issuer has been or will be purchased from the Originator, which is an Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager (see ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements""). In addition, the Portfolio Manager will delegate to the Portfolio Sub-Manager certain duties of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Such delegation shall be made pursuant to the Portfolio Sub-Management",p,

Failure to comply with the requirements imposed on the Portfolio Manager as a consequence of its current registrations or requirements that may be imposed as a result of future registrations may have a significant adverse effect on the Portfolio Manager's ability to perform its duties to the Issuer.

The Related Entities may also have or establish relationships with companies whose debt obligations are Collateral Obligations and may now or in the future own or seek to acquire equity securities or debt obligations issued by issuers of Collateral Obligations, and such equity securities or debt obligations may have interests different from or adverse to the debt obligations that are Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Related Entities may serve as a general partner and/or manager of limited partnerships or other entities organised to issue notes or certificates, similar to the Notes, which are secured by high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments, or may manage third party accounts which invest in high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments. The Related Entities may also provide other advisory services for a customary fee to issuers whose debt obligations or other securities are Collateral Obligations, and neither the holders of the Notes nor the Issuer shall have any right to such fees. Certain of the Related Entities may be companies that are controlled by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation, or their respective Affiliates, or an account, fund, client or portfolio established and controlled by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation or their respective Affiliates (""Portfolio Companies"") that are issuers of debt obligations or other securities that satisfy the standards for Collateral Obligations, but such debt obligations or other securities will not be purchased by the Issuer. In connection with the foregoing activities, the Portfolio Manager and/or other Related Entities may from time to time come into possession of material nonpublic information that limits the ability of the Portfolio Manager to effect a transaction for the Issuer, and the Issuer's investments may be constrained as a consequence of the Portfolio Manager's inability to use such information for advisory",p,
"purposes or otherwise to effect transactions that otherwise may have been initiated on behalf of its clients, including the Issuer.",p,
"Furthermore, the Portfolio Manager's ability to advise the Issuer to buy debt obligations for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell debt obligations which are part of the Portfolio may be restricted by limitations contained in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Issuer may be unable to buy or sell debt obligations or to take other actions that the Portfolio Manager might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the holders of the Notes. The Portfolio Manager and any of its Affiliates may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others (including the Originator), which may include, without limitation, serving as portfolio manager or investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by debt obligations such as the Notes and other trusts and pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with debt obligations issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer, and the Portfolio Manager may furnish investment management and advisory services to others who may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Portfolio Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own debt obligations which are the same type as the Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager may make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of the Related Entities which differ from those effected with respect to the Portfolio. The Portfolio Manager may often be seeking simultaneously to purchase investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as portfolio manager or for other Related Entities, and the Portfolio Manager will have the discretion to apportion such investments among such entities and accounts. The Portfolio Manager cannot assure equal treatment across its investment clients. If the Portfolio Manager is presented with investment opportunities that fall within the investment objectives of the Issuer and other investment funds and accounts managed by the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Manager expects to allocate such opportunities among the Issuer and such other funds and accounts on a basis that the Portfolio Manager determines in good faith is appropriate taking into consideration such factors as the fiduciary duties owed to the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, the primary mandates of the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, the capital available to the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, any restrictions on investment, the sourcing of the transaction, the size of the transaction, the amount of potential follow-on investing that may be required for such investment and the other Collateral Obligations of the Issuer and investments by such other funds and accounts, the relation of such opportunity to the investment strategy of the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, reasons of portfolio balance, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals for the Issuer and each such other fund and any other consideration deemed relevant by the Portfolio Manager in good faith.",p,
"There are generally no ethical screens or information barriers among the Portfolio Manager and certain of its Affiliates of the type that many firms implement to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material, non-public information that could influence such decisions. If the Portfolio Manager or any of its personnel were to receive material non-public information about a particular obligor or asset, or have an interest in causing the Issuer to transact a particular asset, the Portfolio Manager may be prevented from causing the Issuer to transact such asset due to internal restrictions imposed on the Portfolio Manager. Notwithstanding the maintenance of certain internal controls relating to the management of material non-public information, it is possible that such controls could fail and result in the Portfolio Manager, or one of its investment professionals, buying or selling an asset while, at least constructively, in possession of material non-public information. Inadvertent trading on material non-public information could have adverse effects on the Portfolio Manager's reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions, and as a consequence, negatively impact the Portfolio Manager's ability to perform its investment management services to the Issuer. In addition, while the Portfolio Manager and certain of its Affiliates currently operate without information barriers on an integrated basis, such entities could be required by certain regulations, or decide that it is advisable, to establish information barriers. In such event, the Portfolio Manager's ability to operate as an integrated platform could also be impaired.",p,
"Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and consistent with and subject to applicable law (including applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act), the Portfolio Manager has",p,
"directed the Issuer to purchase, and intends to continue to direct the Issuer to purchase, certain Collateral Obligations from the Originator. The Issuer may also enter into agreements to purchase certain Collateral Obligations from other Affiliates, including @Onex, and in each case consistent with and subject to applicable law (including applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act). It is expected that transactions between the Issuer, on the one hand, and the Originator or @Onex, on the other, will be as described under ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements"". In addition, the Portfolio Manager may direct the Issuer to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations in cross trades between the Issuer and other clients of the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In such case, the Portfolio Manager and such Affiliates may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding the Issuer and the other parties to such trade. Under certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates may determine that it is appropriate to avoid such conflicts by selling a Collateral Obligation at a fair value that has been calculated pursuant to the Portfolio Manager's valuation procedures to another fund managed or advised by the Portfolio Manager or such Affiliates. In addition, in the future and with the prior blanket authorisation of the Issuer, which can be revoked at any time thereafter, the Portfolio Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law. To the extent that any such transactions may be viewed as a principal transaction due to the ownership interest in the other client by the Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates or any of their personnel, the Portfolio Manager will comply with the requirements of Section 206(3) of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act. However, the Issuer will be barred from acquiring debt assets issued by Portfolio Companies.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager and/or its Related Entities may, on behalf of either the Issuer or other of their clients, participate in creditors' committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or workout of issuers of Collateral Obligations. In such circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Obligations and in some circumstances may not be permitted to participate in such committees on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
"The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Portfolio Manager's ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations, and the Portfolio Manager is required to comply with these restrictions contained in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interests of the Issuer and the holders of the Notes, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Originator, an Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager, will, in its capacity as originator for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements, acquire at least a majority and up to 100 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. All or a portion of such Notes to be acquired by the Originator (as a ""majority owned affiliate"" of the ""sponsor"") on the Issue Date, will also constitute the U.S. Retention Interest. Subject to the requirements of the Retention Undertaking Letter and of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such Subordinated Notes may be sold by the initial holder of such Subordinated Notes to related and/or unrelated parties at any time after the Issue Date.",p,
"So long as such Subordinated Notes are held by the Originator, the Portfolio Manager or any other Portfolio Manager Related Person, such Subordinated Notes (along with any other Notes held by the Originator, the Portfolio Manager or another Portfolio Manager Related Person) shall not have any voting rights in respect of, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on any PM Removal Resolutions or any PM Replacement Resolutions (but shall carry a right to vote and be so counted on all other matters in respect of which the PM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted). See ""Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement–No Voting Rights"".",p,
The Originator owns 24 per cent. of the Issuer's outstanding ordinary shares. The investment in the Subordinated Notes and the holding of the Issuer's ordinary shares by the Originator may give the Portfolio Manager an incentive to take actions which may not be in the best interests of the other Noteholders.,p,
"The Portfolio Manager may discuss the composition of the Collateral Obligations and other matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby with any partner or employee of the Portfolio Manager,",p,
"its Affiliates or any Related Entities, and may also have such discussions with certain beneficial owners of the Notes. There can be no assurance that such discussions will not influence the actions or inactions of the Portfolio Manager in its role as portfolio manager for the Issuer, which actions or inactions may have material effects on the performance of the Notes.",p,
"No assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules would have any future material adverse effect on the Originator's or the Portfolio Manager's (as applicable) willingness to consent to any additional issuances of Notes, Refinancing, or any future material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Issuer or on the market value or liquidity of the Notes. See 2.2 ""Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules"".",p,
There is no limitation or restriction on the Portfolio Manager or any of its Affiliates with regard to acting as investment manager (or in a similar role) to other parties or persons. This and other future activities of the Portfolio Manager and/or its Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.,p,
"In certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates or both may receive compensation in connection with the investment of assets in certain Eligible Investments from the managers of such Eligible Investments. In addition, the Issuer may from time to time invest in Eligible Investments issued by, arranged by or underwritten by the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates.",p,
The Incentive Portfolio Management Fee may create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations,p,
,p,
"On each Payment Date, the Portfolio Manager may be paid the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee to the extent of funds available on such Payment Date as described in ""Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement – Compensation of the Portfolio Manager"", if the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed as of such Payment Date. Therefore, payment of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee will be dependent to a large extent on the yield earned on the Collateral Obligations. This fee structure could create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to manage the Issuer's investments in a manner as to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations relative to investments of higher creditworthiness. Managing the portfolio with the objective of increasing yield, even though the Portfolio Manager is constrained by investment restrictions described in ""The Portfolio"", could result in riskier or more speculative investments for the Issuer than would otherwise be the case and in an increase in defaults or volatility and could contribute to a decline in the aggregate market value of the Collateral Obligations.",p,
Holding of Shares in the Issuer,p,
,p,
"The Originator holds 24 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the Issuer. The other 76 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the Issuer are held by the Share Trustee on trust for charitable purposes. The fact that the Originator will have a shareholding in the Issuer gives rise to the risk that, if the Originator becomes insolvent while the Notes are outstanding, an insolvency official appointed to the Originator in Ireland could seek the making of certain orders in respect of the Issuer, including the making of a pooling or contribution order on a winding-up or an examinership of the Issuer on the basis that it is a related company of the Originator. The making of any such order in respect of the Issuer could impact the timing or amount of recoveries by Noteholders in respect of the Notes. The Issuer and the Portfolio Manager will take steps in structuring the transactions that are intended to minimise the risk that the separate identity of the Issuer would not be respected. These steps include the creation of the Issuer as a separate, special purpose company intended to be treated as bankruptcy-remote from the Originator, restrictions on the nature of its business and an undertaking by the Issuer to observe material legal formalities. The Issuer has agreed to extensive covenants in the Transaction Documents which restrict its activities and require it to conduct its business as a separate identifiable entity. The Issuer has been advised that, provided that such covenants are adhered to, the risk of an insolvency of the Originator triggering insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would be significantly mitigated. However, there can be no assurance that the commencement of any Irish insolvency proceedings in respect of the Originator would not adversely affect the affairs of the Issuer and, consequently, the Noteholders.",p,
Rating Agencies,p,
,p,
Fitch and S&P have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating,p,
"Agency for its rating services, as is the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates,p,
,p,
"Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and its Affiliates (together, the ""Credit Suisse Parties"") will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction, as a lender under the Warehouse Arrangements, as a seller of Collateral Obligations and in other roles described below.",p,
"The criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement including but not limited to the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests and Priorities of Payment may be influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have or have had with one or more investors. There is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that any adjustments or modifications which result from such discussions will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes.",p,
An Affiliate of the Initial Purchaser was also a lender under the Warehouse Arrangements.,p,
"The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. The Credit Suisse Parties may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Credit Suisse Parties expect to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,
The Credit Suisse Parties may retain a certain portion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market.,p,
"In addition, the Credit Suisse Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of such financing. The Credit Suisse Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments (including but not limited to instruments such as the Notes) for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business.",p,
"The Credit Suisse Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed, underwritten or syndicated certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Credit Suisse Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Credit Suisse Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors affiliated with the Credit Suisse Parties or in which one or more Credit Suisse Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Credit Suisse Parties' own investments in such Obligors while the value of the Notes may decline.",p,
From time to time the Portfolio Manager (pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Credit Suisse Parties and one or more Credit Suisse Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to,p,
"interests in Participations and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The entry into of Participations and/or Hedge Transactions by any Credit Suisse Party is expected to increase the profitability of such Credit Suisse Party and it is not intended that the interests of the Noteholders or any other party will be taken into account by the relevant Credit Suisse Party in the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations under Participations or Hedge Transactions. The Credit Suisse Parties may act as initial purchaser and/or portfolio manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.",p,
"The Credit Suisse Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse Parties and employees or customers of the Credit Suisse Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to, or referencing, the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. On the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties will purchase certain Classes of Notes; however, they may sell those Notes at any time. After the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties may purchase Notes from time to time. If a Credit Suisse Party becomes an owner of or obtains exposure to any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Credit Suisse Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Credit Suisse Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer, and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Collateral or the actions of the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer and will have no authority to advise the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer (respectively). If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates own Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owners of Notes in actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,
"By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.",p,
6. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT,h3,
"The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by ""qualified purchasers"" (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.",p,
No opinion or no-action position has been requested of the SEC with respect to the status of the Issuer as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.,p,
"If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences",p,
"include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.",p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Noteholder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. See 3.30 ""Forced Transfer"".",p,
7. RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER UNDER IRISH LAW,h3,
,p,
7.1 Lack of Operating History,p,
The Issuer is a recently incorporated designated activity company with limited liability under Irish law that has no prior operating history or revenues upon which may be used to evaluate its likely performance and the performance of the Notes other than the Warehouse Arrangements and related arrangements entered into by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date to finance the acquisition of Collateral Obligations.,p,
7.2 Preferred Creditors under Irish Law and Floating Charges,h3,
"If the Issuer becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Issuer has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, the Noteholders (and other Secured Parties) may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company, such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, certain rates and taxes, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company's requirements for the duration of his appointment) which have been approved by the relevant Irish courts. See 7.3 ""Examinership"".",p,
"The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.",p,
"Where the holder of the security has given notice to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder's liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners' notice to the holder of fixed security.",p,
The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.,p,
"In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company which are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.",p,
"The essence of a fixed charge is that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that",p,
"such liberty is given to the Issuer any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.",p,
"In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the monies standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.",p,
"Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security over the relevant charged assets would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.",p,
"Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:",p,
"(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;",p,
"(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up;",p,
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;,p,
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and,p,
(e) they rank after fixed charges.,p,
7.3 Examinership,h3,
"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court.",p,
"The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.",p,
"During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.",p,
"In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders.",p,
"If an examiner were appointed in respect of the Issuer, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:",p,
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;,p,
"(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;",p,
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and,p,
"(d) if a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner's remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.",p,
7.4 Irish Taxation Position of the Issuer,h3,
"Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Irish withholding tax if there is a change in Irish tax law or if the various exemption conditions set forth under ""Tax Considerations - Irish Taxation - Taxation of Noteholders -Withholding Tax"" are not fulfilled. The Issuer is not obligated to gross up or otherwise compensate Noteholders for withholding taxes incurred. This may, therefore, affect the return which Noteholders received on the Notes.",p,
Changes in Irish tax laws may adversely impact the Issuer's business and the value of the Noteholders' investment.,p,
The Issuer is treated as a securitisation vehicle which is taxed pursuant to Section 110 of the TCA. There is no guarantee that the tax treatment of an Irish securitisation company will not change in the future. The tax deductibility of the Issuer's interest costs will depend on the applicability of Section 110 TCA and the current revenue practice in relation to that matter. If these rules change this may have an impact on the return for Noteholders.,p,
"The Irish Finance Act 2019 (effective from 1 January 2020) introduces a number of anti-avoidance provisions to Section 110 of the TCA in order to strengthen the existing protections against abuse of the regime and which, in certain circumstances, can deny a deduction for profit participating interest or interest in excess of a reasonable commercial return. These amendments are taken into account in the section entitled ""Tax Considerations - Irish Taxation"".",p,

"The following are the terms and conditions of each of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, substantially in the form in which they will be endorsed on such Notes if issued in definitive certificated form and which will be incorporated by reference into the Global Certificates of each Class representing the Notes in global certificated form.",p,

RATINGS OF THE NOTES,h3,
,p,
General,p,
,p,
"It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Notes (except for the Subordinated Notes) be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes: ""AAA (sf)"" from S&P and ""AAAsf"" from Fitch; the Class B- 1 Notes: ""AA (sf)"" from S&P and ""AAsf"" from Fitch; the Class B-2 Notes: ""AA (sf)"" from S&P and ""AAsf"" from Fitch; the Class C Notes: ""A (sf)"" from S&P and ""Asf"" from Fitch; the Class D Notes: ""BBB (sf)"" from S&P and ""BBB-sf"" from Fitch; the Class E Notes: ""BB- (sf)"" from S&P and ""BB-sf"" from Fitch; the Class F Notes: ""B- (sf)"" from S&P and ""B-sf"" from Fitch. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.",p,
"The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the other Rated Notes address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.",p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.",p,
S&P Ratings,h3,
,p,
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:,p,
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;,p,
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and,p,
(c) legal considerations.,p,
"Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the period beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the expiry of the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"S&P's analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the ""S&P CDO Monitor"") which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Portfolio Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P's proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the ""Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model"") is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,
"There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, or the Originator, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.",p,
S&P's Ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its,p,
"analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.",p,
Fitch Ratings,h3,
The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Fitch are based upon Fitch's statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with similar characteristics to the Collateral Obligations and the various eligibility requirements that the Collateral Obligations are required to satisfy.,p,
"Fitch analyses the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default, based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Fitch then determines the level of credit protection necessary based on a specific percentile of the portfolio default distribution determined by the Fitch ""Portfolio Credit Model"" which takes into account the correlation between assets in the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. The results of a statistical analysis are incorporated into a cash flow model built to mimic the structure of the transaction. In this regard, the results of several default scenarios, in conjunction with various qualitative tests (e.g. analysis of the strength of the Portfolio Manager), are used to determine the credit enhancement required to support a particular rating.",p,
Fitch's ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.,p,
"There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by Fitch in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not defer from those assumed by Fitch.",p,
"In addition to those quantitative tests, Fitch ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Portfolio Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Fitch deems relevant.",p,

"Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test means that test that will be satisfied, on any Measurement Date, if the Fitch Weighted Average Rating Factor as at such date is less than or equal to the applicable level in the Fitch Tests Matrices.",p,
"Fitch Weighted Average Rating Factor is the number determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation by its Fitch Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all such Collateral Obligations and rounding the result down to the nearest two decimal places. For the purposes of determining the Principal Balance and Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations in this definition, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be excluded.",p,
"Fitch Rating Factor means, in respect of any Collateral Obligation, the number set forth in the table below opposite the Fitch Rating in respect of such Collateral Obligation. The following table provides certain probabilities of default relating to Fitch Rating Factors. The information is subject to change and any probabilities of default in respect of Fitch Rating Factors may not at any time necessarily reflect the below table.",p,

General,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager will perform certain investment management functions, including, without limitation, supervising and directing the investment and reinvestment of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments, and perform certain administrative and advisory functions on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains procedures whereby the Portfolio Manager will have discretionary authority of the Issuer in relation to the composition, acquisition and management of the Portfolio.",p,
EU Disclosure Requirements,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager, the Originator and the Collateral Administrator will each undertake, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, to perform certain duties to enable the Issuer to comply with its reporting obligations under the Securitisation Regulation, as more fully described in ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements"" section of this Offering Circular.",p,
Liability of the Portfolio Manager,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager will be required to perform its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement with reasonable care and in good faith, using a degree of skill and attention no less than that which the Portfolio Manager exercises with respect to comparable assets it manages for itself, its Affiliates and others and in accordance with practices followed by similar institutional managers of assets of the same nature and character as the Collateral in substantially similar types of transactions (the ""Standard of Care""). To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the Portfolio Manager will follow its customary standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the ""Portfolio Manager Parties"") will not be liable to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Noteholders or any other person for any losses, costs, liabilities or claims incurred as a result of the acts or omissions by the Portfolio Manager Parties under or in connection with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, or for any decrease in the value of the Collateral Obligations or the performance by the Portfolio Manager of its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including, without limitation, directing the acquisition or disposition by the Issuer of any Collateral Obligation), except by reason of (i) acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of, or reckless or intentional disregard with respect to, the duties of the Portfolio Manager thereunder (provided that a decline in the market value of any Collateral Obligation will not, by itself, constitute wilful misconduct or gross negligence by the Portfolio Manager) or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Portfolio Manager Information (including any amendment or supplement thereto contained in any amendment or supplement to this Offering Circular approved in writing by the Portfolio Manager) or any omission to state in the sections of this Offering Circular titled ""Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)"", ""Description of the Portfolio Manager"", ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – The Originator"", ""Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements",p,

"– Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules"" (together, the ""Portfolio Manager Information""), a material fact, in each case necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The matters described in (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred to as ""Portfolio Manager Breaches"" and each individually is a ""Portfolio Manager Breach"".",p,
"The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the ""Portfolio Manager Parties"") will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including any pecuniary sanctions to which the Portfolio Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation",p,

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, no Portfolio Manager Party shall be indemnified as a result of any acts or omissions by any Portfolio Manager Party constituting Portfolio Manager Breaches. To the extent a Portfolio Manager Party is indemnified by the Issuer pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the Priorities of Payment, the assets of the Issuer will be reduced accordingly and such reduction may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. Additionally, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains provisions which require that the Portfolio Manager shall not take any action on behalf of the Issuer which would cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or become otherwise subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax on a net income basis. The Portfolio Manager shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirement not to cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for",p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes or become otherwise subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax on a net income basis as long as it causes the Issuer to comply with the Tax Guidelines.",p,
The Portfolio Manager shall not be liable for any consequential or punitive losses or damages.,p,

"Each of the Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee , shall not include any VAT payable on such Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee. In the event that any supply to which",p,
"the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee relates is or becomes subject to VAT payable by the Portfolio Manager, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager in addition to such Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee against delivery of a valid VAT invoice, provided that the Portfolio Manager may agree to bear and (x) where the Portfolio Manager is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT (without prejudice to the requirement to provide a valid invoice) not receive additional amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT) or, (y) where the Issuer is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, receive a reduced amount in respect of the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee equal to the VAT exclusive amount of such fee expressed to be payable pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement less an amount equal to the VAT chargeable with respect thereto.",p,
"If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee, as applicable, equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement also provides that the Portfolio Manager will be entitled to an Incentive Portfolio Management Fee on each Payment Date on which the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed, such fee being in an amount equal to and payable from 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and (subject as provided below) shall not include any VAT payable on such Incentive Portfolio Management Fee. In the event that any supply to which the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee relates is or becomes subject to VAT payable by the Portfolio Manager, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager in addition to such Incentive Portfolio Management Fee against delivery of a valid VAT invoice, provided that the Portfolio Manager may agree to bear and (x) where the Portfolio Manager is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT (without prejudice to the requirement to provide a valid invoice) not receive additional amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT) or,",p,

"The Portfolio Manager may elect to defer any Senior Management Fees and Subordinated Management Fees. Any amounts so deferred shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.

"The Portfolio Manager may elect to irrevocably waive or designate for reinvestment some or all of the amounts that would have been payable to the Portfolio Manager as the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee under the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments on a Payment Date. Any such amounts designated for reinvestment shall be used to purchase Substitute Collateral Obligations or be deposited in the Principal Account pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations. Any such amounts irrevocably waived shall be applied to the payment of interest or principal (as applicable) on the Subordinated Notes, subject to and in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments (as applicable).",p,

"The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the payment in full of the Notes, in accordance with their terms, (ii) the liquidation of the Portfolio and the final distribution of the proceeds of such liquidation as provided in the Transaction Documents, and (iii) the determination in good faith by the Issuer that the Issuer or the Portfolio has become required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and the Issuer notifies the Portfolio Manager thereof.",p,
Any rights of the Portfolio Manager stated to survive the termination of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement shall remain vested in the Portfolio Manager after such termination in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.,p,
Resignation,h3,
"The Portfolio Manager may resign, subject to the appointment of a successor Portfolio Manager in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, with or without cause and without penalty, upon at least 90 days' written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, and each Rating Agency (or upon such shorter notice as may be agreed between the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager).",p,
Appointment of Successor,h3,
"Upon any removal or resignation of the Portfolio Manager (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Portfolio Manager to carry on its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement), the Portfolio Manager will continue to act in such capacity until the appointment by the Issuer, at the direction of the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) of an Eligible Successor in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, provided that the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) does not object in writing to such successor within 30 days after receipt of notice of such appointment. The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Portfolio Manager to assume the duties and obligations of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. If within 60 calendar days following a notice of resignation or removal, the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) do not direct the Issuer to appoint an Eligible Successor or no Eligible Successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, then the holders of the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may direct the Issuer to appoint an Eligible Successor and the Issuer shall appoint such successor unless the holders of all Rated Notes (voting as a single class) object to such appointment (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution). If within 90 days following a notice of resignation or removal no Eligible Successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Portfolio Manager may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor. For the avoidance of doubt, no Notes held in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non-Voting Notes or held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person shall have any voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting any PM Replacement Resolution or with respect to the selection or appointment of the successor Portfolio Manager following a PM Removal Resolution.",p,
"Eligible Successor means an established institution which (1) has demonstrated an ability to professionally and competently perform duties reasonably comparable to those imposed upon the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, (2) is legally qualified and has the regulatory capacity to act as successor to the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement in the assumption of all of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and under the terms of the Trust Deed applicable to the Portfolio Manager, (3) receives Rating Agency Confirmation, (4) will not cause either of the Issuer or the Portfolio to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, and (5) will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation or to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes or cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer.",p,
Upon notice of removal or resignation of the Portfolio Manager,h3,
"In the event that the Portfolio Manager has received prior written notice of its removal in accordance with the terms specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor Portfolio Manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, purchases and sales of Collateral Obligations shall be only made in relation to sale of Margin Stock, Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any purchase or sale trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).",p,
Delegation,h3,
"Save for the delegation of signing authority to agent banks in connection with amendments to the terms of Collateral Obligations and the performance of any of its duties either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, the obligations of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement may not",p,
"be delegated, in whole or in part, except to an Affiliate that is legally qualified and has the requisite regulatory capacity to provide such services and provided that without the prior written consent of the Noteholders of each Outstanding Note, such appointment will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Portfolio Management Fees becoming subject to value added or similar tax or otherwise cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding any such consent, no such delegation of duties by the Portfolio Manager shall relieve it from any liability under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. As at the Issue Date, the Portfolio Manager will delegate certain of its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement to the Portfolio Sub-Manager.

"The Originator may acquire Collateral Obligations in the primary market or the secondary market from third parties (""Market Sellers""). With respect to each Collateral Obligation that the Issuer ultimately purchases from the Originator, the Issuer will purchase such Collateral Obligation on the same trade date on which the Originator agreed to purchase such Collateral Obligation from a Market Seller by first entering into an agreement to purchase such Collateral Obligation from an Affiliate of the Originator, @Onex Holdings LLC (""@Onex""), on such trade date. @Onex is a limited liability company organised in 2000 under Delaware law. @Onex is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Onex Corporation and serves as a holding company. The purchase price to be paid by the Issuer to @Onex for such Collateral Obligation will be an amount equal to the market price for such Collateral Obligation as of such trade date. No earlier than two (2) Business Days following such trade date, it is expected that the rights and obligations of @Onex in respect of the sale of such Collateral Obligation will be transferred to the Originator by novation. In connection with such novation, (a) to the extent the market value of such Collateral Obligation has increased since the original trade date therefor, @Onex will compensate the Originator for any such increase and (b) to the extent the market value of such Collateral Obligation has decreased since the original trade date therefor, the Originator will compensate @Onex for any such decrease.

Pursuant to the novation, the Originator will have assumed all obligations of @Onex to sell such Collateral Obligation to the Issuer and will be obligated to sell such Collateral Obligation to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and at the market price initially agreed to between the Issuer and @Onex on the original trade date therefor. The Purchase and Sale Agreement shall also provide that if, on the date that is 15 days after the original trade date in respect of the purchase of such Collateral Obligation by the Originator (the ""Originator Interest Period""), either (a) a payment default with respect to the interest or principal due and payable under such Collateral Obligation has occurred and is continuing or (b) there has been a bankruptcy, receivership or other insolvency proceeding or reorganisation event in each case with respect to the underlying obligor of such Collateral Obligation, then the Issuer will not be obligated to purchase or pay the applicable purchase price in respect of such Collateral Obligation (or, to the extent the Issuer has purchased or paid the applicable purchase price in respect of such Collateral Obligation prior to the last day of such Originator Interest Period, the Originator will repurchase such Collateral Obligation at the applicable purchase price for such Collateral Obligation paid by the Issuer). As a result, the Originator will be exposed to such payment or bankruptcy risk on such Collateral Obligations for the period between its purchase by the Originator and the end of the applicable Originator Interest Period. In connection with such purchases from the Originator, the Issuer will reimburse the Originator for any reasonable expenses incurred by the Originator in connection with the purchase and sale of the Collateral Obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement.",p,

"To calculate the fair value of the Subordinated Notes that will be included in the U.S. Retention Interest, the Portfolio Manager used a discounted cash flow methodology to derive an estimate of value based on projected future cash flows on the Notes. In generating such projected future cash flows, a third-party cash flow modeling engine was used to project future interest and principal payments on the Collateral Obligations, the interest and principal payments on each Class of Notes, and the fees and expenses of the transaction parties. The resulting net cash flows to the Subordinated Notes were then discounted to present value using a discount rate intended to reflect a hypothetical market yield.",p,
A third-party unaffiliated valuation firm was engaged to assist the Portfolio Manager in connection with certain of the calculations set forth in this section. Such third-party unaffiliated valuation firm performed certain financial analyses and relied on certain information provided to it by third parties or available from public sources as being accurate and complete in all respects and which the third-party unaffiliated valuation firm did not independently verify. The results of the financial analyses performed by such third-party unaffiliated valuation firm were among the factors taken into consideration in connection with certain of the calculations set forth in this section but were not determinative.,p,

" Priorities of Payment: For purposes of the Priorities of Payment, (i) no taxes or governmental fees are owed by the Issuer, (ii) the aggregate of Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses will be equal to the full amount permitted by the definition of Senior Expenses Cap, (iii) no Special Redemption, Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing, issuance of additional Notes, Note Tax Event, Collateral Tax Event, Note Event of Default or acceleration of the Notes occurs with respect to any Payment Date after the Issue Date; (iv) there are no Principal Proceeds that the Portfolio Manager has determined cannot be reasonably reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria; and (v) there are no Defaulted Obligations in excess of that which is specified below, no Discount Obligations, no Excess CCC Adjustment Amounts and no accrued interest received in connection with any Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment to the extent such amount was not purchased with Interest Proceeds;",p,
" Initial Collateral Obligations: Collateral Obligations either owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date or identified to be purchased on or around the Issue Date will (i) have an aggregate principal amount of approximately EUR 250,000,000 and (ii) be comprised of 93.8% Floating Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a spread equal to 3.51% over EURIBOR and 6.2% Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a coupon equal to 2.35%;",p,
" Reinvestment Collateral Obligations: Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer through reinvestment after the Issue Date will (i) be acquired for a purchase price equal to 92.5% for the first twelve months,",p,
"95.0% for the following twelve months, then 99.5% thereafter; (ii) approximately 100.0% be Floating Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a spread equal to 3.50% over EURIBOR (with 100.0% of such Collateral Obligations having a EURIBOR floor of 0.00% and an all-in floor of 3.50%);",p,
" Prepayment Rate: Prepayments on Collateral Obligations for each three month period are assumed to be equal to the product of (i) a constant annual prepayment rate of 10.0% for the first twelve months, then 25.0% thereafter, dividend by four; and (ii) the outstanding balance of the applicable Collateral Obligations as of the end of the immediately preceding three month period, after adjusting for any scheduled prepayments on the Collateral Obligations during such three month period;",p,
" Default Rate: Defaulted Obligations for each three month period are assumed to be equal to the product of (i) an annual default rate of 4.0% for the first twelve months, then 2.0% thereafter (""Annual Default Rate""), divided by four and (ii) the outstanding balance of the applicable Collateral Obligations as of the end of the immediately preceding three month period;",p,
" Recovery Rate: Recoveries on Defaulted Obligations are assumed to be at a recovery rate of 70.0% for the first twelve months, then 75.0% thereafter (""Assumed Recovery Rate""), and occur 12 months after each applicable default;",p,
" Optional Redemption: 12 months after the end of the Reinvestment Period, with the Collateral Obligations being sold at par; and",p,
 Forward Rates: EURIBOR is assumed to reset consistent with the applicable 3-month forward curve.,p,
"These key inputs and assumptions were based on certain publicly available market data and/or information provided by third-party sources (including, the third-party valuation agent) as well as considering the following factors:",p,
" The discount rates were selected based on observations of market participants' expected rates of return in the new-issue market and secondary-trading market for CLOs specifically and, to a lesser extent, other comparable structured credit asset classes.",p,
" The prepayment rate, default rate, the assumed recovery rate and assumed recovery lag were estimated considering the repayment rate, default rate and recovery rate and certain observed historical data (including trading prices) for loans similar to the Collateral Obligations.",p,
 The assumed weighted average spread was estimated considering the price and spread and certain observed historical data for new issue and secondary loans similar to the Collateral Obligations.,p,
 The assumed optional redemption date was estimated considering that in most circumstances Noteholders of Subordinated Notes will elect to call the CLO early if the return expected to be generated thereby is greater than the return expected to be generated from holding the Subordinated Notes to the final maturity date.,p,
" The assumed interest rate ranges for the Notes were generally informed by recent new-issue spreads and refinancings of similarly rated CLO debt classes, with similar assumed pool and asset quality, payment priority and weighted average lives to the related Class of Notes as of the calculation date.",p,
" The discount yield of the Subordinated Notes was generally informed by the discount yields observed on CLO notes, with similar assumed pool and asset quality, payment priority and weighted average lives to the Subordinated Notes as of the calculation date.",p,
Post-Closing Update,h3,
"Subject to the same limitations above in this section, including the disclaimer regarding ""Forward Looking Statements,"" the first Monthly Report (or such earlier report as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) delivered to the Noteholders after the Issue Date will include the following additional information provided by the Portfolio Manager (determined by the Portfolio Manager as of the Issue Date): (i) the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all Notes) and the Euro amount of the Subordinated Notes held by the Originator as of the Issue Date (based on actual sale prices and finalised Class sizes); (ii) the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all Notes) and the Euro amount of the Subordinated Notes that the",p,

Gross up,p,
,p,
"Under each Hedge Agreement, each of the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty shall represent that payments made by it under such Hedge Agreement (other than default interest) will not be subject to withholding tax imposed by its relevant jurisdiction. The Issuer will not be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder, however the applicable Hedge Counterparty may in certain circumstances be obliged to gross up a payment thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Any such event may however result in a ""Tax Event"" which is a ""Termination Event"" for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. In the event of the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement), each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant Affected Party (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours to (i) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (ii) (in the case of the Issuer) if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation).",p,
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition,p,
,p,
The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment); provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non- Petition).,p,
Termination Provisions,p,
,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of certain events, which may include but are not limited to:",p,

(g) upon the early redemption in full or acceleration of the Notes; and,p,
(h) any other event as specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement.,p,
Hedge Agreements commonly also contain provisions which allow a Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of certain credit events or restructurings related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation.,p,
A termination of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction does not constitute a Note Event of Default under the Notes though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an additional termination event under a Hedge Agreement.,p,
"Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or Termination Event (each as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement), a Hedge Agreement may be terminated by the Hedge Counterparty or the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) in accordance with the detailed provisions thereof and a lump sum (the ""Termination Payment"") may become payable by the Issuer to the applicable Hedge Counterparty or vice versa. Depending on the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement, such Termination Payment may be determined by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and/or Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) by reference to market quotations obtained in respect of the entry into a replacement swap(s) on the same terms as that terminated or as otherwise described in the applicable Hedge Agreement or any loss suffered by a party, subject to and in accordance with the relevant Hedge Agreement.",p,
Rating Downgrade Requirements,p,
,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement will contain provisions requiring certain remedial action to be taken in the event that the Hedge Counterparty (or, as relevant, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade, such provisions being in accordance with the rating methodology of the Rating Agencies at the time of entry into such Hedge",p,
"Agreements. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity (or, as relevant, its guarantor) meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.",p,
Transfer and Modification,p,
,p,
"The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.",p,
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.,p,
Governing Law,p,
,p,
"Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder, in each case including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with English Law.",p,
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data,h3,

"In addition, the following defined terms are incorporated into the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports:",p,
"Assigned Moody's Rating means the monitored publicly available rating or the estimated rating or the unpublished monitored loan rating, in each case expressly assigned to a debt obligation (or facility) by Moody's that addresses the full amount of the principal and interest promised.",p,
"CFR means, with respect to an obligor of a Collateral Obligation, if such obligor has a corporate family rating by Moody's, then such corporate family rating; provided, if such obligor does not have a corporate family rating by Moody's but any entity in the obligor's corporate family does have a corporate family rating, then the CFR is such corporate family rating.",p,
"The ""Diversity Score"" is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody's uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):",p,
"(a) an ""Average Principal Balance"" is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;",p,
"(b) an ""Obligor Principal Balance"" is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the",p,
"other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;",p,
"(c) an ""Equivalent Unit Score"" is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;",p,
"(d) an ""Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score"" is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody's industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody's from time to time);",p,
"(e) an ""Industry Diversity Score"" is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody's from time to time) (the ""Diversity Score Table"") for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table; and",p,
"(f) each of the following industrial classification groups is deemed to be ""local"" in Moody's opinion (""Local Industry""):",p,
(i) Environmental Industries;,p,
(ii) Sovereign & Public Finances;,p,
(iii) Utilities: Electric;,p,
(iv) Utilities: Oil & Gas; and,p,
(v) Utilities: Water.,p,
"For the purposes of calculating the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score, where two or more Local Industries are located in different geographical regions, each such Local Industry will be treated as a separate industry.",p,

Deductibility of Interest by Qualifying Companies holding Specified Mortgages,p,
,p,
"As a result of changes to Section 110 of the TCA introduced in Finance Act 2016 a restriction on the deductibility of interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return on the principal outstanding or is dependent on the results of the business of the ""qualifying company"" can apply from 6 September 2016 to the extent that the ""qualifying company"" holds and/or manages one or more ""specified mortgages"" (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA), being, inter alia, a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land.",p,
"The Finance Act 2017 extended the interest restriction introduced in the Finance Act 2016 to profit participating or excessive interest payable on or after 19 October 2017 by a ""qualifying company"" which holds and/or manages shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value, directly or indirectly from Irish land. Shares that derive their value from, or the greater part of their value from, directly or indirectly, land in Ireland are to be included in the definition of ""specified property business"" (as defined in Section 110(5A)) to which the interest restriction can apply.",p,
"However, this restriction does not apply to the calculation of the profits arising to a ""qualifying company"" from, inter alia, a ""CLO transaction"" (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA) or activities which are preparatory thereto.

"(a) the Issuer does not hold and/or manage ""specified mortgages""; or",p,

Taxation of Noteholders,p,
,p,
Persons Subject to Irish Income or Corporation Tax,p,
,p,
"In general, persons who are resident in Ireland are liable to Irish taxation on their world-wide income whereas persons who are not resident in Ireland are only liable to Irish taxation on their Irish source income. All persons are under a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.",p,
"Interest paid and discounts realised on the Notes have an Irish source and therefore interest earned and discounts realised on such Notes will be regarded as Irish source income. Accordingly, pursuant to general Irish tax rules, a non-Irish resident person in receipt of such income would be technically liable to Irish income tax (and the universal social charge if received by an individual) subject to the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty.",p,
"Ireland has currently 73 double tax treaties in effect and the majority of them exempt interest (which sometimes includes discounts) from Irish tax when received by a resident of the other jurisdiction. Credit is available for any Irish tax withheld from income on account of the related income tax liability. Non-Irish resident companies, where the income is not attributable to a branch or agency of the company in Ireland, are subject to income tax at the standard rate. Therefore any withholding tax suffered should be equal to and in satisfaction of the full income tax liability. (Non-Irish resident companies operating in Ireland through a branch or agency of the company in Ireland to which the income is attributable would be subject to Irish corporation tax).",p,
There is an exemption from Irish income tax under Section 198 of the TCA in certain circumstances. These circumstances include:,p,
(a) where the interest is paid by a company in the ordinary course of business carried on by it to a company,p,
"(i) which, by virtue of the law of a relevant territory, is resident in the relevant territory for the purposes of tax, and that relevant territory imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside that territory, or (ii) where the interest is either (A) exempted from the charge to income tax under arrangements made with the government of a territory outside Ireland having the force of law under procedures set out in Section 826(1) of the TCA, or (B) would be exempted from the charge to income tax if arrangements made, on or before the date of payment of the interest with the government of a territory outside Ireland that do not have force of law under procedures set out in Section 826(1) of the TCA, had the force of law when the interest was paid;",p,
(b) where the interest is paid by a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA out of the assets of that qualifying company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory);,p,
"(c) where the interest is payable on a quoted Eurobond (see ""Withholding Tax"" below) and is paid by a company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory) or to a company controlled, either directly or indirectly by a person or persons who are resident in a relevant territory and are not controlled, either directly or indirectly by persons who are not so resident; or",p,
"(d) where discounts arise to a person in respect of securities issued by a company in the ordinary course of a trade or business, where that person is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory).",p,
"Interest on the Notes and discounts realised which do not fall within the exemptions in Section 198 of the TCA are within the charge to Irish income tax to the extent that a double tax treaty does not exempt the interest or discount as the case may be. However, it is understood that the Irish Revenue Commissioners have, in the past, operated a practice (as a consequence of the absence of a collection mechanism rather than adopted policy) whereby no action will be taken to pursue any liability to such Irish tax in respect of persons who are regarded as not being resident in Ireland except where such persons:",p,
(i) are chargeable in the name of a person (including a trustee) or in the name of an agent or branch in Ireland having the management or control of the interest; or,p,
(ii) seek to claim relief and/or repayment of tax deducted at source in respect of taxed income from Irish sources; or,p,
(iii) are chargeable to Irish corporation tax on the income of an Irish branch or agency or to income tax on the profits of a trade carried on in Ireland to which the interest is attributable.,p,
"There can be no assurance that the Irish Revenue Commissioners will apply this practice in the case of the holders of Notes and, as mentioned above, there is a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.",p,
Withholding Tax,p,
,p,
"In general, withholding tax (unless exempted) at the current rate of 20 per cent. must be deducted from interest payments made by an Irish resident company. However, there is an exemption from withholding tax under Irish domestic law in respect of, inter alia, interest payments made by a qualifying company (within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA) to a person resident for the purposes of tax in a relevant territory except where the person is a company and the interest is received in connection with a trade carried out by that company through a branch or agency in Ireland. There is a further exemption from withholding tax under Irish domestic law in respect of interest on ""quoted Eurobonds"" in certain circumstances, which is expected to apply to the interest payments on the Notes.",p,
"A ""quoted Eurobond"" is defined as a security which:",p,
(a) is issued by a company;,p,
(b) is quoted on a recognised stock exchange; and,p,
(c) carries a right to interest.,p,
There is no obligation to withhold tax on quoted Eurobonds where:,p,
(i) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or,p,
"(ii) the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and:",p,
(A) either the quoted Eurobond is held in a recognised clearing system; or,p,
(B) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made an appropriate written declaration to this effect to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland).,p,
Encashment Tax,p,
,p,
"In certain circumstances, Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.",p,
Capital Gains Tax on Disposal of Notes,p,
,p,
"Persons who are resident in Ireland or companies which carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable and who realise a gain on the disposal of a Note may be liable to Irish taxation on capital gains at a current rate of 33 per cent. of the amount of the chargeable capital gain. In addition, any currency gain realised by such a person from a U.S. dollar denominated offering may be also liable to capital gains at a rate of 33 per cent. of the amount of the currency gain. Individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and companies that are not resident in Ireland and do not carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of Notes.",p,
Stamp Duty,p,
,p,
"For so long as the Issuer is a ""qualifying company"" within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA, Irish stamp duty will not be imposed on the issue or transfer of the Notes provided the money raised by the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer's business.",p,
Capital Acquisitions Tax,p,
,p,
"A gift or inheritance of Notes will be subject to capital acquisitions tax (""CAT"") if either the disposer or the beneficiary of the Notes is resident or ordinary resident in Ireland or if any of the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland. CAT is a tax imposed primarily on the beneficiary. It is currently payable at a rate of 33 per cent. on the taxable value of the gift or inheritance subject to tax free thresholds. Gifts and inheritances between spouses are exempt from CAT.",p,
FATCA Implementation in Ireland,p,
,p,
"On 21 December 2012, the Governments of Ireland and the United States signed an intergovernmental agreement (the ""Ireland IGA"" ). In July 2014, Ireland enacted Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 (the ""Irish FATCA Regulations"").",p,
"The Ireland IGA and Irish FATCA Regulations will increase the amount of tax information automatically exchanged between Ireland and the United States. They provide for the automatic reporting and exchange of information in relation to accounts held in Irish ""financial institutions"" by U.S. persons and the reciprocal exchange of information regarding U.S. financial accounts held by Irish residents.",p,
"The Issuer intends to carry on its business in such a way as to ensure that it is treated as complying with FATCA pursuant to the terms of the Ireland IGA and the Irish FATCA Regulations. The Issuer expects to be treated as a ""financial institution"". The Issuer shall be required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service as a ""reporting financial institution"" for FATCA purposes. In order for the Issuer to comply with its FATCA obligations it will be required to report certain information to the Irish Revenue Commissioners relating to Noteholders who, for FATCA purposes, are specified US persons, non-participating financial institutions or passive non-financial foreign entities (""NFFEs"") that are controlled by specified US persons. Any information reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners will be communicated to the US Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the IGA. It is possible that the Irish Revenue Commissioners may also communicate this information to other tax authorities pursuant to the terms of any applicable double tax treaty, intergovernmental agreement or exchange of information regime.",p,
"The Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their FATCA status, identity or residency required by the Issuer to satisfy its FATCA obligations. Noteholders will be deemed, by their subscription for or holding of Notes to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer or any other authorised person to the relevant tax authorities.",p,
"The Issuer should not generally be subject to FATCA withholding tax in respect of its US source income for so long as it complies with its FATCA obligations. However, FATCA withholding tax may arise on US source payments to the Issuer if the Issuer does not comply with its FATCA registration and reporting obligations and the US Internal Revenue Service has specifically identified the Issuer as being a 'non-participating financial institution' for FATCA purposes. In addition, the Issuer may be unable to comply with its FATCA obligations if Noteholders do not provide the required certifications or information. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential implication of the reporting requirements imposed on the Issuer by FATCA before investing.",p,
The Common Reporting Standard in Ireland,p,
,p,
"On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (""CRS""). The CRS provides that certain entities (known as Financial Institutions) shall identify ""Accounts"" (as defined, broadly equity and debt interests in the Financial Institution) held by persons who are tax resident in another CRS participating jurisdiction. That information is then subject to annual automatic exchange between governments in CRS participating jurisdictions.",p,
"Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (""DAC II"" ) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU member states (""Member States"" ) to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year. Ireland has provided for the implementation of CRS through Section 891F of the TCA and the enactment of the Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 (the ""CRS Regulations""). Irish Financial Institutions will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II.",p,
"The Issuer is expected to constitute a Financial Institution for CRS purposes. In order to comply with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, the Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide certain information in respect of the Noteholder's and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons' tax status, identity or residence. Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding of the Rated Notes, to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will then exchange the information with the tax or governmental authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. To the extent that the Notes are held within a recognised clearing system, the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year.",p,
"Provided the Issuer complies with these obligations, it should be deemed compliant for CRS and DAC II purposes. Failure by the Issuer to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in it being deemed to be non- compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed pursuant to the Irish implementing legislation.",p,
U.S. Federal Income Taxation,h3,
,p,
Introduction,h4,
"This is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, beneficial ownership, disposition, and retirement of the Notes. Except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular Noteholder based on such Noteholder's particular circumstances, nor does it address any aspect of state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, alternative minimum tax considerations or the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate taxes. In particular, except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to Noteholders that are subject to special treatment, including Noteholders that:",p,
"(a) are broker-dealers, securities traders, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies or grantor trusts;",p,
(b) are certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;,p,
"(c) hold Notes as part of a ""straddle"", ""hedge"", ""conversion"", ""synthetic security"", ""integrated transaction"" or ""constructive sale"" with other investments; or",p,
(d) are partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.,p,
This discussion considers only Noteholders that will hold Notes as capital assets and does not address special tax consequences that apply to U.S. Noteholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion is generally limited to the tax consequences to initial Noteholders that purchase Notes upon their initial issue at their issue price (as defined below).,p,
"For purposes of this discussion, ""U.S. Noteholder"" means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:",p,
(a) a citizen or individual resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;,p,
(b) a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organised under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein;,p,
"(c) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source; or",p,
"(d) a trust, (i) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii)(A) if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust; and",p,
(B) one or more U.S. Persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.,p,
"The term ""non-U.S. Noteholder"" means, for purposes of this discussion, a beneficial owner of the Notes that is neither a U.S. Noteholder nor a partnership.",p,
"If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to the consequences of the acquisition, ownership, disposition and retirement of the Notes.",p,
"This discussion is based upon the Code, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, each as available and in effect as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. Furthermore, there are no cases or rulings by the IRS addressing entities similar to the Issuer or securities similar to the Notes. As a result, the IRS might disagree with all or part of the discussion below. No rulings will be requested of the IRS regarding the issues discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Notes.",p,
"Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisor concerning the application of U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the laws of any state or local taxing jurisdiction, to their particular situation.",p,
"Investors should be aware that a Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with a cash contribution in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts). Except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address the consequences to Noteholders of such cash contributions.",p,
"PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.",p,
United States Taxation of the Issuer,h3,
Generally. The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Trust Deed will provide that the Issuer agrees not to elect to be treated otherwise for such purposes.,p,
"United States Federal Income Taxes. The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income (including as a result of the manner in which it acquires, holds and disposes of assets). In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP upon the issuance of the Notes, to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, including certain investment guidelines referenced therein (the ""Tax Guidelines""), and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the Tax Guidelines or the Trust Deed may not give rise to a default or an Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Tax Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the opinion",p,
"of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Issuer is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, however, there could be material adverse financial consequences to the Issuer and to persons who hold the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer's net income will not become subject to U.S. federal net income tax as a result of unanticipated activities by the Issuer, changes in law, contrary conclusions by U.S. tax authorities or other causes. In such a case, the Issuer would be potentially subject to substantial U.S. federal income tax and, in certain circumstances, interest payments by the Issuer under the Notes could be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The imposition of any of the foregoing taxes would materially affect the Issuer's ability to pay principal, interest, and other amounts owing in respect of the Notes.",p,
"Withholding and Similar Taxes. Although the Issuer does not intend to be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its net income, income derived by the Issuer may be subject to withholding or similar taxes imposed by the United States or other countries, and the imposition of such taxes could materially affect its financial ability to make payments on the Notes. In this regard and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer may generally only acquire a particular Collateral Obligation if, at the time of commitment to purchase, payments to the Issuer will not be subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than U.S. withholding taxes on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees), whether by virtue of an applicable double taxation treaty or otherwise, unless (i) the Obligor is required to make ""gross-up"" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis or (ii) such withholding can be sheltered by the application of an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise. The Issuer may, however, be subject to withholding or similar taxes in respect of interest and disposition proceeds in respect of Collateral Obligations, and such withholding or similar taxes may not be grossed up.",p,
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that income derived by the Issuer will not become subject to withholding or similar taxes as a result of changes in law, contrary conclusions by the IRS, or other causes. In that event, such withholding or similar taxes could be applied retroactively to fees or other income previously received by the Issuer. To the extent that withholding or similar taxes are imposed and not paid through withholding, the Issuer may be directly liable to the taxing authority to pay such taxes. The imposition of unanticipated withholding or similar taxes could materially impair the Issuer's ability to make payments with respect to the Notes.",p,
"Representations. Each holder and beneficial owner of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note that is not a ""United States person"" (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) will make, or by acquiring such Note or an interest therein will be deemed to make, a representation to the effect that (A) either (i) it is not a bank (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code), (ii) it has provided an IRS Form W-8BEN-E representing that it is a person that is eligible for benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that eliminates U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. source interest not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States or (iii) all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and (B) it is not purchasing the Note in order to reduce its U.S. federal income tax liability pursuant to a tax avoidance plan within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.881-3.",p,
U.S. Characterisation and U.S. Tax Treatment of the Notes,h4,
"Upon the issuance of the Notes, Paul Hastings LLP will deliver an opinion generally to the effect that under current law, assuming compliance with the Transaction Documents, and based on certain assumptions and factual representations made by the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as debt of the Issuer for",p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be given in respect of the Class F Notes, although the Issuer intends to treat the Class F Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Rated Note, each Noteholder of a Rated Note (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have agreed, to treat the Rated Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The determination of whether a Rated Note will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the Rated Note is issued. Prospective investors should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise as something other than indebtedness any particular Class or Classes of the Rated Notes, particularly the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes.

U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes,h3,
"Payments of Interest on the Rated Notes. A U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses the cash method of accounting must include in income the U.S. dollar value of interest paid when received. Interest received in a currency other than the U.S. dollar (a ""foreign currency"") is translated at the U.S. dollar spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A cash method",p,
U.S. Noteholder therefore generally will not have foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of an interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss upon disposing of the foreign currency received.,p,
"A U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses the accrual method of accounting or any U.S. Noteholder required to accrue original issue discount (""OID"") will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of interest accrued during the accrual period. An accrual basis U.S. Noteholder may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest using either of two methods, in either case regardless of whether the payments are in fact converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest is translated at the average rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). An accrual method U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses this first method will therefore recognise foreign currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest paid to the extent that the exchange rate on the date the interest is received differs from the rate at which the interest income was accrued. Under the second method, the U.S. Noteholder can elect to accrue interest at the spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the partial period within the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five business days of the receipt of such interest, the spot rate on the date of receipt. An election to accrue interest at the spot rate generally will apply to all foreign currency denominated debt instruments held by the U.S. Noteholder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a U.S. Noteholder may have additional foreign currency gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the foreign currency received.",p,
"For U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID is the excess of the ""stated redemption price at maturity"" of a debt instrument over its ""issue price"", if that excess equals or exceeds ¼ of 1 per cent. of the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity, or weighted average maturity in the case of instalment obligations (the ""OID de minimis amount""). The ""stated redemption price at maturity"" of a debt instrument such as the Rated Notes is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Rated Note other than ""qualified stated interest"" payments. The ""issue price"" of a Rated Note generally is the first offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt instrument is sold. The term ""qualified stated interest"" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain conditions discussed below, at a variable rate.",p,
"Prospective U.S. Noteholders should note that to the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (together the ""Deferrable Notes"") are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes. Consequently, such interest is not unconditionally payable in cash or property at least annually and will not be treated as ""qualified stated interest"". Therefore, all of the stated interest payments on each of the Deferrable Notes, will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity of such Notes, and as a result the Deferrable Notes will be treated as issued with OID.",p,
"It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID, such as the provisions of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code (debt instruments that may be accelerated by reason of the prepayment of other debt obligations securing such debt instruments) are applicable to the Rated Notes that are treated as issued with OID. Special tax rules principally relating to the accrual of OID, market discount, and bond premium apply to debt instruments described in Section 1272(a)(6). Further, those debt",p,
instruments may not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as part of an integrated transaction with a related hedge under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-6. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effects of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code.,p,
"If a U.S. Noteholder holds a Rated Note with OID (an ""OID Note"") such U.S. Noteholder may be required to include OID in income before receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Noteholder's accounting method for tax purposes. If the U.S. Noteholder is an initial purchaser of an OID Note, the amount of the OID includible in income is the sum of the daily accruals of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which such U.S. Noteholder held the OID Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the OID Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between: (a) the product of the ""adjusted issue price"" of the OID Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period); and (b) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The ""adjusted issue price"" of an OID Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the OID Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments the U.S. Noteholder received on the OID Note that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, the U.S. Noteholder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.",p,

The Rated Notes will qualify as variable rate debt instruments, provided the issue price is not more than 115,000 Euro per 100,000 Euro principal amount. Interest payments on certain ""variable rate debt instruments"" may be considered qualified stated interest.",p,
"If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument will be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. Thus, if any class of the Rated Notes does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, a U.S. Noteholder would be required to report income in respect of such Notes in accordance with U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments, which generally require a U.S. Noteholder to accrue interest on a constant yield basis based on a projected payment schedule determined by the Issuer. The contingent payment debt instrument rules are complex and investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the potential taxation of the Notes under the contingent payment debt instrument rules.",p,
"The OID rules are complex. Moreover, a U.S. Noteholder that uses the accrual method of accounting generally will be required to include certain amounts in ordinary income no later than the taxable year in which the U.S. Noteholder takes such amounts into account as revenue in an ""applicable financial statement"". The application of this rule thus may require the accrual of income earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described above; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations generally exclude OID from this new rule. U.S. Noteholders are permitted to rely on the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations with respect to the Notes, provided that any such",p,

Unless a non-recognition provision applies, a U.S. Noteholder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale, exchange, repayment or other disposition of a Rated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised plus the fair market value of any property received on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and the U.S. Noteholder's adjusted tax basis in such Rated Note.",p,
"The amount realised on the sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note generally is determined by translating the proceeds into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note is disposed of, while a U.S. Noteholder's adjusted tax basis in a Rated Note generally will be the cost of the Rated Note to the U.S. Noteholder, determined by translating the purchase price into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note was purchased, and increased by the amount of any OID accrued and reduced by any payments other than payments of qualified stated interest of such Note. If, however, the Rated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Noteholder or electing accrual basis U.S. Noteholder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date. An election by an accrual basis U.S. Noteholder to apply the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will be subject to the rules regarding currency translation elections described above, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Base Rate Amendment,p,
,p,
"The Issuer may enter into one or more supplemental trust deeds or another modification to change the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes to an alternative Rate of Interest (such change, a ""Base Rate Amendment""). It is possible that a Base Rate Amendment will be treated as a deemed exchange of old notes for new notes, which may be taxable to U.S. Noteholders. Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, a change in the reference rate from LIBOR or EURIBOR to a ""qualified rate"" as defined in such proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations generally will not be treated as a modification of a Floating Rate Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations may be relied upon by a taxpayer if the taxpayer and its related parties consistently apply the rules in the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations. If a Base Rate Amendment was classified as a modification, and such modification were treated as a ""significant modification"" for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which would generally occur if such Base Rate Amendment causes a change in the yield of a Floating Rate Note by more than the greater of (x) 0.25 per cent. or (y) 5.0 per cent. of the annual yield of the Note prior to the Base Rate Amendment), then unless the Base Rate Amendment is treated as a tax-free ""recapitalization"" for U.S. federal income tax purpose or another exception exists at the time of the Base Rate Amendment, the Base Rate Amendment could cause a U.S. Noteholder of a Floating Rate Note to recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair market value of the modified Floating Rate Note (if the Floating Rate Note is treated as publicly traded) or its principal amount (if the Floating Rate Note is not treated as publicly traded), in each case not including any accrued but unpaid interest (which will be taxable as such) and (ii) the holder's tax basis in the Floating Rate Note. Any gain will be long- term capital gain if the Floating Rate Note was held for more than one year at the time of the Base Rate Amendment, or otherwise short-term capital gain. The tax on any such gain may exceed the after-tax distributions on the Note during the taxable year in which the Base Rate Amendment occurs, in which case the U.S. Noteholder would be required to fund its tax liability in respect of the gain from other sources. In the event that a Base Rate Amendment is treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Noteholder's holding period in respect of the modified Floating Rate Note will begin on the day following the modification. U.S. Noteholders may not be permitted to recognize loss upon a Base Rate Amendment. In addition, a Base Rate Amendment could create or change the amount of any OID that U.S. Noteholders are required to include with respect to their Floating Rate Notes. Finally, in the event that the issue price of the Class of deemed new Floating Rate Notes is less than the principal amount of such Floating Rate Notes, the Issuer may be required to recognize cancellation of indebtedness income. This may result in adverse consequences for the Subordinated Notes. For",p,
"example, a U.S. Noteholder of a Subordinated Note may be required to include its pro rata share of the Issuer's cancellation of indebtedness income if such holder has in effect a QEF election (as discussed and defined below) or, in certain circumstances, if the U.S. Noteholder owns (directly, indirectly, or by attribution) at least 10.0 per cent. of the combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Issuer. U.S. Noteholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the potential consequences of a Base Rate Amendment.",p,
Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes.,p,
"It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as ""contingent payment debt instruments"" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Noteholder's OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.",p,
"As described above the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. dollar value of gain on the sale of the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and the U.S. dollar value of certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Noteholder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Noteholder's ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a QEF and so electing at the appropriate time. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity, a U.S. Noteholder will also be required to file an annual PFIC report. The Issuer will provide, upon such U.S. Noteholder's request and at the Issuer's expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Noteholder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to make and maintain a ""protective"" QEF election.",p,
"Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a CFC, and a",p,
"U.S. Noteholder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Noteholder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under ""U.S. Tax Treatment of",p,

"If the Issuer holds any Collateral Obligations that are treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, U.S. Noteholders of Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Noteholder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Noteholder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Noteholders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Noteholder would be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.",p,
"In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Noteholder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Noteholder's purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000.",p,

Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for,p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes if 75 per cent. or more of its gross income (including the pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which the non-U.S. corporation is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) in a taxable year is passive income. Alternatively, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC if at least 50 per cent. of its assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based on fair market value (including the pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which the Issuer is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) are held for the production of, or produce, passive income.",p,
"Based on the assets that the Issuer expects to hold and the income anticipated thereon, it is highly likely that the Issuer will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the following discussion assumes that the Issuer will be a PFIC throughout the term of the Subordinated Notes, and U.S. Noteholders of Subordinated Notes should assume that they will be subject to the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below that result from owning stock in a PFIC (subject to the discussion below under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"").",p,

An interest charge is also applied to the deferred tax amount resulting from the deemed rateable distribution.",p,
"If a U.S. Noteholder elects to treat the Issuer as a QEF, distributions and gain will not be taxed as if recognised rateably over the U.S. Noteholder's holding period or subject to an interest charge. Instead, a U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election is required for each taxable year to include in income the U.S. Noteholder's pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of the QEF as ordinary income and a pro rata share of the net capital gain of the QEF as capital gain, regardless of whether such earnings or gain have in fact been distributed (assuming the discussion below under ""Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation"" does not apply), and subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes, which deferral is subject to an interest charge. Consequently, in order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Noteholder must receive from the Issuer certain information (""QEF Information""). The Issuer will provide, or cause its independent accountants to provide, U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes, upon reasonable request by such U.S. Noteholder with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Noteholder would need to make a QEF election. Except as expressly noted, the discussion below assumes that a QEF election will not be made.",p,
"Where a QEF election is not timely made by a U.S. Noteholder for the year in which it acquired its Subordinated Notes (or any other Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes), but is made for a later year, the excess distribution rules can be avoided for such later year and subsequent years by making an election to recognise gain from a deemed sale of such Notes at the time when the QEF election becomes effective.",p,

"Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. Depending on the degree of ownership of the Subordinated Notes and other equity interests in the Issuer by U.S. Noteholders and whether the Subordinated Notes are treated as voting securities, the Issuer may constitute a CFC.

Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, ""subpart F income"" includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, substantially all of its income would be subpart F income.

Foreign Currency Gain or Loss. A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or other Notes treated as equity interests in the Issuer) that recognises income from the Subordinated Notes under the QEF or CFC rules discussed above will recognise foreign currency gain or loss attributable to movement in foreign exchange rates between the date when it recognised income under those rules and the date when the income actually is distributed. Any such foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss from the same source as the associated income inclusion.,p,
A U.S. Noteholder that purchases Subordinated Notes with previously owned foreign currency generally will recognise foreign currency gain or loss in an amount equal to any difference between the U.S. Noteholder's tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency at the spot rate on the date the Notes are purchased. A U.S. Noteholder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes generally will realise an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale. A U.S. Noteholder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. dollar amount realised. Any gain or loss realised by a U.S. Noteholder on a subsequent conversion of the foreign currency for a different amount will be foreign currency gain or loss.,p,
Transfer and Other Reporting Requirements,h3,

"In addition, a U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that is recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) that owns (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer (and each officer or director of the Issuer that is a U.S. citizen or resident) may be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471. A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes generally is required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it owns (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes or other interest that could be recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) should consult with their own tax advisors regarding whether they are required to file IRS Form 8886 in respect of this transaction. Such filing generally will be required if such investors file U.S. federal income tax returns or U.S. federal information returns and recognise losses in excess of a specified threshold. Such filing will also generally be required by a U.S. Noteholder of the Subordinated Notes if the Issuer both participates in certain types of transactions that are treated as ""reportable transactions,"" such as a transaction in which its loss exceeds a specified threshold, and either (x) such U.S. Noteholder owns 10 per cent. or more of the aggregate amount of the Subordinated Notes and makes a QEF Election with respect to the Issuer or (y) the Issuer is treated as a CFC and such U.S. Noteholder is a ""U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder"" (as defined above) of the Issuer. If the Issuer does participate in a reportable transaction and a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes requests information relating to such transaction, the Issuer will make reasonable efforts to provide such information as soon as practicable (such information to be provided at the Issuer's expense).",p,
"Certain U.S. Noteholders will be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold them in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other ""specified foreign financial assets"" exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or exceeds $75,000 at any time during the tax year. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Noteholder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.",p,
A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Noteholder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer's outstanding equity.,p,

U.S. Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Noteholders of Notes,h3,
"Subject to the discussions below under ""Information Reporting and Backup Withholding"", payments, including interest, OID and any amounts treated as dividends, on a Note to a non-U.S. Noteholder and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note by a non-U.S. Noteholder, will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless (a) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such non-",p,
"U.S. Noteholder in the United States; or (b) in the case of federal income tax imposed on gain, such non-U.S. Noteholder is a non-resident alien individual who holds a Note as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.",p,
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,h3,
"The amount of interest and principal paid or accrued on the Notes, and the proceeds from the sale of a Note, in each case, paid within the United States or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman to a U.S. person (other than a corporation or other exempt recipient) will be reported to the IRS. Under the Code, a U.S. person may be subject, under certain circumstances, to ""backup withholding tax"" with respect to interest and principal on a Note or the gross proceeds from the sale of a Note paid within the United States or by a U.S. middleman or United States payor to a U.S. Person. Backup withholding tax generally applies only if the U.S. person: (a) fails to furnish its social security or other taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after the request therefore; (b) furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (c) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report interest OID or dividends; or (d) fails, under certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding tax for failure to report interest and dividend payments.",p,
"Non-U.S. Noteholders or, in certain cases, their beneficial owners may be required to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. Noteholders in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding tax.",p,
"Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding collected from a payment will be allowed as a credit against the recipient's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the recipient to a refund, so long as the required information is properly furnished to the IRS. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers about any additional reporting requirements that may arise as a result of their purchasing, holding or disposing of Notes.",p,
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER'S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.,p,
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,h3,
"Pursuant to FATCA, a ""foreign financial institution"" may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (""foreign passthru payments"") to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer expects to be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. Additionally under existing U.S.",p,
"Treasury Regulations, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of U.S. Collateral Obligations was to take effect on 1 January 2019; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, which may be currently relied upon, would eliminate FATCA withholding on such types of payments. A number of jurisdictions (including Ireland) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (""IGAs""), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to two years after the date on which final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining ""foreign passthru payments"" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register and Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining ""foreign passthru payments"" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be ""grandfathered"" for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified after such date. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.",p,
"Each Noteholder may be required to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and its owners (or beneficial owners) in order to enable the Issuer (or an Intermediary) to identify and report on the Noteholder and certain of the Noteholder's direct and indirect U.S. beneficial owners to the IRS or a Dutch authority. Further, the Noteholder will be required to permit the Issuer to share such information with the relevant taxing authority. Although certain exceptions to these disclosure requirements could apply, each Noteholder should assume that if it fails to provide the required information or otherwise prevents the Issuer from complying with FATCA, the Issuer generally have the right to force the sale of the Noteholder's Notes (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value).",p,
"FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form.",p,
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,h3,
"ERISA imposes certain requirements on ""employee benefit plans"" subject thereto, on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, ""ERISA Plans""), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.",p,
"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, ""Plans"" ) and certain persons (referred to as ""parties in interest"" under ERISA or ""disqualified persons"" under the Code (collectively, ""Parties in Interest"")) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.",p,
"Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.",p,
"Under ERISA and regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, and applicable guidance (the ""Plan Asset Regulation"" )), if a Plan invests in an ""equity interest"" of an entity that is neither a ""publicly offered security"" nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan's assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an ""operating company,"" as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets (direct or indirect) of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Portfolio Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a ""Controlling Person""), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the ""25 per cent. Limitation""). A ""Benefit Plan Investor"" means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan or plan's investment in such entity.",p,
"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries, Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an ""equity interest"" as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and, to a greater extent, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may be considered ""equity interests"" for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors and Controlling Persons in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations",p,
"made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class) at all times (excluding, for purposes of such calculation, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under ""Transfer Restrictions"" below. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with the 25 per cent. Limitation.",p,
"Each of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, a Portfolio Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more, Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, a Portfolio Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,
"Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (""PTCE"" ) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent ""qualified professional asset managers""), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain ""in-house asset managers"").

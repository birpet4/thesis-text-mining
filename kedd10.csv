Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular: (a) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (b) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (c) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (d) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (e) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (f) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes.

Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if market emergencies occur.

Negative economic trends nationally as well as in specific geographic areas of the United States could result in an increase in loan defaults and delinquencies. An inability of obligors to obtain refinancing (particularly as high levels of required refinancings approach) may result in an economic decline that could delay or derail an economic recovery and cause a deterioration in loan performance generally.,p,"{'Title': 0.002485861536115408, 'Paragraph': 0.9975141286849976}"

Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.

"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of the current economic conditions. These risks could include, among others: (a) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market; (b) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price; and (c) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their stated Maturity Date. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Investment Manager to invest and, ultimately, the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,"{'Title': 0.0021450386848300695, 'Paragraph': 0.9978548884391785}"

The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer.

"In addition, the current liquidity crisis has adversely affected the primary market for a number of financial products, including leveraged loans, which may reduce opportunities for the Issuer to purchase new issuances of Collateral Debt Obligations. The ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loan arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs and the ability of the Issuer to purchase such assets may be partially or significantly limited. In Europe, primary leveraged loan activity has been limited and as such the ability of the Issuer to find suitable obligations to invest in may be limited.

"If it is required to do so in order to avoid FATCA withholding, the Issuer expects to enter into an IRS Agreement. Under the terms of such an agreement, the Issuer is expected to be obliged to comply with certain withholding tax obligations imposed on payments made to certain FFIs that fail to enter into an IRS Agreement and holders that fail to provide Noteholder FATCA Information to the Issuer that would enable the Issuer to comply with its own information reporting obligations (such Noteholders, “Recalcitrant Noteholders”). As such, the Issuer will be obliged to withhold tax at a 30 per cent. rate on certain “passthru payments” made to Recalcitrant Noteholders. Such withholding would begin no earlier than 1 January 2017. Preliminary guidance that was not included in the final regulations suggested that a payment on a Note will be treated as a passthru payment to the extent of (i) the amount (if any) of the payment that is treated as U.S. source payments plus (ii) the remainder of the payment multiplied by a ratio equal to the Issuer’s average U.S. assets to its average total assets, determined as of specified testing dates.

Although the final regulations do not contain the above formulation, the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has indicated that rules defining foreign passthru payments (clause (ii) of the definition above) will be issued at a later date.

"Credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations represent the rating agencies’ opinions regarding their credit quality and are not a guarantee of quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Debt Obligations and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a rating assigned to any Collateral Debt Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Debt Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Debt Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Debt Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations included in or similar to the Collateral Debt Obligations will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward. See “Risk Factors – Relating to the Notes - Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes”.",p,"{'Title': 0.0008991602808237076, 'Paragraph': 0.999100923538208}"

The Investment Manager also will not disclose to any of these parties the contents of any notice it receives pursuant to the Collateral Debt Obligations or related documents unless required to do so pursuant to the Trust Deed or the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document. In particular, the Investment Manager will not have any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligations, except as may be required in connection with the regular reports prepared by the Issuer (or the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trust Deed.",p,"{'Title': 0.0005974566447548568, 'Paragraph': 0.9994025230407715}"

"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to the Noteholders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.

"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial work out negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, an extension of the maturity and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,"{'Title': 0.0024061633739620447, 'Paragraph': 0.9975938200950623}"

"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions.

There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid.

"S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Investment Manager on or before the Issue Date. The CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Debt Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,"{'Title': 0.0010151786264032125, 'Paragraph': 0.9989847540855408}"
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,"{'Title': 0.0005881189717911184, 'Paragraph': 0.999411940574646}"

"Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. section 2510.3 101, the “Plan Asset Regulation”), as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA, if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Investment Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.",p,"{'Title': 0.0023821035865694284, 'Paragraph': 0.9976179003715515}"
"Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain.

Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent.

"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt.

"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,"{'Title': 0.002251668367534876, 'Paragraph': 0.9977483153343201}"
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral.

"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes.",p,"{'Title': 0.001030054991133511, 'Paragraph': 0.9989699125289917}"

The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer.

"There has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (COVID-19)) (“COVID-19”), that was first detected in December 2019 and which has now been found in over 200 countries globally. This outbreak and measures being put in place to restrict its spread have disrupted (and may continue to disrupt) economies and slowed (and may continue to slow) economic growth both in countries where the outbreak has been detected and in others. This may result, and in some cases (including in respect of the United Kingdom) has resulted, in the downgrade of certain sovereign credit ratings by certain rating agencies. This has (and may continue to) materially and adversely impact the global supply chain, market and economies. At this time, it remains uncertain whether the outbreak can be contained and what its impact will be in different affected areas, or how disruptive such outbreak and preventive measures may be to the global and regional economies. This state of affairs is causing (and may continue to cause) significant uncertainty in both domestic and global financial markets, has led to (and may continue to cause) volatility and disruption in the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on certain Obligors of Collateral Obligations. These additional risks and market disruptions may materially and adversely affect the ability of Obligors to make payments under Collateral Obligations, the liquidity and value of the Notes, the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations (see 4.20 “Ratings on Collateral Obligations”), the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes and the Issuer’s ability to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations.",p,"{'Title': 0.0015649162232875824, 'Paragraph': 0.9984350800514221}"
"In particular, rating actions (including, in respect of the potential downgrade of ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations, such ratings being downgraded between the date of this Offering Circular and the Issue Date) may result in the Initial Ratings of any Class of Rated Notes published by the Rating Agencies being lower than is described in this Offering Circular. Furthermore, any such rating actions taken between the Issue Date and the Effective Date could result in (a) a downgrade of one of more Classes of Rated Notes from their Initial Ratings and (b) certain Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests not being satisfied as at the Effective Date, resulting in an Effective Date Rating Event and following which the applicable Rated Notes may be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) (see also 4.6 “Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period”). If any rating assigned to the Notes is subject to a downgrade, the market value of the Notes may reduce and holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount (see also 3.16 “Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope”).",p,"{'Title': 0.0022809423971921206, 'Paragraph': 0.9977189898490906}"

"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high-yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,"{'Title': 0.0015457042027264833, 'Paragraph': 0.9984543323516846}"

Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks.

As a result, depending on the final trade arrangements to be put in place, substantial amendments to English law may occur and may diverge from the corresponding provisions of EU law applicable after the Transition Period.

"Following the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and proposed revisions to the securitisation framework including increasing risk weights for asset backed securities. Basel III provided for a substantial strengthening of prior prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) required legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions.

The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,"{'Title': 0.0015152047853916883, 'Paragraph': 0.9984847903251648}"

The JFSA Securitization Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitization exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitization, including the establishment and utilization of a due diligence system for evaluating securitized products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitization transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitization Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organization of the securitized product”, retains at least 5% of the securitized exposures.

The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements should not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its directors, officers or employees to register with the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CPO or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,"{'Title': 0.0015909805661067367, 'Paragraph': 0.9984090924263}"
"In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs.

Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer.

The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.

In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were ipso facto clauses which, in the absence of safe harbour protection, are unenforceable under the Code. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s holding that priority of distribution was a part of the liquidation of a swap agreement and therefore protected by the Code’s safe harbour provisions was affirmed on appeal by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on 14 March 2018 (Lehman Bros.

"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds.

A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer.

"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was to be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law. Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. Ireland previously notified the Commission that it intended to derogate from the interest limitation rules meaning the provisions of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on interest deductibility may be deferred in the case of Ireland until potentially 1 January 2024. However, the Department of Finance in its “Corporate Tax – Tax Strategy Group 20/03” paper dated September 2020 has indicated its intention to include final legislation dealing with the interest limitation rule in Finance Bill 2021, to take effect from 1 January 2022. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU Member States and third countries (“Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny (or, in some circumstances, delay) deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 applies as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.

The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS.

If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States.

In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities.

"During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy as at the Effective Date each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests (other than paragraph (m) thereof) and Target Par Amount requirement. See 4.1 (“The Portfolio”). The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,"{'Title': 0.0014139808481559157, 'Paragraph': 0.9985860586166382}"

4.7 Characteristics and Risks relating to the Portfolio,p,"{'Title': 0.002400837605819106, 'Paragraph': 0.997599184513092}"
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds), Unsecured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Unsecured Senior Loans and/or Unsecured Senior Bonds), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,"{'Title': 0.000900543644092977, 'Paragraph': 0.9990994930267334}"
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,"{'Title': 0.0025026299990713596, 'Paragraph': 0.9974973797798157}"
"The subordination levels of each of the Classes of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are “Defaulted Obligations”.",p,"{'Title': 0.0024938485585153103, 'Paragraph': 0.9975062012672424}"
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield bond, senior secured bond and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,"{'Title': 0.0005779327475465834, 'Paragraph': 0.9994220733642578}"

"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that, as of the Effective Date, at least 92.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations (which shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Investors should note that Secured Senior Obligations are defined as Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds and at least 70.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Loans. Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations (including such obligations that are Secured Senior Bonds) may not comprise more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount. Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively)",p,"{'Title': 0.0010885586962103844, 'Paragraph': 0.9989114999771118}"
"to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Secured Senior Obligations, and Unsecured Senior Obligations and, in some but not all cases, High Yield Bonds are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with the security claim in respect of Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. High Yield Bonds may represent a senior or subordinated claim, both in respect of security and of ranking of the debt claim represented thereby. Secured Senior Obligations and (to a lesser extent) High Yield Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Senior Obligations may be in the form of loans or a security, which may present different risks and concerns. Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Secured Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,"{'Title': 0.0021445630118250847, 'Paragraph': 0.9978553652763367}"

"Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond, Unsecured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond, Unsecured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer. See also 4.10 (“Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders”) in respect of the Issuer’s interest in syndicated loan facilities.",p,"{'Title': 0.001791278482414782, 'Paragraph': 0.99820876121521}"
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,"{'Title': 0.0020160386338829994, 'Paragraph': 0.9979839324951172}"
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable Underlying Instrument) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. However, in the case of EURIBOR, as of 3 December 2018, the calculation of two month and nine month EURIBOR was ceased. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,"{'Title': 0.0025377317797392607, 'Paragraph': 0.997462272644043}"
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders or bondholders,p,"{'Title': 0.00485996762290597, 'Paragraph': 0.9951400756835938}"
"to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans or bonds. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans, bonds and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan or bond may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees. In addition, Floating Rate Collateral Obligations are similar in nature to Cov-Lite Loans and typically do not provide for financial covenants and thus, may result in difficulties in triggering a default. See “Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks”.",p,"{'Title': 0.0010461515048518777, 'Paragraph': 0.9989538192749023}"

"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the Underlying Instrument relating to such Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such obligations has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk in the event that such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,"{'Title': 0.0018723398679867387, 'Paragraph': 0.9981276392936707}"

Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to their bondholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Senior Loan.",p,"{'Title': 0.0005099399131722748, 'Paragraph': 0.9994900226593018}"
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,"{'Title': 0.11906243860721588, 'Paragraph': 0.8809375762939453}"
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Loan and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,"{'Title': 0.002866738708689809, 'Paragraph': 0.9971332550048828}"
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Loans. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors,p,"{'Title': 0.00046592982835136354, 'Paragraph': 0.9995341300964355}"
Prepayment Risk,p,"{'Title': 0.04758715629577637, 'Paragraph': 0.9524127840995789}"
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or make whole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment.

Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative investment managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults.

"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity or an extension of its maturity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the Obligor continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation.

Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations.

"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,"{'Title': 0.0013388186926022172, 'Paragraph': 0.9986611604690552}"
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European High Yield Bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.21 (“Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations”) below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.",p,"{'Title': 0.0007628003950230777, 'Paragraph': 0.9992371797561646}"

"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the Underlying Instrument.

The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The Underlying Instrument usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the Underlying Instrument, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions.

"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of Participations and also require the limits set out in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the ratings of Selling Institutions to be satisfied. Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the Obligor under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the Obligor. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the applicable Underlying Instrument and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the Obligor and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the Obligor and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the Obligor sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the Underlying Instrument and the continuing creditworthiness of the Obligor. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by an Obligor.

"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of Obligors to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the Obligor or has assumed a degree of control over the Obligors resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the Obligors or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,"{'Title': 0.0018173418939113617, 'Paragraph': 0.9981826543807983}"

Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,"{'Title': 0.000542414141818881, 'Paragraph': 0.9994575381278992}"

"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,"{'Title': 0.0021175616420805454, 'Paragraph': 0.9978824257850647}"

The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating.

It should be noted that the Irish Regulations require the collection of information and filing of returns with the Irish Revenue Commissioners regardless as to whether the Issuer holds any U.S. assets or has any U.S. investors. However to the extent that the Notes are listed on a recognised stock exchange and regularly traded (i.e. listed with the intention that the interests may be traded) and/or are held in a recognised clearing system the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year.

The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address any other issue. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may result in the Issuer being subject to U.S. federal income tax, but may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) is permitted to take certain actions prohibited under the Tax Guidelines if it obtains written advice from Paul Hastings LLP or Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP or an opinion of other tax counsel of nationally recognised standing in the United States experienced in such matters, that the departure will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address those situations and there can be no assurances that any such opinion or advice of tax counsel will be consistent with Paul Hastings LLP’s current views and opinion standards. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager is not obliged to monitor (and in some cases, conform the Issuer’s activities in order to comply with) changes in law that could affect whether the Issuer is treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The Collateral Manager, if it does not have actual knowledge of a relevant change in law, might act in accordance with the Tax Guidelines notwithstanding the issuances of new decisions by the courts, new legislation or official guidance (regardless of whether such new interpretation, legislation or guidance would either merely increase the risk that the Issuer would be, or actually cause the Issuer to be, engaged in a U.S. trade or business). In addition, the opinion of Paul Hastings LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (notwithstanding that the Collateral Manager is acting in accordance with the Tax Guidelines).

If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. Because there is more than one class of Subordinated Notes, a U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain may exceed the amounts payable to the U.S. Holder on the Subordinated Notes during one or more taxable years.

In this regard, prospective purchasers of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is expected that the Collateral Obligations will include high-yield debt obligations and such instruments may have substantial OID, the cash payment of which may be deferred, perhaps for a substantial period of time. In addition, the Issuer may use proceeds from the sale of Collateral Obligations to retire other classes of Notes. As a result, in any given year, the Issuer may have substantial amounts of earnings for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are not distributed on the Subordinated Notes.

United States shareholders. For this purpose, a “10 per cent. United States shareholder” is any United States person that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of equity in the Issuer. Thus, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (and/or any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) possessing directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10 per cent. or more of the voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and, if applicable, any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) would be treated as a 10 per cent.

Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income. In general, for purposes of determining a 10 per cent. United States shareholder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s subpart F income, the amount of the Issuer’s subpart F income attributable to each class of Subordinated Notes will be the amount that bears the same ratio to the Issuer’s total subpart F income as (1) the earnings and profits that would be distributed with respect to that class if all of the Issuer’s earnings and profits were distributed on the last day of the Issuer’s taxable year on which the Issuer is a CFC bear to (2) the Issuer’s total earnings and profits for that taxable year.",p,"{'Title': 0.0012595383450388908, 'Paragraph': 0.9987404942512512}"

As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent.

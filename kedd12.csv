Negative economic trends nationally as well as in specific geographic areas of the United States could result in an increase in loan defaults and delinquencies.

Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Several countries have experienced or are currently experiencing a “double-dip” recession and there remains a risk of a “double-dip” recession in countries which have experienced modest growth over previous quarters and continued recession in countries which have not yet experienced positive growth since the onset of the global recession.,p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0002804590039886534}

"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of the current economic conditions. These risks could include, among others: (a) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market; (b) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price; and (c) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their stated Maturity Date. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Investment Manager to invest and, ultimately, the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.00033419160172343254}

The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer.

The ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loan arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs and the ability of the Issuer to purchase such assets may be partially or significantly limited. In Europe, primary leveraged loan activity has been limited and as such the ability of the Issuer to find suitable obligations to invest in may be limited.

These restrictions mean that the Issuer may be required to hold a Collateral Debt Obligation or and Eligible Investment or be precluded from acquiring a Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment when it would have sold such Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment or acquired such Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment, as applicable, had it based such determination on expected market value changes.

"The financial markets periodically experience substantial fluctuations in prices for obligations of the types that may be Collateral Debt Obligations and limited liquidity for such obligations. No assurance can be made that the conditions giving rise to such price fluctuations and limited liquidity will not occur, subsist or become more acute following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the ability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Investment Manager deems advantageous may be impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is either unable to dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices have risen or to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices are on the increase; the Investment Manager’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets will conversely cause their net asset value to decline as the value of unsold positions is marked to lower prices. A decrease in the Market Value of the Collateral Debt Obligations would also adversely affect the proceeds of sale that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Debt Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.

"Credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations represent the rating agencies’ opinions regarding their credit quality and are not a guarantee of quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Debt Obligations and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a rating assigned to any Collateral Debt Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Debt Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Debt Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Debt Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations included in or similar to the Collateral Debt Obligations will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward.

"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to the Noteholders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof.

"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial work out negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, an extension of the maturity and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon.

As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan.

There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments.

The CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Debt Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating.

"The Rated Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of a debt instrument over its “issue price”, if that excess equals or exceeds ¼ of 1 per cent. of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity or weighted average maturity in the case of instalment obligations (the “OID de minimis amount”). The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a debt instrument such as the Rated Notes is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Rated Note other than “qualified stated interest” payments. The “issue price” of a Rated Note generally is the first offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt instrument is sold.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.00032176889362744987}
"A U.S. Holder of a Rated Note that uses the accrual method of accounting or any U.S. Holder required to accrue OID will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of Euro interest or OID accrued during the accrual period. An accrual basis U.S. Holder with respect to such interest or any U.S. Holder with respect to OID, may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest or OID, as the case may be, using either of two methods, in either case regardless of whether the payments are in fact converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest or OID is translated at the average Euro rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder can elect to accrue interest or OID at the Euro spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the partial period within the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five business days of the receipt of such interest, the spot rate on the date of receipt of interest or OID. An election to accrue interest at the spot rate generally will apply to all foreign currency denominated debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a U.S. Holder may have additional foreign currency gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the Euro received. An accrual method U.S. Holder of a Rated Note or any U.S. Holder required to accrue OID will recognise foreign currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest or OID received to the extent that the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate on the date the interest or OID is received differs from the rate at which the interest or OID was accrued.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003260581870563328}
"If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument will be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument “CPDI”. Thus, if any class of the Rated Notes does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, a U.S. Holder would be required to report income in respect of such Notes in accordance with the CPDI regulations.

These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets.

A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003390274359844625}

The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer.

This outbreak and measures being put in place to restrict its spread have disrupted (and may continue to disrupt) economies and slowed (and may continue to slow) economic growth both in countries where the outbreak has been detected and in others. This may result, and in some cases (including in respect of the United Kingdom) has resulted, in the downgrade of certain sovereign credit ratings by certain rating agencies. This has (and may continue to) materially and adversely impact the global supply chain, market and economies. At this time, it remains uncertain whether the outbreak can be contained and what its impact will be in different affected areas, or how disruptive such outbreak and preventive measures may be to the global and regional economies. This state of affairs is causing (and may continue to cause) significant uncertainty in both domestic and global financial markets, has led to (and may continue to cause) volatility and disruption in the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on certain Obligors of Collateral Obligations. These additional risks and market disruptions may materially and adversely affect the ability of Obligors to make payments under Collateral Obligations, the liquidity and value of the Notes, the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations (see 4.20 “Ratings on Collateral Obligations”), the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes and the Issuer’s ability to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0002927394525613636}

Furthermore, any such rating actions taken between the Issue Date and the Effective Date could result in (a) a downgrade of one of more Classes of Rated Notes from their Initial Ratings and (b) certain Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests not being satisfied as at the Effective Date, resulting in an Effective Date Rating Event and following which the applicable Rated Notes may be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) (see also 4.6 “Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period”).

No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities.

"Following the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and proposed revisions to the securitisation framework including increasing risk weights for asset backed securities. Basel III provided for a substantial strengthening of prior prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) required legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the EU.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003011062799487263}

"to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0002993522211909294}

"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), 553 B.R. 476 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were ipso facto clauses which, in the absence of safe harbour protection, are unenforceable under the Code. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s holding that priority of distribution was a part of the liquidation of a swap agreement and therefore protected by the Code’s safe harbour provisions was affirmed on appeal by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on 14 March 2018 (Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), No. 17 CIV. 1224 (LGS), 2018 WL 1322225 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2018))",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0002801335067488253}

"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was to be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law. Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. Ireland previously notified the Commission that it intended to derogate from the interest limitation rules meaning the provisions of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on interest deductibility may be deferred in the case of Ireland until potentially 1 January 2024. However, the Department of Finance in its “Corporate Tax – Tax Strategy Group 20/03” paper dated September 2020 has indicated its intention to include final legislation dealing with the interest limitation rule in Finance Bill 2021, to take effect from 1 January 2022. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU Member States and third countries (“Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny (or, in some circumstances, delay) deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 applies as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.

"Historically, a similar position has been taken by the Netherlands. However, recent developments have changed this and, in February 2020, the Dutch tax authorities issued letters to participants in the Dutch CLO market explaining that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in the Netherlands with effect from 1 April 2019. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS. However, on 22 April 2020, the Dutch tax authorities subsequently provided written guidance confirming that, although collateral management and administration fees remain subject to VAT, this will not apply with retroactive effect.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0002970539208035916}

A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a “special investment fund” if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.00030126937781460583}

If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Collateral Management Fees. The standard VAT rate in Ireland is currently 23%.

"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States.

For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland.

The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest.

The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country.

As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is either unable to dispose of Collateral Obligations whose prices have risen or to acquire Collateral Obligations whose prices are on the increase; the Collateral Manager’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets will conversely cause the value of the Portfolio to decline as the value of unsold positions is marked to lower prices. A decrease in the value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the proceeds of sale that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.

See 4.1 (“The Portfolio”). The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003731675387825817}

"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the Underlying Instrument relating to such Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market.

"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders.

In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group.

The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the Obligors thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes, then by holders of the Class Z Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003347272577229887}

"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a S&P CCC Obligation or Moody’s Caa Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating in respect of a Collateral Obligation. In some instances, the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.0003188848204445094}
"based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, on a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Moody’s and/or S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different Rating Agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the Moody’s Rating is derived from an S&P Rating. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question.

These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity.

4.22 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,{'POSITIVE': 0.6987730264663696}
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of Obligors to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the Obligor or has assumed a degree of control over the Obligors resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the Obligors or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.00027890762430615723}

Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated.

4.23 Loan Repricing,p,{'POSITIVE': 0.37132370471954346}
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,{'POSITIVE': 0.00029146618908271194}

The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating.

The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address any other issue. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may result in the Issuer being subject to U.S. federal income tax, but may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) is permitted to take certain actions prohibited under the Tax Guidelines if it obtains written advice from Paul Hastings LLP or Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP or an opinion of other tax counsel of nationally recognised standing in the United States experienced in such matters, that the departure will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address those situations and there can be no assurances that any such opinion or advice of tax counsel will be consistent with Paul Hastings LLP’s current views and opinion standards. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager is not obliged to monitor (and in some cases, conform the Issuer’s activities in order to comply with) changes in law that could affect whether the Issuer is treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The Collateral Manager, if it does not have actual knowledge of a relevant change in law, might act in accordance with the Tax Guidelines notwithstanding the issuances of new decisions by the courts, new legislation or official guidance (regardless of whether such new interpretation, legislation or guidance would either merely increase the risk that the Issuer would be, or actually cause the Issuer to be, engaged in a U.S. trade or business). In addition, the opinion of Paul Hastings LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts.

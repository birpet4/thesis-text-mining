U.S. RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS,h2,title
"The U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) generally require the “sponsor”, either directly or through a “majority owned affiliate”, to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of a securitisation transaction. In the LSTA Decision (as defined below), the Panel (as defined below) held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Based on the LSTA Decision, no transaction party currently intends to obtain on the Issue Date and retain after the Issue Date any Notes for the purpose of satisfying the U.S. Risk Retention Rules nor will any transaction party seek to satisfy any other requirements (including with respect to disclosure) set forth in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.

"A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on either section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,p
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager or collateral manager, general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors or similar governing body of the “covered fund”.",p,p

"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of IM Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes or IM Non-Voting Notes are, in each case, disenfranchised in respect of any IM Removal Resolution or IM Replacement Resolution.

"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretive guidance on the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain (as defined in the Conditions), the Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,p
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes.

RISK FACTORS,h2,uncertain
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. The following risk factors are applicable to an investment in the Notes. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.",p,p

1. GENERAL COMMERCIAL RISKS,p,uncertain
1.1 General,p,uncertain
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Debt Obligations (and other financial assets) with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment) and Condition 11(b) (Enforcement). In particular, (i) payments in respect of the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the other Classes of Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
"None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Investment Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular or the Reports, as the case may be.",p,p

"In addition, the information contained in the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will be dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and the Investment Manager.

1.2 Suitability,p,title

1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,p,uncertain
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified and or pre-funded and/or secured.",p,p
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,p,uncertain
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,p
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,p,uncertain
"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.",p,p
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.,p,p
"As discussed further in 1.7 “European Union and Euro Zone Risk”, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,p
"In addition, Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations may be organised in, or otherwise Domiciled in, certain of such countries currently suffering from economic distress, or other countries that may begin to suffer economic distress, and the uncertainty and market instability in any such country may increase the likelihood of default by such Obligor. If any such Obligor, becomes insolvent, by virtue of being organised in such a jurisdiction or having a substantial percentage of its revenues or assets in such a jurisdiction, may be more likely to be subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in such jurisdiction at the same time as such jurisdiction is itself potentially unstable.",p,p
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis and the ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loans arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy outs may be partially or significantly limited. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to",p,p
"increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. A continuing decreased ability of obligors to obtain refinancing may result in an economic decline causing a deterioration in loan performance generally and defaults of Collateral Debt Obligations. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Investment Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,p
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,p
"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non- performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Debt Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Debt Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
"Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.",p,p
"The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Investment Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.",p,p
"While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors or whether such conditions or markets will deteriorate rather than improve.",p,p
"1.6 Illiquidity in the Collateralised Debt Obligation, Leveraged Finance and Fixed Income Markets may Affect the Noteholders",p,uncertain
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Debt Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer",p,p
"and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Debt Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Debt Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,p
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,p,uncertain
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,p
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,p
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,p
"Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the imposition of capital controls, the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time.

Article 50 provides for a two year period for such negotiations to take place (unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period in respect of which, please see below) (the “Article 50 Period”).",p,p

Investors should be aware that the Issuer’s risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the",p,p
"Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.

It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.",p,p
"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future EU-UK relationship, EU laws (other than those EU laws transposed into English law (see below)) will cease to apply within the UK pursuant to the terms and timing of a future withdrawal agreement. This would be achieved by the UK ceasing to be party to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by the parallel repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. Article 50 provides that the UK will cease to be a member of the EU from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, if a withdrawal agreement has not been concluded, two years after the notification under Article 50 was served, unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period (in respect of which, please see below).",p,p
"On 25 November 2018, a negotiated withdrawal agreement was endorsed by leaders at a special meeting of the European Council. The negotiated withdrawal agreement provided for a transition or implementation period, which would start on the date of entry into force of the agreement and end 21 months later, unless extended by a single decision for up to one or two years. The negotiated withdrawal agreement stated that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law would be applicable to and in the UK during the transition period.",p,p
"However, the UK government needs the approval of the UK Parliament in order to ratify the negotiated withdrawal agreement, which has not yet been forthcoming.",p,p
"In response to a second UK request to extend the Article 50 Period, on 11 April 2019 the European Council adopted its decision to extend the Article 50 Period until 31 October 2019.",p,p
"On 9 September 2019, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 received Royal Assent and passed into law. This legislation provided that if by 19 October 2019, either a deal had not been ratified by the UK Parliament or “no deal” had not been approved by the UK Parliament, the UK Government would be required to request from the EU an extension to the UK’s departure date to 31 January 2020 (or another date if the UK Parliament approved a date suggested by the EU). Although the UK Government and the EU reached an agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement on 17 October 2019, this revised deal had not been approved by the UK Parliament by 19 October 2019. On that day, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, the UK Government sent a request for a further extension to the Article 50 Period to the President of the EU Council. This request was accompanied, however, by a further communication indicating that the UK Government did not wish the EU to grant such an extension. On 28 October 2019, the European Council agreed to a further extension of the Article 50 Period until 31 January 2020.",p,p

"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to",p,p

Regulatory Risk,p,uncertain

"Currently, under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EU and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to how, following a UK exit from the EU, and probably the EEA (whatever the form thereof), the existing passporting regime will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of the UK’s exit and the terms of any replacement relationship, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may, on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.",p,p
"There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU will include arrangements for the continuation of the existing passporting regime or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes.

Market Risk,p,p

This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"Investors should be aware that the result of the Referendum and any subsequent negotiations, notifications, withdrawal and changes to legislation may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Investment Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,p
Exposure to Counterparties,p,uncertain
,p,td
"The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that if the UK does leave the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the result of the Referendum, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see 4.15 “Counterparty Risk”.",p,p
Ratings Actions,p,p

"Following the result of the Referendum, S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have each downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and each of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s has placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.",p,p
"The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, the recent downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating",p,p
"Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.",p,p
"While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see 4.15 “Counterparty Risk”.",p,p
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,p,uncertain
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Debt Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that the Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Corporate Services Provider and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to those amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests. In addition, service providers who are not paid in full, including the Directors may have the right to resign. This could ultimately lead to the Issuer being in default under the applicable laws of Ireland and potentially being removed from the register of companies and dissolved",p,p
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES,p,title
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,p
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis creating the potential for conflict across jurisdictions. Investors should be aware that risks posed by such regulatory overlap and divergence are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes, could be materially and adversely affected thereby.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, financial, regulatory, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences. Certain regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire the Notes, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the Notes who are not subject to those provisions to resell their Notes in the secondary market.",p,p

None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain, the Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor’s investment in the Notes).",p,p
2.1 Basel III and Basel IV,p,uncertain
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Directive 2009/138/EC framework in the European Union.",p,p
"In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks' RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,p
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, the Agents, the Trustee or any of their affiliates makes any representation or warranty to any such prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,p

Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors,p,p

"The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the CRR, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).",p,p

If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any applicable legal, regulatory or other requirement, then investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes. Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.

It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form by way of a website (see Description of the Reports). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date.

The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Transparency RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted revised Transparency RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019. The Commission adopted these revised Transparency RTS on 16 October 2019.

This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.",p,p

Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies the Transparency Requirements and none of the Issuer, BlueMountain, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy the Transparency Requirements.",p,p

In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.",p,p
Whether the Investment Manager will be able to obtain and provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the Transparency Requirements is unclear.,p,p
"Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator or BlueMountain (in each case, on behalf of the reporting entity), to fulfil the Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,p
"Investors should be aware that, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager will not be liable for, and will only indemnify the Issuer for, any failure by the Issuer to comply with the Transparency Requirements to the extent such failure results from gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) on the part of the Investment Manager.

"If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) BlueMountain as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on BlueMountain as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,p

"As regards the jurisdictional scope of the direct risk retention obligation, the Explanatory Memorandum to the original European Commission proposal for a Securitisation Regulation implied that the direct obligation would not apply where none of the originator, sponsor or original lender is established in the EU. The EBA confirmed this interpretation (in its “Feedback on the public consultation” section of its Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards published on 31 July 2018) where it said: “The EBA agrees however that a “direct” obligation should apply only to originators, sponsors and original lenders established in the EU as suggested by the Commission in the explanatory memorandum.” This EBA interpretation is, however, non-binding and not legally enforceable.",p,p

The EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements by an institution similar to BlueMountain.

U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,p
,p,td
"On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). On February 9, 2018, a three- judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Loan Syndicates and Trading Association in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (the “LSTA Decision”). The Panel’s opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on April 5, 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on April 3, 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof.",p,p
"As a result of the LSTA Decision, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules are not expected to apply to the transaction contemplated herein and no party to the transaction contemplated herein expects to be required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and none of the Investment Manager or its affiliates will have any obligation under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to hold Notes for any period of time.",p,p
"No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for the type of transaction contemplated herein (a “New Risk Retention Rule” and together with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, “U.S. Retention Regulations”), and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,p
"If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Retention Holder may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on BlueMountain, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.",p,p
"In the event that the U.S. Retention Regulations become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuer’s ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to the consent rights of BlueMountain with respect to each such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required under the Trust Deed with respect thereto, it should be expected that BlueMountain will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuers and/or any holders of Notes).",p,p
Recent developments concerning the treatment of CLOs for certain Japanese investors,p,p
,p,td
"On March 15, 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitization Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitization transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitization Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitization exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitization, including the establishment and utilization of a due diligence system for evaluating",p,p
"securitized products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitization transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitization Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organization of the securitized product,” retains at least 5% of the securitized exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitization Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5% retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitized exposures”).",p,p
The JFSA Securitization Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.,p,p
"The JFSA Securitization Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.",p,p
"Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining Subordinated Notes with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,p
"Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Debt Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed,” that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,p
"It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitization Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, BlueMountain, the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,p
2.3 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Investment Manager in Order to Comply with Risk Retention,p,uncertain
"The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in 2.2 “Risk Retention and Transparency Requirements – EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” is that affected Investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than 5 per cent. in the securitisation. The 5 per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the Aggregate Collateral Balance. The Retention Holder has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding (multiplied by the price at which such Subordinated Notes were purchased by the Retention Holder) being, at any time, an amount equal to no less than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance.",p,p
Certain discretions of the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in “BlueMountain and the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.,p,p
The Issuer may not issue further Notes without (a) the Retention Holder consenting to such issuance and,p,p
(b) such additional issuance not resulting in non-compliance by the Retention Holder with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.,p,uncertain
"As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Investment Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.",p,p
2.4 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),p,uncertain
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds see 2.5 “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive”, credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are “non-financial counterparties” (or third country entities equivalent to “financial counterparties” or “non-financial counterparties”).",p,p
"Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”), and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the “margin requirement”). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a financial counterparty, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements or restricting of their terms.",p,p
"Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group”, excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,p
"Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards. Whilst regulatory technical standards have been published in respect of certain classes of OTC derivative contracts, others are yet to be proposed.",p,p
Clearing Obligation,p,p
,p,td
"The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under “Category 1”) to 21 December 2018 (for non- financial counterparties that are not AIFs grouped under “Category 4”).",p,p
Margin Requirements,p,p
,p,td
"On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the “RTS”). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.",p,p
"The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin.",p,p
"If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Investment Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.",p,p
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.,p,p
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to amend the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in future.",p,p
"Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non- financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Asset Swap Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Investment Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,p
"Prospective investors should also be aware that on 4 May 2017, the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation amending EMIR as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (“EMIR REFIT”). The final version of EMIR REFIT was published in the EU Official Journal on 28 May 2019, with the majority of the amendments to EMIR coming into force from 17 June 2019.",p,p
"The most significant amendment in EMIR REFIT is the change to the definition of financial counterparty (“FC”). EMIR REFIT brings into that definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”). Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be non-financial counterparties (“NFCs”) if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds would be out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs. Under the amended definition of a FC in EMIR REFIT, such funds will now be regarded as TCEs that would be FCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that EU FCs will be required to ensure compliance with the clearing obligation and margin requirements for uncleared derivatives in respect of their trading with such funds.",p,p
"Despite the initial proposal by the European Commission including securitisation special purpose entities (“SSPEs”, defined by reference to the AIFMD) in the revised financial counterparty definition, the final version published in the Official Journal instead provides a specific exclusion for such entities from categorisation as a financial counterparty.",p,p
"EMIR REFIT also amends the clearing obligation through the introduction of a new category of “small financial counterparty”, subject to similar clearing thresholds as non-financial counterparties. Another amendment provides that where the clearing threshold has been exceeded by a non-financial counterparty in one asset category, that non-financial counterparty will only have to clear derivatives in that category, rather than for all asset categories (as was the case in the original EMIR). Other amendments in EMIR REFIT include a relaxation of the reporting requirements for non-financial counterparties below the clearing threshold, the imposition of a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms” access standard for clearing members providing clearing services and new powers for ESMA and the Commission to suspend the clearing obligation for certain classes of derivative.",p,p
2.5 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,p,uncertain
"AIFMD introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of AIFs. If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Investment Manager is not authorised under AIFMD. If considered to be an AIF managed by an AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR REFIT all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also 2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”.",p,p
"There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “SSPEs” (the “SSPE Exemption”). ESMA has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, “registered financial vehicle corporations” with the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation, or appoint an AIFM unless the Central Bank of Ireland issues further guidance advising them to do so.",p,p
"If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Investment Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.",p,p
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.",p,p
"If the Issuer were to be considered an AIF and an AIFM were to be appointed to manage the Issuer’s assets, such AIFM would need to comply with a number of requirements under AIFMD, including the appointment of a custodian in respect of the Issuer’s assets and compliance with certain reporting and disclosure obligations. Compliance with AIFMD by any such AIFM appointed by the Issuer will involve significant additional costs which may affect the return Noteholders receive from their investment.",p,p
2.6 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,p,title
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Investment Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and",p,p
"adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Investment Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.",p,p
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,p
"None of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,p
2.7 CFTC Regulations,p,uncertain
"Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States (including the CFTC) have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including: (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility,",p,p
"(ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps and (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Investment Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Debt Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Investment Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,p
"Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of initial and variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but have yet to become effective. It is expected that such regulations will become effective in the next two years, but the SEC has yet to set a compliance date. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post initial or variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.",p,p
2.8 Commodity Pool Regulation,p,title
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and the Investment Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool”",p,p
"under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA), provided that any such agreement either (i) complies with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time of entry into such agreement or (ii) the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable international legal counsel knowledgeable in such matters to the effect that the entry into such arrangement would not require any of the Issuer, its Directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association (“NFA”) with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA (the “Hedging Condition”). No assurance can be given that a Hedge Agreement which complies with the Hedging Condition (including one that complies with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria) will not cause the Issuer, its Directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC and/or the NFA with respect to the Issuer. If there is any change in the applicable rules and regulations in the future, the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria may need to be reviewed and revised by reputable international legal counsel at such time.",p,p
"If trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Investment Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5 per cent. of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100 per cent. of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Investment Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Investment Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Investment Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Investment Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.",p,p
"Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Investment Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Investment Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Investment Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.",p,p
"Further, if the Investment Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Investment Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Investment Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Investment Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Investment Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,p

"(i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.",p,p
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,p
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.",p,p
"The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of IM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or IM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any IM Removal Resolution or IM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.",p,p
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any IM Removal Resolutions or IM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in ensuring that investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other “banking entities” subject to the Volcker Rule are not characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer",p,p
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,p
"Earlier this year, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitisations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule’s covered fund provisions. It is unclear at this time what changes ultimately will be made to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Investment Manager.",p,p
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.,p,p

Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,p

"The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.",p,p
"It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.",p,p

The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.",p,p
"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised",p,p

EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively.",p,p
"Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.",p,p
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):,p,uncertain

"if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fall-back mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, if a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes;",p,p

The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer. There will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction due to the application of any FTT and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.",p,p
"Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT.",p,p
"On 10 October 2016, following a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the ten remaining Participating Member States, it was reported that an agreement in principle had been reached on certain key aspects of the FTT and that the EU Commission had consequently been asked to prepare draft FTT legislation on the basis of that agreement. However, the details of the FTT remain to be agreed. A written answer given by Pierre Moscovici in the European Parliament, speaking on behalf of the Commission on 28 April 2017, confirmed that negotiations between Participating Member States on the Commission’s proposal are continuing with a number of key areas still open for discussion, although the Commission’s intention was to assist Participating Member States reaching a compromise agreement during the course of 2017.

The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,p
"The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” (“LOB”) rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.",p,p
"The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.",p,p
Consequences of a denial of treaty benefits,p,p

The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.",p,p
"The United Kingdom and Ireland signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and Ireland is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 June 2018 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 January 2019 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019.",p,p
"Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument, the United Kingdom and Ireland each deposited a final list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument, Action 6 will be implemented into the double tax treaty Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom (as well as into the other CTAs Ireland has with other jurisdictions which have ratified the Multilateral Instrument) by the inclusion of a PPT.",p,p

A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax",p,p

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was due to be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.",p,p
"Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Debt Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain.",p,p
"On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU Member States and third countries (“Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either delay deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 needs to be implemented in the EU Member States’ national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and will have to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.",p,p

Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS and the CRS (and DAC II) have been implemented into Irish law by sections 89IF and 89IG and regulations made thereunder with effect from 1 January 2016.,p,uncertain
"Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 50 countries, including Ireland and all EU Members States (known as the “Early Adopter Group”) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.",p,p
"Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.",p,p
"The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance,",p,p
"(iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.",p,p
2.19 Regulated Banking Activity,p,uncertain
"In many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,p
"Collateral Debt Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or",p,p
"agency, payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,p
2.20 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,p,uncertain
"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.",p,p
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,p
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.",p,p
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,p
2.21 U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts,p,uncertain
"U.S. regulators have adopted final rules and interpretative guidance setting forth limitations on certain insolvency-related default rights of parties to certain “qualified financial contracts” (“QFCs”) entered into with counterparties that have been designated as systemically important, along with certain of such entities’ subsidiaries and affiliates (each, a “Covered Entity”). Such rules and guidance (the “QFC Stay Rules”) generally require: (i) the Covered Entity to ensure that any stays imposed as a result of the entry of such entity into certain liquidation proceedings are contractually acknowledged by the counterparty to the QFC (in particular, where the relevant QFC is governed by non-U.S. law and/or the counterparty is located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction); and (ii) the Covered Entity to not agree in its QFCs to certain types of cross-defaults that are related, directly or indirectly, to the entry into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding of certain affiliates of the Covered Entity. If a Covered Entity enters into a contract with the Issuer that is subject to the QFC Stay Rules, the Covered Entity will be responsible for ensuring that such QFC complies with the QFC Stay Rules. As a result of the application of such rules, the Issuer may be required to accept limitations in its insolvency-related default rights against the Covered Entity.",p,p
2.22 Centre of Main Interests,p,uncertain
"The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), the Issuer’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.",p,p
"As the Issuer’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute “proof to the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties” would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.",p,p
"As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.",p,p
2.23 Irish Value Added Tax on Investment Management Fees,p,uncertain
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish law, the Investment Management Fees should be exempt from value added tax in Ireland as these should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a “qualifying company” for the purposes of Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (the “TCA”). This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the “Directive”), which provides that EU member states shall exempt the management of “special investment funds” as defined by EU member states. The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 of Ireland, in the provisions implementing Article 135(1)(g) of the Directive, specifically lists, in the categories of undertakings to whom supplies of management services are exempt from VAT, undertakings which are “qualifying companies” for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA. The Issuer has been advised that it will be such a “qualifying company”, therefore management services supplied to it are exempt from value added tax in Ireland under current law. On 9 December 2015 the European Court of Justice handed down its judgment in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13 which concerned Dutch law on value added tax, in particular the Dutch interpretation of the term “special investment fund” under the Directive.",p,p
The court made some general observations about Article 135(1)(g) regarding EU member states’ discretion to define the undertakings to which Article 135(1)(g) applies in their own jurisdictions. It is possible that in the future there could be changes to the way that EU member states apply this exemption for their local purposes. No such changes have been announced in Ireland.,p,p
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES,p,p
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,uncertain
"Currently, no market exists for the Notes. Neither the Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) is under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of the Notes. Over the past few years, Notes issued in securitisation transactions have experienced historically high volatility and significant fluctuations in market value. Additionally, some potential buyers of such Notes now view securitisation products as an inappropriate investment, thereby reducing the number of potential buyers and/or potentially affecting liquidity in the secondary market. Noteholders must therefore be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,p
IM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into IM Voting Notes or IM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which IM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for IM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the IM Non-Voting Notes and the IM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.,p,p
"3.2 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty or the Trustee.",p,uncertain
"None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty, the Trustee or any Affiliate thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any Noteholder of ownership of the Notes, and no Noteholder may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each Noteholder will be required to represent (or, in the case of certain non-certificated Notes, deemed to represent) to the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser, among other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is within its powers and authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly authorised by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.",p,p
3.3 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,p,uncertain
"The market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,p
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,p

"in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing involving the issuance of replacement Rated Notes, the consent of the Investment Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).",p,p
,p,td
"As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions, at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders (but subject to the consent of the Investment Manager where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing involving the issuance of replacement Rated Notes), Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class (or, if applicable, an entire tranche or tranches of a Class of Rated Notes). Where any Partial Redemption Date is not a Payment Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid on such date in an amount equal to: (a) the lesser of: (i) the amount of accrued interest on the Class or Classes of Rated Notes being refinanced or redeemed; and (ii) the amount the Investment Manager reasonably determines would have been available for distribution under the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments for the payment of accrued interest on the Class or Classes of Rated Notes being refinanced or redeemed on the immediately following Payment Date (or, in the case of a Partial Redemption Date that is occurring on a Payment Date, on such date) if such Notes had not been refinanced or redeemed; plus (b) if the Partial Redemption Date is not a Payment Date, the amount the Investment Manager reasonably determines would have been available for distribution under the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments for the payment of Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses on the immediately following Payment Date. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).",p,p
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Subordinated Notes. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,p
"The Investment Manager may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.",p,p
"If there is an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Investment Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.",p,p
"Where Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new Notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing. In addition, a Refinancing may result in a Class of Rated Notes having a shorter maturity date than other Classes of Rated Notes.",p,p
3.5 The Trust Deed requires mandatory redemption of the Rated Notes for failure to satisfy Coverage Tests or if an Effective Date Rating Event occurs,p,p
"If on any relevant Determination Date any applicable Coverage Test is not met with respect to any Class or Classes of Rated Notes, or an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing, Interest Proceeds that otherwise would have been paid or distributed to the Noteholders of each Class of Rated Notes (other than Class A Notes and Class B Notes) that is subordinated to such Class or Classes and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise have been reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations will instead be used to redeem the Rated Notes of the most senior Class or Classes then Outstanding, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable Coverage Tests or until such Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing. This could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the payments of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, and/or the Subordinated Notes, as the case may be. In addition, a mandatory redemption of Rated Notes owing to an Effective Date Rating Event could result in the Investment Manager causing the Issuer to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.",p,p
3.6 The Notes are Subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Investment Manager,p,uncertain
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) certifies to the Trustee that it has been unable, after using reasonable endeavours, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, comply with the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,p
3.7 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early,p,uncertain
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following an Event of Default; (b) an Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Notes by liquidation of the Portfolio in accordance with the Conditions; or (c) the Investment Manager reasonably believes and notifies the Issuer and the Trustee that it is unable to reinvest in additional Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.,p,p
3.8 The Investment Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period,p,uncertain
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,p

"At any time, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Retention Holder, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes of one or more of the existing Classes (other than the Class X Notes) and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Debt Obligations.

The Investment Manager may use funds in the Contribution Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Investment Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Any Noteholder may make Contributions to the Contribution Account pursuant to Condition 2(l) (Contributions) from time to time.,p,p
"Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent an Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see 3.17 “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations”).",p,p
3.10 Limited Recourse Obligations,p,title
"The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of BlueMountain, the Noteholders of any Class, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, the Corporate Services Provider or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of BlueMountain, the Noteholders, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge",p,p

3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,p,uncertain
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.",p,p

Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders.

Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,p
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Calculation Agent is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Floating Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Floating Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Floating Rate of Interest on any other basis.",p,p

3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments,p,uncertain
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be an Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,p
"As described above, failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes (in each case even where such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class), will not be an Event of Default. Holders of such Classes of Notes will consequently have no right to accelerate their Notes or to direct that the Trustee take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral to recover the principal amount of their Notes outstanding in such circumstances.",p,p
"Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,p
3.15 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited,p,uncertain
"The Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, in consultation with and based on certain information provided to it by the Investment Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,p
3.16 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,p,uncertain
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Rated Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Rated Notes and the market value of such Rated Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,p
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate Notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,p
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the",p,p
"occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Rated Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, Noteholders may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral Debt Obligations (including by restricting the ability of the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer to undertake discretionary sales of Collateral Debt Obligations, or to reinvest Sale Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, in each case due to the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period following a downgrade or withdrawal of ratings in relation to certain of the Rated Notes). Please see “The Portfolio” and “Ratings of the Notes”.",p,p
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3.

Rating Agencies may refuse to give Rating Agency Confirmations,p,p
,p,td
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by Noteholders.",p,p
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Investment Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if either Rating Agency has not yet confirmed or been deemed to have confirmed its initial ratings of the applicable Rated Notes, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,p

"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,",p,p
"(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.",p,p
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating",p,uncertain
"Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,p
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,p
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.,p,p

"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,p
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,p,uncertain
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling in January 2033 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Debt Obligations. Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Debt Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing",p,p
of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.,p,p
"3.18 Projections, Forecasts and Estimates are Forward Looking Statements and are Inherently Uncertain",p,uncertain
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Debt Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; and mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Debt Obligations. None of the Issuer, BlueMountain, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,p
3.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,p,uncertain
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of an Event of Default on or about that date.",p,p
3.20 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,p,uncertain
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,p
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinated Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Debt Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinated Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinated Classes of Rated Notes. See",p,p
3.5 “The Trust Deed requires mandatory redemption of the Rated Notes for failure to satisfy Coverage Tests or if an Effective Date Rating Event occurs” above.,p,p
"Issuer expenses (including Investment Management Fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to any particular Class of Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,p

However, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 9 (Taxation), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.",p,p
"If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,p
"If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of either of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,p
3.22 Book entry Holders are not Considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed and may Delay Receipt of Payments on the Notes,p,uncertain
"Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.",p,p
"Noteholders owning a book entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See “Form of the Notes”.",p,p

Clearing Systems,p,uncertain
,p,td
"Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio was created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which, in relation to the Collateral Debt Obligations that are held through the Custodian, took effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Debt Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement which",p,p
may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities if the Custodian or its sub-custodian becomes insolvent.,p,uncertain
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.",p,p
Fixed Security,p,p

"Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,p
"3.24 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",p,uncertain
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,p
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,p
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.",p,p
Any Notes held by the Investment Manager and any Investment Manager Related Person shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights in connection with the removal of the Investment Manager and as otherwise described in the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.,p,p
"If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. The voting threshold at any Noteholders’ meeting in respect of an Ordinary Resolution or an Extraordinary Resolution of all Noteholders is, respectively, more than 50 per cent. or at least 66⅔ per cent. of the votes cast on such resolution. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class",p,p
"or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, if a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.",p,p
"Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of IM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders.

Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to an Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Investment Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected",p,p

U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective qualified electing fund election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.

3.30 Flip Clauses,p,uncertain
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual Priorities of Payment which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,p
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,p
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,p
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,p
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,p
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,p
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL,p,p
4.1 The Portfolio,p,uncertain
"The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Investment Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Debt Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as of the Issue Date and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Debt Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Investment Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,p
"Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, BlueMountain, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.",p,p
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager is required to carry out due diligence as it considers reasonably necessary in accordance with the standard of care specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Debt Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder (other than in relation to Participations where the Issuer will be the beneficial owner only) of such Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Investment Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Debt Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.",p,p
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,uncertain
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds as well as certain other investments lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,p
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair,p,p
"the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.",p,uncertain
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,p
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Debt Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations (subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions).",p,p
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Debt Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub- investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Debt Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,p
"The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Investment Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor’s participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Investment Manager or the Initial Purchaser would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Investment Manager or the Initial Purchaser and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Investment Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Initial Purchaser has not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.",p,p
4.3 Prepayment Risk,p,title
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In",p,p
"addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made. The rate of prepayments, amortisation and defaults may be influenced by various factors including:",p,p
(a) changes in Obligor performance and requirements for capital;,p,p
(b) the level of interest rates;,p,uncertain
(c) lack of credit being extended and/or the tightening of credit underwriting standards in the commercial lending industry; and,p,uncertain
"(d) the overall economic environment, including any fluctuations in the recovery from the current economic conditions.",p,uncertain
"The Issuer cannot predict the actual rate of prepayments, accelerated amortisation or defaults which will be experienced with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations. As a result, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for any investor that requires a regular or predictable schedule of principal payments.",p,p
Bonds frequently have call or redemption features (with or without a premium or make whole) that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date.,p,p
"Repayments on bonds may be caused by a variety of factors which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such repayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a repayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and may be acquired in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by holders of the Notes and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,p
4.4 Defaults and Recoveries,p,uncertain
"The Collateral Debt Obligations will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in non- investment grade loans and bonds, which are subject to liquidity, market value, credit, interest rate, reinvestment and certain other risks. It is anticipated that the Collateral Debt Obligations generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade corporate obligations. These risks could be exacerbated to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in one or more particular types of Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"Prices of the Collateral Debt Obligations may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, prevailing credit spreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The current uncertainty affecting the European economy and the economies of countries in which issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the value and performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations. Additionally, loans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organised exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customised, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the debt securities market.",p,p
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Obligations (“Senior",p,uncertain
"Obligations”), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,p
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Secured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative investment managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,p
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors (including any such analysis prepared by the Initial Purchaser for or at the direction of investors) in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,p
"In some European jurisdictions (including the UK), obligors or lenders may seek a “scheme of arrangement”. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms.",p,p

4.5 The Warehouse Arrangements,p,uncertain
"It is expected that at least €297,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations will have been acquired (or committed to be acquired) pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements (as defined below) (including over 5.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount which comprise of assets originated by BlueMountain for risk retention purposes in accordance with the Risk Retention Letter) as of the Issue Date at prevailing market prices at the time of purchase by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer). The Investment Manager conducts trades in accordance with its cross-",p,p
transaction policy. See paragraph 5.1 “The Investment Manager and other matters relating to BlueMountain – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving BlueMountain and its Affiliate.”,p,uncertain
"On behalf of the Issuer, the Investment Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date pursuant to a financing arrangement (the “Warehouse Arrangements”). The Warehouse Arrangements were provided by a senior lender and a junior lender (the “Warehouse Providers”). Some of the Collateral Debt Obligations may have been acquired from the Warehouse Providers. The Warehouse Arrangements must be terminated in all respects on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements must be repaid on or prior to the Issue Date, including from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,p
The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer) is expected to purchase or enter into certain agreements to purchase 85 per cent. of the Target Par Amount of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Warehouse Providers in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date.,p,p
"The prices paid for such Collateral Debt Obligations will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Debt Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date.",p,p
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Debt Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,p
"The Warehouse Providers may purchase Notes on the Issue Date or at any time thereafter. None of the Warehouse Providers, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates have done, and no such person will do, any analysis of the Collateral Debt Obligations so acquired or sold for the benefit of, or in a manner designed to further the interests of, any Noteholder. The Warehouse Providers will not have the right to approve the sale or purchase of any Collateral Debt Obligations by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) on and after the Issue Date.",p,p
"By its purchase of Notes, each Noteholder is deemed to have consented on behalf of itself to the purchase of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer and the arrangements described above.",p,p
4.6 The Target Par Amount,p,title
The Issuer will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to pay any amounts due and payable in respect of the purchase price of Collateral Debt Obligations acquired on or prior to the Issue Date. The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only at the time that any commitment to purchase is entered into provided that Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations must satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date. It is possible that the obligations (other than Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations which settle on or prior to the Issue Date) may not satisfy such Eligibility Criteria on the later settlement of the acquisition thereof due to intervening events. Any failure by such obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.,p,p
"As of the Effective Date, the Issuer is required to have acquired, or entered into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that for the purposes of determining such Aggregate Principal Balance, any repayments or prepayments of Collateral Debt Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation",p,p
shall be the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Fitch Collateral Value). If the Target Par Amount has not been reached on the Effective Date an Effective Date Rating Event may occur pursuant to the Conditions which may in certain circumstances lead to an early redemption of the Notes.,p,p
4.7 Considerations relating to the Initial Investment Period,p,uncertain
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Debt Obligations in order to satisfy each of the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied as of the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date), Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests and the Target Par Amount requirement as at the Effective Date. See “The Portfolio.” The ability to satisfy such tests and the Target Par Amount requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Investment Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and the Target Par Amount requirement will be met. To the extent such additional Collateral Debt Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Debt Obligations could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Rated Notes. Such non confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes and therefore reduce the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Notes.",p,p
"Investors should note that, prior to the Determination Date relating to the first Payment Date, the Investment Manager may transfer some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to the Unused Proceeds Account for the purpose of being applied toward the purchase of additional Collateral Debt Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
4.8 Acquisition and disposition of Collateral Debt Obligations,p,uncertain
"The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it (or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf) will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals at least €297,500,000 (representing 85 per cent. of the Target Par Amount). The remaining proceeds deposited in the Unused Proceeds Account (following the payment of certain costs and expenses and deposits into the Expense Reserve Account and the First Period Reserve Account) shall be used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Debt Obligations during the Initial Investment Period (as defined in the Conditions). The Investment Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Debt Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Investment Manager to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes. There is no assurance that the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria, as applicable.",p,p
"Under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Investment Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Debt Obligations in any successive rolling 12 month period following the Effective Date, as well as any Collateral Debt Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Equity Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Impaired Obligation or Credit",p,p
"Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set out in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Investment Manager of Collateral Debt Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,p
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Investment Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Debt Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.",p,p
4.9 Underlying Portfolio,p,p
"Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds",p,uncertain
,p,td
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that at least 90.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Loans or Secured Senior Bonds (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (and Eligible Investments that represent Principal Proceeds in the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account), in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date);",p,p
"Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the borrower in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,p
"Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Secured Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,p
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,p
"Some Collateral Debt Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at 4.18 “Interest Rate Risk”.",p,p
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,p
"Senior Obligations, High Yield Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation, High Yield Bond or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan.",p,p
"However, although any particular Senior Obligation, Mezzanine Obligation or High Yield Bond may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation, Mezzanine Obligation or High Yield Bond will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,p
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations",p,p
,p,td
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,p
"Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.",p,p
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,p
,p,td
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other",p,uncertain
"indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,p
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,p
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,p
,p,td
"The Issuer or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Debt Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Subject to the Portfolio Profile Tests, not more than 30.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance must be comprised of Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,p
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,p
,p,td
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for High Yield Bonds.",p,p
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.",p,p
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,p
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior",p,p
"lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,p
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.24 “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations”. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both",p,p
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.,p,uncertain
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,p
"The Investment Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Transaction Documents, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,p
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,p
,p,td
"The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in- possession” financings.",p,p
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Debt Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Debt Obligation occurs.,p,p
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Debt Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligation.",p,p
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Obligations,p,p
,p,td
"The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Obligations. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations.",p,p
"Unsecured Senior Obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Obligation occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,p
4.10 Corporate Rescue Loans,p,title
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,p
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,p
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan may be unsecured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,p
4.11 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,title
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time as well as from Contributions by Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
"The Investment Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,p
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.",p,p

"The Investment Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,p
"4.13 Participations, Novations and Assignments",p,uncertain
"The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Debt Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.",p,p
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,p
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally",p,p
"will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.",p,p
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules. See 2.20 “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and",p,p
2.21 “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.,p,uncertain
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Aggregate Collateral Balance.,p,p
4.14 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,uncertain
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Debt Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,p
4.15 Counterparty Risk,p,title
"Assignments, Participations, and Hedge Transactions, involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,p
"If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will generally be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies.",p,p
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the",p,p

Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See 2.20 “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive”. Transactions with counterparties that are Covered Entities for the purposes of the QFC Stay Rules may also be subject to the limitations in such rules. See 2.21 “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.,p,p
4.16 Concentration Risk,p,title
"Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio – Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”. Although the resulting diversification of Collateral may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.",p,p
4.17 Credit Risk,p,title
Risks applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,p
4.18 Interest Rate Risk,p,title
"Each Class of Floating Rate Notes bears interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Debt Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain.",p,p
"As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, floating rate basis mismatch, maturity date and/or mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Floating Rate Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such interest rate hedge is a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes",p,p
"unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer’s exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See further “Hedging Arrangements”.",p,p
"If a significant number of Collateral Debt Obligations pay semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and reset risks, respectively. Furthermore, the Portfolio Profile Tests permit up to 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance to comprise Annual Obligations (being Collateral Debt Obligations which, in accordance with their terms, pay interest less frequently than semi-annually).",p,p
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,p
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,p
"To the extent that the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in obligors in respect of financial instruments held by the Issuer as Eligible Investments incurring negative deposit rates as a result of having issued such instruments and whilst such instruments remain outstanding, the Issuer (as holder of such instruments) may also be required to compensate the relevant obligors for such chargeable interest incurred in the form of a mandatory reduction in the principal amount outstanding of such instruments in accordance with their terms.",p,p
4.19 Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions – Currency Risk,p,uncertain
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 30.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Non-Euro Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limits set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. Although the Issuer intends to hedge against certain currency exposures pursuant to the Asset Swap Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Debt Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non-Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). The Investment Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Debt Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Asset Swap Transactions and due to restrictions in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Investment Manager may also be unable to find suitable Asset Swap Counterparties willing to provide Asset Swap Transactions. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Asset Swap Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Asset Swap Transaction would result in the Issuer being",p,p
"exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Asset Swap Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Asset Swap Counterparty. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See 2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, 2.7 “CFTC Regulations” and 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”.",p,p
"The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Asset Swap Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes. In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial up- front payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.",p,p
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Debt Obligations. This may cause losses.",p,uncertain
"The Issuer will depend upon the Asset Swap Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Asset Swap Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Asset Swap Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,p
"The Principal Balance of any Non-Euro Obligation shall be, to the extent the related Asset Swap Transaction terminates, the Spot Rate in respect of such Non-Euro Obligation multiplied by the outstanding principal amount of such Non-Euro Obligation.",p,p
4.20 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,uncertain
"To the extent the Investment Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,p
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Investment Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Debt Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Debt Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Investment Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds: see 3.8 “The Investment Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period”. The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Investment Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Portfolio. Any decrease in the yield of the Portfolio will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that if the Collateral Debt Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Debt Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Debt Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,p
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Debt Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Debt Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,p
4.21 Rising Interest Rates may Render some Obligors Unable to pay Interest on their Collateral Debt Obligations,p,p
"Most of the Collateral Debt Obligations bear interest at floating interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by the related Obligors will also increase. As prevailing interest rates increase, some Obligors may not be able to make the increased interest payments on Collateral Debt Obligations or refinance their balloon and bullet Collateral Debt Obligations, resulting in payment defaults, Defaulted Obligations and an inability of the Issuer to make payment on some or all Classes of Notes. Conversely if interest rates decline, Obligors may refinance their Collateral Debt Obligations at lower interest rates which could shorten the average life of the Notes.",p,p
4.22 Balloon Obligations and Bullet Obligations Present Refinancing Risk,p,uncertain
"The Collateral may consist of Collateral Debt Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Debt Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Debt Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Debt Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Debt Obligation on a timely basis or at all.",p,p
4.23 Ratings on Collateral Debt Obligations,p,p
Credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations represent the rating agencies’ opinions regarding their credit quality but are not a guarantee of such quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation,p,uncertain
"to buy, sell or hold Collateral Debt Obligations and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a credit rating assigned to any Collateral Debt Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Debt Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Debt Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Debt Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations included in or similar to the Collateral Debt Obligations will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward.",p,p
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Impaired Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation, a Fitch CCC Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation. The Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating. In some instances, the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Debt Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Debt Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Fitch and S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Investment Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Investment Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that may be made up of Collateral Debt Obligations where the S&P Rating is derived from the an S&P Rating. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Debt Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Debt Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Debt Obligation in question. Please see “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.",p,p
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised as at the date of this Offering Circular despite the fact that such Collateral Debt Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Credit Impaired Obligations, S&P CCC Obligations, Fitch CCC Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Debt Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,p
4.24 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations,p,uncertain
"Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-",p,p
"sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Debt Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, if the relevant Obligor becomes insolvent.",p,p
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Debt Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.,p,p
4.25 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,uncertain
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Investment Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,p
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Debt Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Investment Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,p
"Because Affiliates of, or Persons related to, BlueMountain may hold equity or other interests in Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer could be exposed to claims for equitable subordination or lender liability or both based on such equity or other holdings.",p,p
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Debt Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,p
4.26 Loan Repricing,p,title
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Debt Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Class.",p,p
4.27 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,p,uncertain
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments in respect of the Collateral Debt Obligations will not be subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than U.S. withholding tax on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) unless either: (i) such withholding can, upon the completion of the relevant procedural formalities, be eliminated or reclaimed by application being made under an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise; or (ii) the Obligor is required to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in market practice, any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations (including payments by Selling Institutions in the case of Participations) will not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor (or, in the case of Participations, the Selling Institution) is not obliged to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the Obligor, or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Debt Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross without withholding or deduction of tax. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax (if no corresponding gross up payment is received) would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If interest payments in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders or the Retention Holder).",p,p
4.28 Trading Gains,p,title
"Pursuant to the Conditions: (a) any Trading Gains realised in respect of any Collateral Debt Obligation to the extent that the deposit of such amounts into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Investment Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) a EU Retention Deficiency; and (b) any Trading Gains realised in respect of any Collateral Debt Obligation that the Investment Manager elects, up to a maximum cumulative amount of 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount, should be paid into the Interest Account (subject to certain conditions), will, in each case, be deposited into the Interest Account (rather than be deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes). Such Trading Gains may not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
4.29 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing,p,title
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Investment Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Investment Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Investment Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates acts as Hedge Counterparty or owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity. While the Initial Purchaser may own a portion of certain Classes of Rated Notes on the Issue Date and may own Notes at any time, it has no obligation to make any investment in any Notes and may sell at any time any Notes it does purchase.

Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer,",p,p
"Trustee, or the Investment Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. The Investment Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders. In particular, the Investment Manager will not have any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligations, except as may be required in connection with the regular reports prepared by the Issuer (or the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trust Deed.",p,p
"The Noteholders and the Trustee will not have any right to inspect any records relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations, and the Investment Manager will not be obligated to disclose any further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Debt Obligations, unless (i) specifically required by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or (ii) following its receipt of a written request from the Trustee, the Investment Manager in its sole discretion determines that the disclosure of such further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Debt Obligation to the Trustee would not be prohibited by applicable law or the Underlying Instruments relating to such Collateral Debt Obligation, in which case the Investment Manager will disclose such further information or evidence to the Trustee; provided that (a) the Trustee will not disclose such further information or evidence to any third party except (i) to the extent disclosure may be required by law or any governmental or regulatory authority; and (ii) to the extent that the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations under the Trust Deed.

5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,p,title
"The Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Investment Manager and its Affiliates, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The activities of the Rating Agencies in connection with the transaction described herein may also give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,p
5.1 The Investment Manager and other matters relating to BlueMountain,p,uncertain
"The following briefly summarises certain potential and actual conflicts of interest which may arise from the overall investment activity of the Investment Manager, its clients and its Affiliates, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,p
Performance history of the Investment Manager may not be indicative of future results,p,p
,p,td
"The past performance of the Investment Manager’s principals and Affiliates thereof in managing other portfolios or investment vehicles may not be indicative of the results that the Investment Manager may be able to achieve with the Collateral Debt Obligations. Similarly, the past performance of the Investment Manager’s principals or Affiliates thereof over a particular period may not be indicative of the results that may occur in future periods. Furthermore, the nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer’s investments may differ from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the principals and Affiliates of the Investment Manager. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as past investments of the Investment Manager’s principals or Affiliates thereof, that the Issuer will be able to avoid losses or that the Issuer will be able to make investments similar to such past investment. In addition, such past investments may have been made utilising a leveraged capital structure, and an asset mix and fee arrangements that are different from the anticipated capital structure, asset mix and fee arrangements of the Issuer. Moreover, because the eligibility criteria that govern investments in the Collateral Debt Obligations do not govern the Investment Manager’s investments and investment strategies generally, such investments conducted in accordance with such criteria, and the results they yield, are not directly comparable with, and may differ substantially from other investments undertaken by the Investment Manager’s principals and Affiliates.",p,p
"The Issuer will depend on the managerial expertise available to BlueMountain, its Affiliates and its key personnel",p,p
,p,td
"Because the composition of the Portfolio will vary over time, the performance of the Portfolio depends heavily on the skills of the Investment Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Debt Obligations. As a result, the Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of the investment professionals employed by BlueMountain who are assigned to select and manage the Portfolio and perform the other obligations of the Investment Manager under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The Investment Manager has informed the Issuer that the investment professionals associated with the Investment Manager are actively involved in other investment activities not concerning the Issuer and will not be able to devote all of their time to the Issuer’s business and affairs. Additionally, there is no assurance that investment professionals currently employed by BlueMountain who are assigned to select and manage the Portfolio and perform the other obligations of the Investment Manager will continue to be employed by BlueMountain or will continue to be assigned to select and manage the Portfolio or to perform the Investment Manager’s other obligations and any such changes may be made without notice to, or the consent of, the Issuer. Employment arrangements between such persons and the Investment Manager may exist, but the Issuer is not a direct beneficiary of such arrangements, which arrangements are in any event subject to change without notice to, or the consent of, the Issuer. The Investment Manager may add additional employees to select and manage the Portfolio and perform the other obligations of the Investment Manager at any time without notice to, or the consent of, the Issuer. Any such additional employees may not have the same level of experience in selecting and managing loans and high-yield debt securities and performing such other obligations as the persons they replace. Any such change to the persons appointed by the Investment Manager to perform such obligations may have an adverse effect on the Portfolio, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed. See “BlueMountain and the Investment Manager and the provision of investment management services” and “Description of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement”.",p,p
"The Investment Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances described herein. See “Description of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement—Removal, Resignation and Replacement of the Investment Manager.” No resignation or removal of the Investment Manager will be effective until a substitute for the Investment Manager has been appointed. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to the Investment Manager upon the resignation or removal of the Investment Manager in such capacity will have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Investment Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed. See “Description of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement – Removal, Resignation and Replacement of the Investment Manager”.",p,p
"The Investment Manager will not be liable in contract or tort to the Issuer, the Trustee or the Noteholders or to any other person for any loss incurred as a result of the actions taken by the Investment Manager under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, except, in the case of the Issuer, by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of its obligations under the express terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or by reason of any information provided by the Investment Manager for inclusion in this Offering Circular containing any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. See “Description of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement – Responsibilities of the Investment Manager, Indemnities”. Investors should note that for such purpose and notwithstanding that the Notes and the Transaction Documents are governed by English law, the interpretation of “gross negligence” will be pursuant to New York law. Under New York law, the concept of gross negligence is a significantly lower standard of care than negligence under English law, requiring conduct akin to intentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference under English law. As a result, the Investment Manager may in some circumstances have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Transaction Documents where it would otherwise have been liable if a mere negligence standard was applied under English law or if New York law was not designated as the law pursuant to which the concept of gross negligence for this purpose would be interpreted.",p,p
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving BlueMountain and its Affiliates,p,uncertain
"On the Issue Date, the Retention Holder intends to purchase and retain the Retention Notes and it is anticipated that one or more other Investment Manager Related Persons (as defined below) will purchase the remaining Subordinated Notes. BlueMountain and/or its Affiliates may from time to time hold other Notes of any Class. The Retention Holder will on the Issue Date hold and retain the Retention Notes provided that (i) if the Investment Manager is removed and none of its Affiliates are appointed as successor, then it (or any of its Affiliates to which the Retention Notes have been transferred in accordance with paragraph (ii) below), may dispose of the Retention Notes provided that such transfer is permitted in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and provided that such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements; and (ii) the Retention Holder may at any time transfer the Retention Notes to an Affiliate which is part of the same consolidated accounting group provided that such transfer is permitted in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and provided that such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements provided further that if at any time following (and as a consequence of) such transfer it is necessary to ensure compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the Retention Holder shall procure that the Retention Notes are re-transferred to itself or any other entity permitted under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements at such time. BlueMountain and its employees, clients and Affiliates may buy additional Notes at any time, from which BlueMountain or such employees, clients or Affiliates may derive revenues and profits in addition to the fees disclosed herein. There will be no restriction on the ability of BlueMountain or its Affiliates, any director, officer or employee of such entities or any fund or account for which BlueMountain or its Affiliates exercise discretionary voting authority on behalf of such fund or account in respect of the Notes (an “Investment Manager Related Person”), the Collateral Administrator, or any of their respective Affiliates or employees to purchase the Notes (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) and to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled (except that Notes held by BlueMountain and any other Investment Manager Related Person shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights in connection with the removal of the Investment Manager and as otherwise described in the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement).",p,p
"If an Optional Redemption, redemption following a Note Tax Event or an acceleration of the Notes after an Event of Default occurs, the Investment Manager has the right to bid on all or a portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations for its own account, the account of any Affiliate or an account that it manages, subject to the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in the Trust Deed. Further, pursuant to Condition 11(d) (Purchase of Collateral by Noteholders or the Investment Manager), upon any sale of any part of the Collateral following the security over the Collateral becoming enforceable following acceleration of the Notes under Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Investment Manager or any Investment Manager Related Person may (but shall not be obliged to) bid for and purchase the Collateral or any part thereof on an arm’s length basis and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain, possess or dispose of such property in its or their own absolute right without accountability.",p,p
"The Investment Manager is entitled to the Senior Investment Management Fee, the Subordinated Investment Management Fee and, in certain circumstances, the Incentive Investment Management Fee in the priorities set forth herein, subject to the Priorities of Payment as described herein and the availability of funds therefor. Pursuant to the Priorities of Payment and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager may elect to (x) permanently waive (including pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement),",p,p
"(y) designate for reinvestment or (z) defer payment of all or a part of the Senior Investment Management Fee and (x) permanently waive (including pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement) or (y) defer payment of all or a part of the Subordinated Investment Management Fee due to be paid to it on a Payment Date. The deferral or permanent waiver by the Investment Manager of Senior Investment Management Fees or Subordinated Investment Management Fees could provide incentive for the Investment Manager to make more speculative investments in the Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer than would otherwise be the case, and by reason of the Incentive Investment Management Fee, the Investment Manager may have a conflict between its obligation to manage the Portfolio prudently and the financial incentive created by such fees for the Investment Manager to make investments that are riskier or more aggressive than would be the case in the absence of such fees.",p,p

"Issuer under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, they will not devote all of their working time to the affairs of the Issuer. As part of their regular business, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions both for their respective accounts and for the accounts of their respective clients, on a principal or agency basis, with respect to loans, securities and other investments and financial instruments of all types. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees also provide investment advisory services, among other services. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees will not be restricted in their performance of any such services or in the types of debt or equity investments which they may make. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may have economic interests in or other relationships with issuers in whose obligations or securities or credit exposures the Issuer may invest. In particular, such persons may make and/or hold an investment in an issuer’s securities that may be pari passu, senior or junior in ranking to an investment in such issuer’s securities made and/or held by the Issuer or in which partners, security holders, officers, directors, agents or employees of such persons serve on boards of directors or otherwise have ongoing relationships. Each of such ownership and other relationships may result in securities laws restrictions on transactions in such securities by the Issuer and otherwise create conflicts of interest for the Issuer. In such instances, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may in their discretion make investment recommendations and effect investment decisions that may be the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer’s investments. In connection with any such activities described above, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions in securities or investments of a type that may be suitable to be included as Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees will not be required to offer such securities or investments to the Issuer or provide notice of such activities to the Issuer.",p,p
"The Investment Manager, its clients, its partners, its members or their employees and their Affiliates (“Related Entities”) have invested and may continue to invest in debt obligations that would also be appropriate as Collateral Debt Obligations and may purchase or sell securities and loans for or on behalf of themselves and their managed accounts without purchasing or selling such securities or loans for the Issuer and may purchase or sell securities or loans for the Issuer without purchasing or selling such securities or loans for themselves or their managed accounts, subject to any restrictions applicable in the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the Investment Manager nor any Related Entity has any duty, in making or maintaining such investments, to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any such opportunity to the Issuer. The investment policies, fee arrangements and other circumstances applicable to such other parties may vary from those applicable to the Issuer. The Investment Manager and its Related Entities may also have or establish relationships with companies whose debt obligations are Collateral Debt Obligations and may now or in the future own or seek to acquire equity securities or debt obligations issued by issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations, and such debt obligations may have interests different from or adverse to the debt obligations that are Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may in the future organise and manage one or more entities with objectives similar to or different from those of the Issuer. In addition, the Investment Manager and any of its Related Entities may serve as a general partner and/or manager of limited partnerships or other entities organised to issue notes or certificates, similar to the Notes, which are secured by high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments, or may manage third party accounts which invest in high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments. The Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may also provide other advisory services for a fee to issuers whose debt obligations or other securities are Collateral Debt Obligations, and neither the Noteholders nor the Issuer shall have any right to such fees. In connection with the foregoing activities the Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may from time to time come into possession of material non-public information that limits the ability of the Investment Manager to effect a transaction for the Issuer, and the Issuer’s investments may be constrained as a consequence of the Investment Manager’s inability to use such information for advisory purposes or otherwise to effect transactions that otherwise may have been initiated on behalf of its clients, including the Issuer. See “BlueMountain and the Investment Manager and the provision of investment management services”.",p,p
"Furthermore, the Investment Manager’s ability to buy obligations (on behalf of the Issuer) for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell obligations which are part of the Portfolio may be restricted by limitations contained in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Investment Manager (on",p,p
"behalf of the Issuer) may be unable to buy or sell obligations or to take other actions that the Investment Manager might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders. The Investment Manager and any of its Affiliates may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others, which may include, without limitation, serving as investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being Affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by securities such as the Notes and other trusts and pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with securities issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Investment Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer, and the Investment Manager may furnish investment management and advisory services to others who may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Investment Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own securities which are the same type as the Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p
"The Investment Manager may, to the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, effect client cross-transactions where the Investment Manager causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and other fund(s) or account(s) advised by it or any of its Affiliates. In addition, with the prior authorisation of the Issuer, which can be revoked at any time, the Investment Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, in which case any such Affiliate will receive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both parties to the transaction. In addition, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, effect transactions between the Issuer and the Investment Manager and/or any of its Affiliates as principal and/or any fund or account for which the Investment Manager or any Affiliate of the Investment Manager serves as investment adviser or investment manager.",p,p
"The Investment Manager may make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of its Related Entities which differ from those effected with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager may often be seeking simultaneously to purchase or sell investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as investment manager or for Related Entities, and the Investment Manager will have the discretion to apportion such purchases or sales among such entities. Prior to the Issue Date, the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may effect acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations or enter into binding commitments to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer, from funds or other CLOs in relation to which the Investment Manager or any of its Affiliates, may be the investment manager or may exercise investment discretion in relation thereto. The Investment Manager cannot assure equal treatment across its investment clients. When the Investment Manager determines that it would be appropriate for the Issuer and one or more Related Entities to participate in an investment opportunity or sell an investment, the Investment Manager will seek to execute orders for all of the participating investment accounts, including the Issuer and its own account, on an equitable basis. If the Investment Manager has determined to invest or sell at the same time for more than one of the Related Entities, the Investment Manager will generally place combined orders for all such Related Entities simultaneously and if all such orders are not filled at the same price, it will use reasonable efforts to allocate such purchases and sales in an equitable manner and in accordance with applicable law. Similarly, if an order on behalf of more than one Related Entity cannot be fully executed under prevailing market conditions, the Investment Manager will allocate the investments traded among the Issuer and different Related Entities on a basis that it considers equitable. Situations may occur where the Issuer could be disadvantaged because of the investment activities conducted by the Investment Manager for the Related Entities.",p,p
"The Investment Manager may participate in creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or work out of issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations. In such circumstances, the Investment Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager will be entitled to receive any steering committee fees associated with a bankruptcy, restructuring or work out (except any fees received in connection with the extension of the maturity of a Defaulted Obligation or a reduction in the outstanding principal balance of a Defaulted Obligation) received in connection with the work out or restructuring of any Defaulted Obligations or Collateral Debt Obligations.",p,p

Any investment in Notes by the Investment Manager or one or more Investment Manager Related Persons may give the Investment Manager an incentive to take actions that may vary from the interests of the holders of other Notes.",p,p
"The Trust Deed places significant restrictions on the Investment Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Debt Obligations, and the Investment Manager is required to comply with these restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Investment Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Debt Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interests of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Trust Deed.",p,p
"The Investment Manager has discussed the composition of the Issuer’s Collateral Debt Obligations or other matters relating to the transaction with its Affiliates or clients purchasing Notes or with third party investors (including the junior lender in connection with the Warehouse Arrangements). There can be no assurance that any such discussions will not influence the Investment Manager’s decisions or that any other investor involved in such discussions did not have interests adverse to the Noteholders, including by virtue of it having taken a short position (for example, by buying protection under a credit default swap) relating to obligations or securities included in the Portfolio.",p,p

If any such acquisitions or commitments were to take place, the relevant transactions would be executed at a mid- market price obtained from, to the extent possible, an external pricing service selected by the Investment Manager in accordance with its internal pricing procedures. Where such external pricing service is not readily available or is not considered reliable, alternative quotations will be sought (although, ultimately if there are no available or reliable external quotations, a determination will be made by the Investment Manager of a reasonable fair value, which must be approved by its pricing committee), all in accordance with the Investment Manager’s internal pricing policy procedures.",p,p

"If BlueMountain satisfies certain requirements of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series are enforceable against the assets of such Series only, and not against the assets of BlueMountain generally or against the assets of any of the other Series, and, unless otherwise provided in the limited liability company agreement of BlueMountain, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to BlueMountain generally or any other Series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series.",p,p
"To establish a Delaware limited liability company with separate series of limited liability company interests and maintain the separateness of its series, BlueMountain must adhere to specific statutory requirements regarding its certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement and books and records. As a Delaware limited liability company with separate series of limited liability company interests, the failure of BlueMountain to strictly adhere to these statutory requirements may result in the loss of the benefits of the Delaware law regarding segregation of assets and liabilities.",p,p
"In addition BlueMountain is a single legal entity which may be subject to claims in jurisdictions that may not recognise the segregation of assets and liabilities amongst series. The series limited liability company legislation has not been subject to litigation in Delaware or elsewhere resulting in published judicial opinions. There is currently no indication as to how the segregation of assets and liabilities will be treated by courts outside of Delaware. There is a risk that a court, including a Bankruptcy Court, could chose to either disregard Delaware law or to consolidate one or more Series and determine that the assets of any one Series should be applied to meet the liabilities of any other Series or BlueMountain generally, particularly if the assets of such other Series or BlueMountain generally are insufficient to meet their respective liabilities. Such consolidation could have a material adverse impact on the performance of a Series of BlueMountain.",p,p

The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market.,p,p
"The Credit Suisse Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments (including but not limited to instruments such as the Notes) for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business.",p,p
"The Credit Suisse Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed, underwritten or syndicated certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Debt Obligations. In addition, the Credit Suisse Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Debt Obligations. Each of the Credit Suisse Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors affiliated with the Credit Suisse Parties or in which one or more Credit Suisse Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Credit Suisse Parties’ own investments in such Obligors while the value of the Notes may decline.",p,p
"From time to time the Investment Manager (pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement) may purchase from or sell Collateral Debt Obligations through or to the Credit Suisse Parties and one or more Credit Suisse Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to interests in Participations and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The entry into of Participations and/or Hedge Transactions by any Credit Suisse Party is expected to increase the profitability of such Credit Suisse Party and it is not intended that the interests of the Noteholders or any other party will be taken into account by the relevant Credit Suisse Party in the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations under Participations or Hedge Transactions. The Credit Suisse Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser and/or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.",p,p
"The Credit Suisse Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse Parties and employees or customers of the Credit Suisse Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to, or referencing, the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. On the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties will purchase certain Classes of Notes; however, they may sell those Notes at any time. After the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties may purchase Notes from time to time. If a Credit Suisse Party becomes an owner of or obtains exposure to any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Credit Suisse Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Credit Suisse Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,p
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer, and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Collateral or the actions of the Investment Manager or the Issuer and will have no authority to advise the Investment Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Investment Manager and the Issuer (respectively). If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates own Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owners of Notes in actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,p

See “Forced Transfer”.",p,p
7. RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER UNDER IRISH LAW,p,p
7.1 Prior activities of the Issuer,p,uncertain
The only operations that an issuer of structured rated notes similar to the Notes is ordinarily permitted to perform prior to the issue date thereof is the entry into the warehouse arrangements in respect of the acquisition of certain assets on which such notes are to be secured on or prior to such issue date. This is to mitigate the risk that creditors of the issuer may exist as a result of the activities of such issuer who may be able to take action against the issuer should it not perform its obligations to the extent that such creditors have not entered into limited recourse and non-petition provisions similar to those to which the Secured Parties are subject pursuant to the Trust Deed.,p,p
7.2 Preferred Creditors under Irish Law and Floating Charges,p,uncertain
"If the Issuer becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Issuer has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, the Noteholders (and other Secured Parties) may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company, such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) which have been approved by the relevant Irish courts. See 7.3 “Examinership”.",p,p
"The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.",p,p
"Where the holder of the security has given notice to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.",p,p
The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.,p,p
"In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company which are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.",p,uncertain
"The essence of a fixed charge is that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer any charge constituted by the Trust Deed and/or the Irish Security Agreement may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.",p,p
"In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the monies standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.",p,p
"Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security over the relevant charged assets would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.",p,p
"Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:",p,p
"(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;",p,p
"(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up even if crystallised prior to the commencement of the winding- up;",p,p
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;,p,uncertain
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and,p,p
(e) they rank after fixed charges.,p,p
7.3 Examinership,p,uncertain
"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) (the “Companies Act”) to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court.",p,p
"The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after",p,p
"this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.",p,p
"During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.",p,p
"In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders.",p,p
"If an examiner were appointed in respect of the Issuer, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:",p,uncertain
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed and/or the Irish Security Agreement;,p,p
"(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;",p,uncertain
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and,p,p
"(d) if a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.",p,p
7.4 Irish Taxation Position of the Issuer,p,uncertain
"Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Irish withholding tax if there is a change in Irish tax law or if the various exemption conditions set forth under “Tax Considerations – Irish Taxation – Income Tax” and “Tax Considerations – Irish Taxation – Withholding Taxes” are not fulfilled. The Issuer is not obligated to gross up or otherwise compensate Noteholders for withholding taxes incurred. This may, therefore, affect the return which Noteholders received on the Notes.",p,p
Changes in Irish tax laws may adversely impact the Issuer’s business and the value of the Noteholders’ investment.,p,uncertain
The Issuer is treated as a securitisation vehicle which is taxed pursuant to Section 110 of the TCA. There is no guarantee that the tax treatment of an Irish securitisation company will not change in the future. The tax deductibility of the Issuer’s interest costs will depend on the applicability of Section 110 of the TCA and the current revenue practice in relation to that matter. If these rules change this may have an impact on the return for Noteholders.,p,p
7.5 Irish securitisation legislation,p,uncertain
"The Issuer has been advised that it should fall within the Irish regime for the taxation of ‘qualifying companies’ as set out in Section 110 of the TCA. As a result, it is anticipated that the Issuer should be subject to Irish corporation tax only on its profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice, after deducting all of its revenue expenses (including interest payable to the Noteholders in respect of the",p,p
"Notes). If, for any reason, the Issuer is not or ceases to be such a ‘qualifying company’ for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA, and is not entitled to deduct all its revenue expenses for Irish tax purposes, the Issuer could be obliged to account for Irish tax in respect of profits for Irish tax purposes, which are in excess of profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice. This could result in material tax being payable in Ireland which has not been contemplated in the cash flows in respect of the Notes issued to the Noteholders. In such circumstances, the Irish tax treatment of both the Issuer and payments by the Issuer in respect of the Notes could be adversely affected. In turn, this may therefore affect the return which the Noteholders receive on the Notes.",p,p
"The Irish Government published draft legislation on 17 October 2019 as part of the Finance Bill 2019 that proposes to introduce some measures which may qualify the extent to which interest payable in respect of results-dependent securities (such as the Subordinated Notes) may be deducted for Irish tax purposes. The measures propose that, in certain circumstances, interest paid to persons which both hold 20% or more of results-dependent securities and exercise ‘significant influence’ over the Issuer may only be deducted for Irish tax purposes to the extent it is paid to a person that is resident in Ireland or otherwise within the charge to Irish corporation tax or the interest is subject to tax in a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a jurisdiction with which Ireland has a double tax treaty. It is proposed that ‘significant influence’ will mean an ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the Issuer. The proposed changes to the legislation have not yet been enacted though are anticipated to be in force from 1 January 2020. In addition, it is not clear who could be considered to exercise ‘significant influence’ over the Issuer.",p,p

The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.,p,p
"The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P and Fitch address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes by S&P and Fitch address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.",p,p
"In respect of any Notes that are subject to a Refinancing in accordance with Condition 7(b)(v)(C) (Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Whole), the ratings assigned to the Notes will not necessarily continue to be assigned to the Refinancing Obligations issued pursuant thereto.",p,p
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency.",p,p
"As of the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union (“EU”) and is registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (as amended) (“CRA3”). As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance with CRA3.",p,p

"The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.",p,uncertain
S&P will rate the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:,p,p
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes;,p,p
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and,p,uncertain
(c) legal considerations.,p,uncertain
"Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the period beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the expiry of the Reinvestment Period and thereafter, in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria as set out in the section of this Offering Circular headed “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”.",p,p
"S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”) which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Investment Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Debt Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,p
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,p
"There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, or the Retention Holder, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.",p,p
"S&P’s Ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.",p,p
Fitch Ratings,h2,title
The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Fitch are based upon Fitch’s statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with similar characteristics to the Collateral Debt Obligations and the various eligibility requirements that the Collateral Debt Obligations are required to satisfy.,p,p
"Fitch analyses the likelihood that each Collateral Debt Obligation will default, based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Fitch then determines the level of credit protection necessary based on a specific percentile of the portfolio default distribution determined by the Fitch “Portfolio Credit Model” which takes into account the correlation between assets in the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. The results of a statistical analysis are incorporated into a cash flow model built to mimic the structure of the transaction. In this regard, the results of several default scenarios, in conjunction with various qualitative tests (e.g. analysis of the strength of the Investment Manager), are used to determine the credit enhancement required to support a particular rating.",p,p
Fitch’s ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.,p,uncertain
"There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by Fitch in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not defer from those assumed by Fitch.",p,p

The Issuer will have the benefit of limited recourse and non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).",p,p
Termination Provisions,p,p
,p,td
"Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of certain events (which may include without limitation):",p,p
"certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;",p,p

regulatory changes occur which have a material adverse effect on a Hedge Counterparty; and,p,uncertain
material changes are made to the Transaction Documents without the consent of a Hedge Counterparty which could have a material adverse effect on the Hedge Counterparty.,p,uncertain
"A termination of a Hedge Agreement does not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes, though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an “additional termination event” under a Hedge Agreement.",p,uncertain
Asset Swap Agreements may also contain provisions which allow an Asset Swap Transaction to terminate upon the occurrence of certain credit events related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These credit events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Debt Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation. In such instances the related Asset Swap Transaction would terminate and the Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf) may need to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation unless a new Asset Swap Transaction can be entered into.,p,p
Rating Downgrade Requirements,p,p

"Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies for the type of derivative transaction represented by the Hedge Transactions if the Hedge Counterparty or, as relevant, its guarantor, is subject to a voting withdrawal or downgrade by a Rating Agency to below the applicable Rating Requirement. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.",p,p
Transfer and Modification,p,p
,p,td
"The Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge Agreement following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the Irish regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.",p,p
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.,p,p

TAX CONSIDERATIONS,h2,uncertain
1. GENERAL,p,uncertain
Purchasers of the Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.,p,uncertain
"Potential purchasers who are in any doubt about their tax position on purchase, ownership, transfer or exercise of any Note should consult their own tax advisers. In particular, no representation is made as to the manner in which payments under the Notes would be characterised by any relevant tax authority. Potential investors should be aware that the relevant fiscal rules or their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, and that this summary is not exhaustive. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice or a guarantee to any potential investor of the tax consequences of investing in the Notes.",p,p
2. IRISH TAXATION,p,title
"The following is a summary of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain other classes of persons such as dealers in securities.",p,p
"The summary is based upon Irish tax laws and the practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular, which are subject to prospective or retroactive change. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own advisors as to the Irish or other tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Notes including, in particular, the effect of any state or local tax laws.",p,p
2.1 Income Tax,p,title
"In general, persons who are resident in Ireland are liable to Irish taxation on their world-wide income whereas persons who are not resident in Ireland are only liable to Irish taxation on their Irish source income. All persons are under a statutory obligation to account for Irish taxation on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.",p,p
"The Notes issued by the Issuer may be regarded as property situate in Ireland (and hence Irish source income) on the grounds that a debt is deemed to be situate where the debtor resides. However, the interest earned on such Notes is exempt from income tax if paid to a person who is not a resident of Ireland and who for the purposes of Section 198 of the TCA is regarded as being a resident of a relevant territory. A relevant territory for this purpose is a Member State of the European Communities (other than Ireland) or not being such a Member State a territory with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty that has the force of law or, on completion of the necessary procedures, will have the force of law and such double tax treaty contains an article dealing with interest or income from debt claims. A list of the countries with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty is available on www.revenue.ie.",p,p
Relief from Irish income tax may also be available under other exemptions contained in Irish tax legislation or under the specific provisions of a double tax treaty between Ireland and the country of residence of the holder of the Notes.,p,uncertain
If the above exemptions do not apply it is understood that there is a long standing unpublished practice whereby no action will be taken to pursue any liability to such Irish tax in respect of persons who are regarded as not being resident in Ireland except where such persons:,p,p
(a) are chargeable in the name of a person (including a trustee) or in the name of an agent or branch in Ireland having the management or control of the interest; or,p,uncertain
(b) seek to claim relief and / or repayment of tax deducted at source in respect of taxed income from Irish sources; or,p,p
(c) are chargeable to Irish corporation tax on the income of an Irish branch or agency or to income tax on the profits of a trade carried on in Ireland to which the interest is attributable.,p,p
There can be no assurance that this practice will continue to apply.,p,uncertain
2.2 Withholding Taxes,p,uncertain
"In general, withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) must be deducted from interest payments made by an Irish company such as the Issuer. However, Section 246 of the TCA (“Section 246”) provides that this general obligation to withhold tax does not apply in respect of, inter alia, interest payments made by the Issuer to a person, who by virtue of the law of the relevant territory, is resident for the purposes of tax in a relevant territory (see above for details). This exemption does not apply if the interest is paid to a company in connection with a trade or business which is carried on in Ireland by the company through a branch or agency.",p,p
"Apart from Section 246, Section 64 of the TCA (“Section 64”) provides for the payment of interest on a “Quoted Eurobond” without deduction of tax in certain circumstances. A Quoted Eurobond is defined in Section 64 as a security which:",p,p

"Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. The Issuer will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be subject to the PFIC rules, except for certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC (as described below under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”). U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should consider making an election to treat the Issuer as a QEF. Generally, a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election on IRS Form 8621, attaching a copy of that form to its U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it held its Subordinated Notes. If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. A U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.",p,p
"In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute all of its earnings in a taxable year, the electing U.S. Holder may also be permitted to elect to defer payment of some or all of the taxes on the QEF’s income, subject to an interest charge (which is nondeductible to individuals) on the deferred amount. In this regard, prospective purchasers of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is expected that the Collateral Debt Obligations will include high-yield debt obligations and such instruments may have substantial OID, the cash payment of which may be deferred, perhaps for a substantial period of time. In addition, the Issuer may use proceeds from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations to retire other classes of Notes. As a result, in any given year, the Issuer may have substantial amounts of earnings for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are not distributed on the Subordinated Notes. Thus, absent an election to defer payment of taxes, U.S. Holders that make a QEF election with respect to the Issuer may owe tax on significant “phantom” income.",p,p
"The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,p
"A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (other than certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC, described below) that does not make a timely QEF election will be required to report the U.S. dollar value of any gain on the disposition of its Subordinated Notes as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, and to compute the tax liability on such gain and any “Excess Distribution” (as defined below) received in respect of the Subordinated Notes as if such items had been earned ratably over each day in the U.S. Holder’s holding period (or a certain portion thereof) for the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. Holder will be subject to tax on such gain or Excess Distributions at the highest ordinary income tax rate for each taxable year in which such gain or Excess Distributions are treated as having been earned, other than the current year (for which the U.S. Holder’s regular ordinary income tax rate will apply), regardless of the rate otherwise applicable to the U.S. Holder. Further, such",p,p
"U.S. Holder will also be liable for an interest charge (which is nondeductible to individuals) as if such income tax liabilities had been due with respect to each such year. For purposes of these rules, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganisations and use of the Subordinated Notes as security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions of such Subordinated Notes. In addition, a stepped-up basis in the Subordinated Notes will not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. Holder who has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer.",p,p
"An “Excess Distribution” is the amount by which the U.S. dollar value of distributions during a taxable year in respect of a Note exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions in respect thereof during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Note).",p,p
"In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made. A U.S. HOLDER OF SUBORDINATED NOTES SHOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER MAKING A QEF ELECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER.",p,p
"Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Issuer will be a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the equity interests in the Issuer, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by 10 per cent. United States shareholders. For this purpose, a “10 per cent. United States shareholder” is any “United States person” (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code) that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of equity in the Issuer. Thus, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (and/or any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) possessing directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) would be treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), determined with respect to the combined voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such 10 per cent. United States shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. If, for any given taxable year, the Issuer is treated as a CFC, a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer will be required to include as ordinary income an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of that person’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s “subpart F income” at the end of such taxable year. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income.",p,p
"If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Holder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the “qualified portion” of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Holder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Holder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified portion and has not made a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In that case, the Issuer will again be treated as a PFIC which is not a QEF with respect to the U.S. Holder and the beginning of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will continue to be the date upon which the U.S. Holder acquired the Subordinated Notes, unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to recognise gain with respect to the",p,p

"Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs. If the Issuer owns a Collateral Debt Obligation that is treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences.",p,p

"Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Debt Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.",p,p
"If a Collateral Debt Obligation is treated as an indirect equity interest in a CFC and a U.S. Holder owns directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the CFC’s voting power or value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Holder generally will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” as ordinary income at the end of each taxable year, as described above under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”, regardless of whether the CFC distributed any amounts to the Issuer during such taxable year or whether the U.S. Holder made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held CFC. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of the CFC, and the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (as described below), generally will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, reduced by any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax issues associated with such investments in light of their own individual circumstances.",p,p
"Phantom Income. U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the amounts that exceed the distributions they receive on the Subordinated Notes. For example, if the Issuer is a CFC and a U.S. Holder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, or a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the U.S. Holder will be subject to federal income tax with respect to its share of the Issuer’s income and gain (to the extent of the Issuer’s “earnings and profits”), which may exceed the Issuer’s distributions. It is expected that the Issuer’s income and gain (and earnings and profits) will exceed cash distributions with respect to (i) debt instruments that were issued with OID and are held by the Issuer, (ii) the acquisition at a discount of the Rated Notes by the Issuer (including by reason of a Refinancing, change to an Alternative Base Rate or any deemed exchange that occurs for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a modification of the Trust Deed) and (iii) the use of interest proceeds to make payments on the Class X Principal Amortisation Amount.

CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,h2,title
"ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” subject thereto including entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification and investments being made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.",p,p
"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.",p,p
"Governmental plans, certain church plans and certain non-U.S. plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under Federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.",p,uncertain
"Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, the “Plan Asset Regulation”) if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets (such as the Investment Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plans’ investment in such entity.",p,p
"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,p
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for the purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes and the Class F Notes may and Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the",p,p
"Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for the purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will be required to or deemed to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class and in accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA, the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for the purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.",p,p
"Even if the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes would not be treated as equity interests in the Issuer for the purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.",p,p
"Each of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, or their respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception (if any) applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,p
"It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.

Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention Requirements, the EU Transparency Requirements and investor due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain.

,p,
,p,
U.S. RISK RETENTION REQUIREMENTS,h3,
,p,
"The U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) generally require the “sponsor”, either directly or through a “majority owned affiliate”, to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of a securitisation transaction. In the LSTA Decision (as defined below), the Panel (as defined below) held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that the Collateral Manager has determined that the Collateral Manager will not be required to retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement (as defined below) pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; notwithstanding such determination in respect of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes (as defined below) on the Issue Date, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – U.S. Dodd-Frank Act” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives –",p,
U.S. Risk Retention Rules”.,p,
VOLCKER RULE,h3,
,p,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that have a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in certain financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in sponsoring, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.",p,
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the covered fund. A “covered fund” is also defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”) will also fall within the definition of a “covered fund”.",p,
"The holders of any of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a covered fund, then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in ownership interests of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by banking entities in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. See “Risk Factors,p,
– Regulatory Initiatives – Volcker Rule” below.,p,

"Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.",p,
PRIIPs Regulation,h3,

"The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) is not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared by the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to certain retail investors in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.",p,

Retention Holder and U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,
,td,
"The U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require that (subject to certain exceptions) the “sponsor” of a securitisation transaction, either directly or through its “majority-owned affiliates” acquires and retains an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitised assets of at least 5 per cent. in accordance with the methodologies permitted by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. In the LSTA Decision, the Panel held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that the Collateral Manager has determined that the Collateral Manager will not be required to retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; notwithstanding such determination in respect of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes (as defined below) on the Issue Date with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements.

RISK FACTORS,h3,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions”.",p,
1. GENERAL,h3,
1.1 General,p,
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in loans, bonds and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payments. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payments). In particular, payments in respect of the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes. None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Agents or the Collateral Manager undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer (or, in relation to the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and the Trustee or the Collateral Manager) during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the other Agents which is not included in this Offering Circular.",p,
1.2 Suitability,h3,
"Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,h3,
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payments. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.",p,
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,h3,
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The",p,
regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.,p,
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,h3,
"Following the onset of the global credit crisis in 2008, many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.",p,
"As discussed further in “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.",p,
"The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions,",p,
"markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.",p,
"While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.",p,
"1.6 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders",h3,
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,h3,
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission (the “Commission”) created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the risk that Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily, including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,
"The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These",p,
"potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.",p,
1.8 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,h3,
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.",p,
1.9 Referendum on the UK’s EU Membership,h3,
"On 23 June 2016, the UK held an advisory referendum with respect to its continued membership of the EU (the “Referendum”). The result of the Referendum was a vote in favour of leaving the EU. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Article 50”) provides that a Member State which decides to withdraw from the EU is required to notify the European Council of its intention to do so.",p,
"The UK government gave formal notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 on 29 March 2017, which triggered the commencement of a negotiation process between the UK and the EU in respect of the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The initial deadline for this withdrawal process was 29 March 2019. This deadline was subsequently extended to 31 October 2019 and then again to 31 January 2020.",p,
"On 17 October 2019, the agreement on a negotiated withdrawal agreement was endorsed by leaders at a special meeting of the European Council. The negotiated withdrawal agreement provides for a transition or implementation period. The negotiated withdrawal agreement provides that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law will be applicable to and in the UK during the transition period. However, the UK government requires the approval of the UK Parliament in order to ratify the negotiated withdrawal agreement and, on 19 October 2019 the UK Parliament voted to withhold approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement until implementing legislation has been passed by the UK Parliament. Following the UK general election on 12 December 2019, the ruling Conservative Party significantly increased its majority in government. On 24 January 2020, the withdrawal agreement received royal assent and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. The UK is now in a transition period, lasting until 31 December 2020, to negotiate its new relationship with the EU.",p,
"It remains uncertain to what extent the UK and EU will be able to finalise negotiation of a future trading relationship ahead of 31 December 2020. The UK government has therefore commenced preparations for a “hard Brexit” or “no-deal Brexit” to minimise the risks for firms and businesses associated with an exit with no transitional agreement. This has included publishing draft secondary legislation under powers provided in the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to ensure that there is a functioning statute book in the event of a hard or no deal Brexit. Investors should be aware that the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes and/or the liquidity of the Notes may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors",p,
to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.,p,
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,
It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.,p,
"Following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 and subject to an agreement on (and the terms of) any future EU-UK relationship, EU laws (other than those EU laws transposed into English law (see below)) will cease to apply within the UK.",p,
"However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. The replacement of any such third parties that are no longer able to provide services to the Issuer may result in additional costs and expenses, which may in turn affect the amounts available to pay Noteholders.",p,
Regulatory Risk,p,
"Currently, under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EU and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to how, following a UK exit from the EU, and probably the EEA (whatever the form thereof), the existing passporting regime will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of the UK’s exit and the terms of any replacement relationship, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may, on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU will include arrangements for the continuation of the existing passporting regime or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Market Risk,p,
"Following the results of the Referendum, the financial markets have experienced volatility and disruption. This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Investors should be aware that the result of the Referendum and any subsequent negotiations, notifications, withdrawal and changes to legislation may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Exposure to Counterparties,p,
"The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that once the transition period ends following 31 December 2020, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the result of the Referendum, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see “Counterparty Risk” below.",p,
Ratings actions,p,
"Following the result of the Referendum, S&P and, Fitch and Moody’s have each downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and each of S&P and Fitch has placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.",p,
"The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, the recent downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.",p,
"While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see “Counterparty Risk” below.",p,
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES,h3,
2.1 Regulatory Initiatives,p,
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking” entities and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the",p,
"U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences.",p,
2.2 Basel III,h3,
"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework including increasing risk weights for asset backed securities. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of prior prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the European Union.",p,
"In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for globally systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB's risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework's standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
2.3 Securitisation Regulation,p,
Background,p,
"A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).",p,
"Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal regulatory or other requirements. No such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.",p,
Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors,p,
"The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (the “CRR”), insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).",p,
"These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified (among other things) that: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with Article 6 of the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the investors in accordance with Article 5 of the Securitisation Regulation; (ii) the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which, see “Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that article; and (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm (as defined in points",p,
"(1) and (2) of Article 4(1) MiFID II), the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.",p,
"Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge on the Notes acquired by the relevant investor. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remain unclear.",p,
Risk Retention Obligation,p,
"The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or of up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover (the “Pecuniary Sanctions”).",p,
Any such Pecuniary Sanction levied on the Retention Holder may materially adversely affect the ability of the Retention Holder to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.,p,
"With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – The Retention” below.",p,
Transparency Requirements,p,
"The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e. the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s transparency requirements in Article 7 (the “EU Transparency Requirements”). The reporting entity must make certain prescribed information available to holders of a securitisation position, to the relevant Competent Authorities and, upon request, to potential investors.",p,
"Under the EU Transparency Requirements, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing. It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form (which may be subject to change following pricing) by way of a website (currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee any Hedge Counterparty or any other person gives any assurance as to whether Competent Authorities will determine that such disclosure is sufficient for the purposes of the Securitisation Regulation.",p,
"The EU Transparency Requirements also include ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) (“Inside Information”); and, where applicable, information on “significant events” (“Significant Events”).",p,
"The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not less than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.",p,
"On 16 October 2019, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards under Article 7(3) of the Securitisation Regulation (the “Transparency RTS”), which include detailed disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports and Investor Reports. Following approval by the European Parliament and the Council, the Transparency RTS will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal.",p,
"The transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the EU Transparency Requirements provide that until the application of the Transparency RTS, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the “CRA3 RTS”). Currently, there is no dedicated CRA3 RTS template for CLO transactions (other than with respect to content of Investor Reports set out in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS), nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS.",p,
"On 30 November 2018, the European Banking Authority (the “EBA”), ESMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (the “European Supervisory Authorities” or “ESAs”) published a joint statement (the “Joint Statement”) regarding the reporting templates to be used for the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports in the period until the Transparency RTS apply.",p,
"The ESAs stated that they expect Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.",p,
"In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) and make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the provision of the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports and following the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date through the provision of the Securitisation Regulation Reports (see “Description of the Reports”). The Joint Statement is not a legally binding document and there is currently uncertainty in relation to the legal position as regards the form of quarterly reporting until the date of application of the Transparency RTS. Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies the EU Transparency Requirements and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy the EU Transparency Requirements.",p,
Transparency Requirements – Collateral Manager and Issuer arrangements,p,
"In relation to the EU Transparency Requirements: (a) the Issuer will be designated as the reporting entity; (b) the Collateral Manager will undertake in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the EU Transparency Requirements. The Collateral Administrator shall make such reports and information available via a website currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and with the Issuer then notifying the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies to the Collateral Administrator (such certification to be in the form set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and which may, at the option of the Collateral Administrator, be given electronically, and upon which the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is: (i) the Issuer, (ii) the Arranger, (iii) the Initial Purchaser, (iv) the Trustee, (v) a Hedge Counterparty, (vi) the Collateral Manager, (vii) a Rating Agency, (viii) a Noteholder, (ix) a potential investor in the Notes or (x) a Competent Authority. The Issuer (with the consent of and in consultation with the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of the EU Transparency Requirements.",p,
"Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations are likely to apply to both the Collateral Manager as the sponsor as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer (to the extent the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer)), or by Collateral Manager, to fulfil the EU Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.",p,
The Collateral Manager is required to indemnify the Issuer for Collateral Manager Breaches in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Collateral Manager,p,
may be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager (See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement,p,
– Liability of the Collateral Manager” below).,p,
"If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the sponsor and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the sponsor may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
"Uncertainties in the Scope of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements",p,
"Aspects of the detail and effect of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements and what is, or will be, required to demonstrate compliance to Competent Authorities remain unclear. The EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements by an institution similar to the Retention Holder. Furthermore, any relevant regulator’s views with regard to the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.",p,
"Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
"No assurance can be given that the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.",p,
"Relevant investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the information described herein for the purposes of complying with any relevant requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agent, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any information described herein is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention Notes) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal or regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.",p,
2.4 U.S. Risk Retention Rules,h3,
"On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset- backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). On 9 February 2018, a three-judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favour",p,
"of the LSTA in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “LSTA Decision”). The Panel’s opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on 5 April 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on 3 April 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof.",p,
"As a result, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that it does not expect to be required to retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; provided, however, that the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes on the Issue Date, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements. Accordingly, investors will not be entitled to the protections previously afforded by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that required CLO collateral managers to have “skin in the game” and to comply with certain disclosure obligations specified in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.",p,
"No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for “open market CLOs”, and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,
"If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"In the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, whether as a result of regulatory action or governmental action or the LSTA Decision being overturned, the Collateral Manager (or a “majority-owned affiliate” thereof) may be required to acquire additional Notes (either in the secondary market or through an additional issuance of Notes). In addition, in the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, failure to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may have an adverse effect on the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates, as such failure could constitute a violation of the Exchange Act. Any such failure to comply may result in significant negative reputational consequences and may adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed or the market value and liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"In the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuer’s ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to the consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to each such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required under the Trust Deed with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any holders of Notes). At any time after the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager may (subject to the terms of the Trust Deed) direct the Issuer to effect an additional issuance of any Class of Notes for purposes of enabling the Collateral Manager to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (using any method the Collateral Manager has elected, in its sole discretion, to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, including, without limitation, by retaining an “eligible horizontal residual interest”, “eligible vertical interest” or a combination thereof) without the consent of any Noteholder. However, in such scenario, there is no guarantee that the Collateral Manager will take such action or that any such action would prevent the Collateral Manager from failing to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Furthermore, no Noteholder will have the right to purchase any such additional notes issued in connection with a Risk Retention Issuance and, therefore, may have their proportional holdings of Notes diluted in connection therewith.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their Affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future requirements.",p,
Japanese Retention Requirements,p,
"On 28 December 2018, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a proposal to introduce a risk retention requirement which would apply to certain categories of Japanese investors seeking to invest in securitisation transactions. A further notification regarding the proposal was published on 9 January 2019 (together, the “JRR Proposal”). The consultation period for the JRR Proposal ended on 8 February 2019, the final form of the Japanese Retention Requirements was published on 15 March 2019, which came into effect on 31 March 2019 (the “JRR Final Rules”).",p,
The JRR Final Rules provide that certain types of Japanese financial institutions should apply an increased regulatory capital risk weighting to a securitisation exposure unless such institution has established that the “originator” of the transaction retains a “securitisation exposure” in the transaction equal to not less than 5% of the total underlying assets by (i) retaining equal portions of each tranche or,p,
"(ii) holding all or part of the most junior tranche, in each case equal to at least 5% of the total underlying assets or (iii) if the most junior tranche represents less than 5% of the total underlying assets, holding both the entirety of such most junior tranche and equal portions of each of the more senior tranches so that the total amount held is equal to at least 5% of the total underlying assets (the “Japanese Retention Requirements”). For the purposes of the Japanese Retention Requirements, “originator” is defined as:",p,
(i) a person who is involved in the origination of underlying assets directly or indirectly or (ii) a sponsor of an ABCP conduit or other similar program which acquires exposures from third parties.,p,
"Under the JRR Final Rules, Japanese investors that are subject to the Japanese Retention Requirements face an increased capital charge if they invest in securitisation transactions which are found to be non- compliant, up to a maximum weighting of 1250%. The Japanese Retention Requirements would not apply where an investor is able to judge, by performing its own due diligence, that the origination of the underlying assets is appropriately conducted, based on various factors such as the originator’s involvement in the underlying assets and the quality of the underlying assets or any other relevant circumstances which show that the underlying assets were not “inappropriately formed”. The precise scope and application of these exceptions remains unclear.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the transaction described herein will be compliant with the Japanese Retention Requirements or any other applicable legal or regulatory requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements. Each investor should evaluate the impact that any such non-compliance may have on it before investing in the Notes.",p,
2.5 Retention Financing,h3,
"The Retention Holder or any of its Affiliates may from time to time enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the EU Retention Requirements (any such arrangements, the “Retention Financing Arrangements”) and in respect of any Retention Financing Arrangements, will either grant security over, or transfer title to, the Retention Notes in connection with such financing. If the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would retain the economic risk in the Retention Notes but not legal ownership of them. None of the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that such Retention Financing Arrangements will comply with the EU Retention Requirements. In particular, should the Retention Holder default in the performance of its obligations under the Retention Financing Arrangements, the lender or lenders thereunder would have the right to enforce the security granted by the Retention Holder, including effecting the sale or appropriation of some or all of the Retention Notes or, if the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would not be entitled to have the Retention Notes (or equivalent securities) returned to it. In exercising its rights pursuant to any Retention Financing Arrangements, any lender would not be required to have regard to the EU Retention Requirements and any such sale or appropriation may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non- compliant with the EU Retention Requirements. See “Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or",p,
Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates”. Such Retention Financing Arrangements may involve the provision of financing by a third party lender.,p,
"The term of any Retention Financing Arrangements may be considerably shorter than the effective term of the Notes, and separately, or as a result of other terms of the Retention Financing Arrangements may require the Retention Holder to repay or refinance the Retention Financing Arrangements whilst some or all Classes of Notes are Outstanding. If refinancing opportunities were limited at such time and the Retention Holder was unable to repay the retention financing from its own resources, the Retention Holder could be forced to sell some or all of the Retention Notes in order to obtain funds to repay the retention financing without regard to the EU Retention Requirements, and such sales may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements.",p,
2.6 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),h3,
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are “non-financial counterparties” (or third country entities equivalent to “financial counterparties” or “non-financial counterparties”).",p,
"Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) will, depending on the identity of their counterparty, be subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all OTC derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”), and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the “margin requirement”). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a financial counterparty, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements or restricting of their terms.",p,
"Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group”, excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial counterparties within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds, the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. Whilst the Hedge Transactions are expected to be treated as eligible hedging transactions and deducted from the total in assessing whether the notional value of OTC derivatives entered by the Issuer and/or non-financial entities within its “group”, exceeds the applicable thresholds, a regulator may take a different view. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.",p,
Clearing obligation,p,
"For major market participants grouped under “Category 1”, “Category 2” and “Category 3”, in respect of certain interest rate OTC derivative contracts denominated in the G4 currencies (euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen), the clearing obligation took effect from 21 June 2016, 21 December 2016 and 21 December 2018 respectively and have taken effect for other entities on 21 June 2019 (Category 3). In respect of certain index credit default swaps and interest rate swaps denominated in certain non-G4",p,
"European currencies, the clearing obligation has applied to Category 1, Category 2 and, in respect of index credit default swaps, Category 4 entities since 9 February 2017, 9 August 2017 and 9 May 2019 respectively. Key details in respect of the clearing obligation are provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards.",p,
Margin requirement,p,
"On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the “RTS”). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.",p,
"The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives, list exemptions from the rules and specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions. The margin rules will only apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold, requiring all in scope entities to collect and post variation margin and, for those counterparties/groups with the highest volumes of uncleared derivatives, require the collection of initial margin too. The previous intention was for the margin requirement to take effect on dates ranging originally from 1 September 2016 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). Following the December publication, for those entities with the biggest relevant derivatives portfolios i.e. above €3 trillion, the EMIR margin requirements (both initial and variation margin) took effect from 4 February 2017. Initial margin requirements will otherwise be phased in by reference to outstanding relevant uncleared derivatives until 1 September 2020 and the EMIR variation margin requirements generally took effect from 1 March 2017, following the same general timeline as the corresponding US, Japanese and Canadian requirements.",p,
"If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on the ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Collateral Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.",p,
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.,p,
"The Conditions allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to amend the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in future.",p,
"Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non-financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Currency Hedge Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
"Prospective investors should also note that EMIR has been subject to a review with a view to effect a number of amendments. In particular, a proposal published by the European Commission on 4",p,
"May 2017 to amend EMIR (the “Proposal”), envisaged that securitisation special purpose entities similar to the Issuer were to be reclassified as financial counterparties for the purposes of EMIR. On 15 November 2017, the Council of the European Union published its amendments to the Proposal (the “Compromise Proposal”) which were approved by the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on 5 March 2018. The Compromise Proposal deletes the inclusion of securitisation special purpose entities in the definition of financial counterparty. This position was confirmed in the text adopted by the European Parliament in plenary session on 12 June 2018. The European Parliament and the Council reached a political agreement on the Compromise Proposal on 5 February 2019 and on 1 March 2019 the Council published the final compromise text (the “EMIR Refit Regulation”). On 18 April 2019 the European Parliament approved the EMIR Refit Regulation, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 May 2019 and entered into force on 17 June 2019.",p,

2.7 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,h3,
The EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) regulates alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and provides in effect that each alternative investment fund (“AIF”) within the scope of the AIFMD must have a designated AIFM responsible for ensuring compliance with the AIFMD.,p,
"Although there is an exemption in AIFMD for “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”), the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, with regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, “registered financial vehicle corporations” within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as, or appoint, an AIFM unless the Central Bank issues further guidance advising them to do so.",p,
"If the Issuer is an AIF (which at this stage is unclear) then it would be necessary to identify its AIFM, which would be the entity which manages it in general and is therefore most likely to be the Collateral Manager. In such a scenario, the Collateral Manager would be subject to the AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Collateral Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Collateral Manager’s management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement as an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. If the Collateral Manager was to fail to, or be unable to, be appropriately regulated, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impair the ability of the Collateral Manager to manage the Issuer’s assets may adversely affect the Collateral Manager’s ability to carry out the Issuer’s investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.",p,
"If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as a “financial counterparty” under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including margin posting requirements) with respect to Hedge Transactions entered into after the relevant future effective dates.",p,
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.",p,
2.8 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,h3,
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has required and will continue to require many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the",p,
"U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect and regulators provide further guidance with respect thereto. In addition, the joint final rule implementing the U.S. Risk Retention Rules was adopted on 21 October and 22 October 2014. See 2.3 “Risk Retention and Transparency Requirements –",p,
U.S. Risk Retention Rules” above.,p,
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new Offering Circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,
"No assurance can be made that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.9 CFTC Regulations,h3,
"Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and in some cases traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements as may otherwise be required with respect to uncleared swaps, (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and (iv) reporting obligations and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders. Furthermore, regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in the United States on 1 March 2017. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending",p,
"on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging",p,
2.10 Commodity Pool Regulation,h3,
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”) and the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) if either (i) the Hedging Agreement Eligibility Criteria have been satisfied, or (ii) in respect of which, prior to entering into such Hedge Agreement, receipt by the Collateral Manager of legal advice from reputable legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements should not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Collateral Manager or its directors, officers or employees to register with the CFTC as a CPO or a CTA pursuant to the CEA (the “Hedging Condition”). No assurance can be given that a Hedge Agreement which complies with the Hedging Condition (including one that complies with the Hedging Agreement Eligibility Criteria will not cause the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer. Furthermore, once the final rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have been enacted or if there is any change in the rules and regulations in the future, the Hedging Agreement Eligibility Criteria may need to be reviewed and revised by reputable legal counsel at such time.",p,
"In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.",p,
"Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.",p,
2.11 Volcker Rule,h3,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from, among other things, (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments unless the transaction is excluded from the scope of the rule and/or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, certain investment entities referred to in the Volcker Rule as “covered funds”, subject to certain exemptions and exclusions. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain transactions with covered funds. Full conformance with the Volcker Rule was required from 21 July 2015.",p,
"A “banking entity” is defined to include a banking institution organised in the United States and any of its affiliates, regardless of where such affiliates is located or organised and also includes a banking institution organised outside the United States with a branch or agency office in the U.S. and any of its affiliates, regardless of where such affiliates are located.",p,
"A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on either section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager or collateral manager, general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors or similar governing body of the “covered fund”.",p,
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.9 “Commodity Pool Regulation”, above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by its CPO, also fall within the definition of a “covered fund” as described above.",p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer.",p,
"The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are, in each case, disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However,",p,
there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.,p,
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretive guidance on the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the applicable of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
"Earlier this year, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitisations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule’s covered fund provisions. It is unclear at this time what changes ultimately will be made to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Collateral Manager.",p,
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.,p,
2.12 CRA,h3,
"Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013. Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.",p,
2.13 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,h3,
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-",p,
"backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
2.14 Flip Clauses,h3,
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payments which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,
"The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, under the UK “anti-deprivation” laws, stating that, provided such provisions form part of a commercial transaction entered into in good faith which does not have as its predominant purpose, or one of its main purposes the deprivation of the property of one of the parties on bankruptcy, the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition there remain several",p,
actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.,p,
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payments, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payments would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payments are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payments, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,
2.15 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform,h3,
"The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has been reformed, with developments including:",p,
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);,p,
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers’ Association in February 2014;,p,
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and,p,
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.,p,
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.,p,
"In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.",p,
"The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.",p,
"It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.",p,
"The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, “EURIBOR”), together with LIBOR, and other so-called “benchmarks” are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.",p,
"Additionally, in March 2017, the European Money Markets Institute (formerly Euribor-EBF) (the “EMMI”) published a position paper referring to certain proposed reforms to EURIBOR, which reforms aim to clarify the EURIBOR specification, to develop a transaction-based methodology for EURIBOR and to align the relevant methodology with the Benchmarks Regulation (as defined below), the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks and other regulatory recommendations. The EMMI has since indicated that there has been a “change in market activity as a result of the current regulatory requirements and a negative interest rate environment” and “under the current market conditions it will not be feasible to evolve the current EURIBOR methodology to a fully transaction-based methodology following a seamless transition path”. It is the current intention of the EMMI to develop a hybrid methodology for EURIBOR.",p,
"In the EU, in September 2013, the Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.",p,
"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017.",p,
"In addition to the potential ramifications to the future of LIBOR resulting from the FCA’s announcement of 27 July 2017 outlined above, benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator. On 2 July 2019, EURIBOR was authorised under the Benchmarks Regulation and is now considered compliant with the Benchmarks Regulation.",p,
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):,p,
"(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and",p,
"(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.",p,
Investors should be aware that:,p,
"(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks",p,
"of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”;",p,
"(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:,p,
"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,
"(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;",p,
"(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Rated Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fall-back mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, without the consent of Noteholders, amend or waive the Transaction Documents upon terms satisfactory to the Collateral Manager in order to, (i) modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes from EURIBOR to an alternative base rate (such rate, the “Alternative Base Rate”, (ii) replace references to “LIBOR”, “EURIBOR”, “London Interbank Offered Rate” or “Euro Interbank Offered Rate” (or similar terms) to the Alternative Base Rate when used with respect to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, (iii) amend provisions which reference an index that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the index applicable to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation to the extent that no such equivalent is available and (iv) make such other amendments as are necessary or advisable in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager to facilitate the foregoing changes; provided that, (A) the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders (each acting by Ordinary Resolution) have consented to such modification, authorisation or waiver (provided that consent of the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders will not be required where the Alternative Base Rate is a Designated Base Rate) and (B) such amendments and modifications are being undertaken due to (x) a material disruption to LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark, (y) a change in the methodology of calculating LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark or (z) LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark ceasing to exist (or the reasonable expectation of the Collateral Manager that any of these events will occur. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and",p,
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Notes.,p,
"Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Floating Rate Notes.",p,
2.16 Financial Transaction Tax,h3,
"In February 2013 the Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (each, other than Estonia, “Participating Member States”). However, on 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.",p,
"Under the Commission Proposal, the proposed FTT would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State or the financial instrument in which the parties are dealing is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.",p,
"Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT.",p,
"On 10 October 2016, following a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the ten remaining Participating Member States, it was reported that an agreement in principle had been reached on certain key aspects of the FTT and that the EU Commission had consequently been asked to prepare draft FTT legislation on the basis of that agreement. However, the details of the FTT remain to be agreed. A written answer given by Pierre Moscovici in the European Parliament, speaking on behalf of the Commission on 28 April 2017, confirmed that negotiations between Participating Member States on the Commission’s proposal are continuing with a number of key areas still open for discussion, although the Commission’s intention was to assist Participating Member States reaching a compromise agreement during the course of 2017. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain.",p,
Additional Member States may also decide to participate in the FTT. Prospective Noteholders are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to any FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.,p,
2.17 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,h3,
"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted",p,
that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.,p,
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.",p,
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No. 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Eurozone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Eurozone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,

2.19 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,h3,
"At a meeting in Paris on 29 May 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Council at Ministerial Level adopted a declaration on base erosion and profit shifting urging",p,
"the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs to develop an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting in a comprehensive manner. In July 2013, the OECD launched an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), identifying fifteen specific actions to achieve this. Subsequently, the OECD published discussion papers and held public consultations in relation to those actions, also publishing interim reports, analyses and sets of recommendations in September 2014 for seven of the actions. On 5 October 2015, the OECD published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan, which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,
Action 6,p,
"The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” (“LOB”) rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule. Whether the Issuer will be subject to Danish corporation tax may depend on whether it can benefit from Articles 5 and 7 of the Denmark-Ireland double tax treaty. Further, it is expected that the Issuer will rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by Ireland to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply.",p,
"The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is unclear how a PPT, if adopted, would be applied by the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which payments are made to the Issuer.",p,
"In contrast, the LOB rule has a more objective focus. More particularly, the OECD has included both a detailed and simplified version of the LOB rule in its Final Report relating to Action 6, albeit recommending in the related commentary to the LOB rule that the simplified version of the LOB rule should be included in a double tax treaty in combination with a PPT rule. The more detailed version of the LOB provision would limit the benefits of treaties, in the case of companies and in broad terms, to:",p,
"(i) certain publicly listed companies and their affiliates; (ii) certain not-for-profit organisations and companies which carry on a pensions business; (iii) companies owned by a majority of persons who would be eligible for treaty benefits provided that the majority of the company’s gross income is not paid to a third country in a tax deductible form; (iv) companies engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business (other than of making or managing investments); (v) companies which were not established in a particular jurisdiction with a principal purpose of obtaining treaty benefits; and (vi) certain collective investment vehicles (“CIVs”). The simplified version of the LOB provision would limit these benefits to companies in similar but, generally speaking, less prescriptive circumstances. The ability to claim treaty benefits under (v) above, however, would be included in both versions, albeit that it would require a company to apply to the tax authorities of the other contracting state for the granting of that benefit.",p,
"Whilst the Final Report makes provision for the inclusion of a CIV as a “qualified person” for the purposes of the LOB rule, the Final Report does not include specific provision for non-CIVs, such as the Issuer. In the Final Report, the OECD acknowledges the economic importance of non-CIV funds and the need to grant such vehicles treaty benefits where appropriate. Further work on the treaty benefits to be afforded to non-CIV funds has continued to be undertaken including the publication on 24 March 2016 by the OECD of a public discussion draft document on the entitlement of non-CIV funds to treaty benefits. The OECD published a further public discussion draft on 6 January 2017, which included examples of common transactions involving non-CIV funds to help clarify the application of the principal purpose test. These examples were subsequently incorporated in the 2017",p,
update to the OECD Model Treaty and associated commentary published on 16 December 2017. This work may be relevant to the treaty entitlement of the Issuer.,p,
"The Multilateral Instrument (see further below) presents the PPT rule as the default option for countries wishing to modify their tax treaties to comply with the minimum standard of Action 6, while also permitting countries to supplement the PPT rule by choosing to apply a simplified LOB rule. The Multilateral Instrument does not include a detailed LOB rule but rather allows relevant countries who wish to incorporate a detailed LOB rule to opt out of the PPT rule and instead agree to endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement on such a detailed LOB rule. The Multilateral Instrument does not, however, address non-CIV funds and their access to treaty benefits in the context of a LOB rule.",p,
Action 7,p,
"The focus of another action point (Action 7) was to develop changes to the treaty definition of a permanent establishment and the scope of the exemption for an “agent of independent status” to prevent the artificial avoidance of having a permanent establishment in a particular jurisdiction. The Final Report on Action 7 sets out the changes that will be made to the definition of a “permanent establishment” in Article 5 of the OECD Model Convention and the OECD Model Commentary. Among other recommendations, the Final Report on Action 7 recommended two specific changes to the OECD Model Convention: (i) the expansion of the circumstances in which a “permanent establishment” is created to include the negotiation of contracts where certain conditions are satisfied; and (ii) narrowing the exemption for agents of independent status where contracts are concluded by an “independent agent” and that agent is connected to the foreign enterprise on behalf of which it is acting.",p,
"Whether the Issuer will be subject to Danish corporation tax may depend on, among other things, whether the Collateral Manager is regarded as an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the Ireland/Denmark double tax treaty. As at the date of this Offering Circular, it is expected that, taking into account the nature of the Collateral Manager’s business and the terms of its appointment and its role under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will be regarded as an agent of independent status, acting in the ordinary course of its business. The recommendations of the Final Report on Action 7 described above do not represent a BEPS “minimum standard” and, accordingly, Ireland and Denmark, both of whom have signed the Multilateral Instrument (see further below), are entitled to amend their tax treaties at their discretion. Ireland has exercised such discretion by reserving the right for Articles 12 (Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status through Commissionnaire Arrangements and Similar Strategies) and Article 14 (Splitting-up of Contracts) of the Multilateral Instrument not to apply. Ireland has also chosen to apply Option B of Article 13 (Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status through the Specific Activity Exemptions) of the Multilateral Instrument whilst Denmark has chosen to apply Option A of Article 13 of the Multilateral Instrument.",p,
Implementation of the recommendations in the Final Report,p,
"The OECD Action Plan noted the need for a swift implementation of any measures which are finally decided upon and suggested that Actions 6 and 7, among others, could be implemented by way of multilateral instrument, rather than by way of negotiation and amendment of individual tax treaties.",p,
"Subsequently, therefore, on 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included Ireland and Denmark (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument has been signed by over 90 jurisdictions (including Ireland and Denmark). It entered into force on 1 July 2018. The date from which provisions of the Multilateral Instrument have effect in relation to a particular treaty depends on several factors including the type of tax which the article relates to. The Multilateral Instrument was ratified by Ireland on 29 January 2019 and by Denmark on 30 March 2019. The Multilateral Instrument will have effect from 1 January 2020 in respect of withholding tax for Ireland and 1 November 2019 in respect of Irish other taxes and came into effect from 1 July 2019 in respect of Denmark and in respect of Danish other taxes.",p,
"Accordingly, at least some of the recommendations of the Final Reports on Actions 6 and 7 may be applied to existing tax treaties in a relatively short time. However, the Multilateral Instrument generally allows participating countries to opt in or out of various measures which are not a BEPS “minimum standard”. It remains to be seen, therefore, precisely which options participating countries will choose and, as the Final Report on Action 6 observed, there are various reasons why countries may not implement the proposed amendments in an identical manner and/or to the same extent.",p,
"In particular it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.",p,
"Investors should note that other action points (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.",p,
2.20 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive,h3,
"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The EU member states had until 31 December 2018 to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law. Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, broadly, provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti- Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU Member States and third countries (“Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either delay deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 needs to be implemented in the EU Member States’ national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and will have to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.",p,
"The Irish Finance Act 2019 includes legislation dealing with hybrid mismatches which came into effect on 1 January 2020. The implementation date for the interest limitation provision in Ireland is yet to be announced. Accordingly, the final form and impact of the interest limitation rule in Ireland remains uncertain.",p,
2.21 Taxation Implications of Contributions,h3,
"A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 7(k) (Reinvesting Noteholders). Subordinated",p,
Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Reinvestment Amount. Subordinated Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment to them of making a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 7(k) (Reinvesting Noteholders).,p,
2.22 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer,h3,
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish law, the Collateral Management Fees should be exempt from VAT in Ireland as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a “qualifying company” for the purposes of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act of Ireland 1997, as amended (“TCA”).",p,
"This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the VAT Directive), which provides that Member States shall exempt the management of “special investment funds” as defined by Member States.",p,
"The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 of Ireland, in the provisions implementing Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive, specifically lists, in the categories of undertakings to whom supplies of management services are exempt from VAT, undertakings which are “qualifying companies” for the purposes of section 110 of the TCA. The Issuer has been advised that it will be such a “qualifying company”, therefore management services supplied to it are exempt from VAT in Ireland under current law.",p,
"On 9 December 2015 the European Court of Justice handed down its judgment in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13 which concerned Dutch law on VAT, in particular the Dutch interpretation of the term “special investment fund” under the Directive, and could suggest that the exemption had been enacted by some EU member states more broadly than is permitted by the Directive. The Issuer is not, however, aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on Collateral Management Fees for entities such as the Issuer.",p,
2.23 Irish Tax Position of the Issuer,h3,
"The Issuer has been advised that it should fall within the Irish regime for the taxation of “qualifying companies” as set out in Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 of Ireland (as amended) (the “TCA”). As a result, it is anticipated that the Issuer should be subject to Irish corporation tax only on its profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice, after deducting all of its revenue expenses (including interest payable to the Noteholders in respect of the Notes). If, for any reason, the Issuer is not or ceases to be such a ‘qualifying company’ for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA, the Issuer could be obliged to account for Irish tax in respect of profits for Irish tax purposes, which are in excess of profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice. This could result in material tax being payable in Ireland which has not been contemplated in the cash flows in respect of the Notes issued to the Noteholders. In such circumstances, the Irish tax treatment of both the Issuer and payments by the Issuer in respect of the Notes could be adversely affected. In turn, this may therefore affect the return which the Noteholders receive on the Notes.",p,
"The Finance Act 2019 (effective from 1 January 2020) introduces a number of anti-avoidance provisions to Section 110 of the TCA in order to strengthen the existing protections against abuse of the regime and which, in certain circumstances, can deny a deduction for profit participating interest or interest in excess of a reasonable commercial return.",p,
2.24 The Common Reporting Standard,h3,
"The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial",p,
institutions (as defined) (“FIs”) relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.,p,
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implemented the CRS in a European context and created a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year (or from 2018 in the case of Austria).,p,
Ireland provided for the implementation of CRS through Sections 891F and 891G of the TCA. The Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 of Ireland (the “Regulations”) giving effect to the CRS from 1 January 2016 came into operation on 31 December 2015.,p,
"Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) are obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.",p,
"The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance, (iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.",p,
2.26 Regulated Banking Activity,h3,
"While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non-bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result",p,
"of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.27 Centre of Main Interests,h3,
"The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings (recast), states that in the case of a company, the place of its registered office shall be presumed to be its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in the absence of proof to the contrary and assuming the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.",p,
"In the decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ stated, in relation to the registered office presumption in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings, that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect”. As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland has Irish directors , is registered for tax in Ireland and has an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI is not located in Ireland and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, main insolvency proceedings may not be opened in Ireland.",p,
2.28 Irish Credit Servicing Act,h3,

"(b) managing or administering the credit agreement, including:",p,
"(i) notifying the relevant borrower of changes in interest rates or in payments due under the credit agreement or other matters of which the credit agreement requires the relevant borrower to be notified,",p,
"(ii) taking any necessary steps for the purposes of collecting or recovering payments due under the credit agreement from the relevant borrower,",p,
"(iii) managing or administering any of the following: (I) repayments under the credit agreement; (II) any charges imposed on the relevant borrower under the credit agreement; (III) any errors made in relation to the credit agreement; (IV) any complaints made by the relevant borrower; (V) information or records relating to the relevant borrower in respect of the credit agreement; (VI) the process by which a relevant borrower’s financial difficulties are addressed; (VII) any alternative arrangements for repayment or other restructuring; (VIII) assessment of the relevant borrower’s financial circumstances and ability to repay under the credit agreement; (IX) determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreement; (X) maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio,",p,
or,p,
(c) communicating with the relevant borrower in respect of any of the matters referred to in paragraph (b).,p,
Credit servicing firms are obliged by law to comply with certain Irish consumer and SME protections and rules issued by the Central Bank when undertaking ‘credit servicing’ activities.,p,
"If the Issuer holds or acquires the legal title to Relevant Loans and is not authorised or otherwise entitled to act as a credit servicing firm under the Central Bank Act 1997 (as amended), then it would be in breach of the Central Bank Act 1997 (as amended) unless an exemption applies. There is a limited exemption for securitisation special purpose entities, which is subject to certain conditions.",p,
"On 14 March 2018 the European Commission published a proposal for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral. This provides for, amongst other things, the regulation of credit servicers.",p,
Examinership,p,
"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court.",p,
"The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.",p,
"During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.",p,
"In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders.",p,
"If an examiner were appointed in respect of the Issuer, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:",p,
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;,p,
"(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;",p,
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and,p,
"(d) if a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.",p,
Preferred Creditors,p,
"Under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security that may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (that may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) that have been approved by the Irish courts. See “Examinership” above.",p,
"The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company (that would include the Issuer) may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those that the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.",p,
"Where notice has been given to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 calendar days of its creation by the holder of the security, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of VAT) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.",p,
"The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax, whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",p,
"In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company that are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.",p,
"The essence of a fixed charge is that the chargor does not have liberty to deal with the assets that are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer, any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.",p,
"In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables, it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated",p,
bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the moneys standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.,p,
"Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security purported to be created by the Trust Deed would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.",p,
"Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:",p,
"they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;",p,
"as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up;",p,
they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;,p,
the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and,p,
they rank after fixed charges.,p,
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES,h3,
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,
"Neither the Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of their affiliates) is under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,
"In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.",p,
3.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,h3,
"The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans, secured senior bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans, secured senior bonds and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional",p,
redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.,p,
3.3 The Notes are Subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class,h3,
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:,p,
"(a) on any Business Day on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, either (x) at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (y) at the direction in writing of the Collateral Manager;",p,
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution; or,p,
"(c) on any Payment Date in whole but not in part at the written direction of (x) the Controlling Class or (y) the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event,",p,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out herein. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).,p,
"In addition, subject to certain conditions set out herein, Refinancing Proceeds may be used to redeem all Classes of Rated Notes in whole or in part by Class on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period at the written direction of the Collateral Manager or the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Subordinated Noteholders/Collateral Manager).",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that the Subordinated Noteholders will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the other Agents or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer and, at the direction of the Collateral Manager, the Trustee shall amend the Trust Deed to the extent necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Notes (other than the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution). No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the Subordinated Noteholders who do not direct such redemption).",p,
"The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.",p,
"The Rated Notes may also be redeemed in whole but not in part by the Issuer if directed in writing by the Collateral Manager, at the applicable Redemption Prices, on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period if, upon or at any time following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, the Aggregate Principal Balance is less than 20 per cent. of the Target Par Amount provided that the Subordinated Noteholders shall not have objected to such redemption by way of Ordinary Resolution within 25 days of the Issuer giving notice thereof to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).",p,
"In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes or, in certain circumstances, that losses",p,
"would not be incurred on Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.",p,
"Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payments. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing. In addition, a Refinancing may result in a Class of Rated Notes having a shorter maturity date than other Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
3.4 The Notes are Subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Collateral Manager,h3,
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion notifies the Trustee that it has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. See Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption). The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes,h3,
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Noteholders of the Rated Notes or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including an Effective Date Rating Event, the breach of any of the Coverage Tests and a Special Redemption. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests), Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption) and Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event).",p,
3.6 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early,h3,
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following an Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager notifies the Issuer that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.,p,
3.7 The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period,h3,
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio – Management of the Portfolio – Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period” below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,
3.8 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and an Event of Default,h3,
(a) Additional Issuances,p,
"At any time, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Retention Holder, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (solely in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) to be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account and applied for a Permitted Use. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).",p,
(b) Redirection of funds to reinvestment,h3,
"The Collateral Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payments, redirect funds (including by deferring or waiving payment of some or all of its Collateral Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses or by the Issuer purchasing Rated Notes pursuant to Condition 7(l) (Purchase).",p,
(c) Reinvestment Amounts,h3,
"At any time during the Reinvestment Period, Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 7(k) (Reinvesting Noteholders) by making a cash contribution to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will decide (in consultation with the relevant Subordinated Noteholder but at the discretion of the Collateral Manager) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.",p,
(d) Collateral Manager Advances,h3,
"The Collateral Manager or its Affiliate or designee, at its discretion, may make loan advances in Euro to the Issuer during the Reinvestment Period in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Conditions and the Trust Deed, provided that (i) no Reinvestment Amounts have been advanced and (ii) the Class F Par Value Ratio is at least equal to 103.35% on the date of such advance. Any such advance may only be made for the purpose of (i) designating as Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, to be applied in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, or (ii) acquiring or exercising rights under one or more Collateral Enhancement Obligations. Each Collateral Manager Advance will bear interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus a margin of 2.0 per cent. per annum. Repayment by the Issuer of any Collateral Manager Advance will only be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No more than three Collateral Manager Advances may be made. Each Collateral Manager Advance shall be in an amount no less than €100,000 and the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Collateral Manager Advances shall not, at any time, exceed €10,000,000. See “Description of the Portfolio – Collateral Manager Advances”.",p,
"Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent an Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations” below).",p,
3.9 Limited Recourse Obligations,h3,
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following,p,
"enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any other Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any other Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders and (g) lastly, the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
"In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, examinership, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer.",p,
3.10 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,h3,
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) position was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.",p,
3.11 Subordination of the Notes,h3,
"Except as described below, the Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes, and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.",p,
"Except as described below, the payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account in the event that the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"Non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class X Notes or the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute an Event of Default (where such non- payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days). Failure to pay Interest Amounts on any other Class of Notes shall not constitute an Event of Default, unless, following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class. In such circumstances, the Controlling Class, which in these circumstances will be the Class A Noteholders (or, following redemption and repayment of the Class A Notes in full, the Class B Noteholders), acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default).",p,
"In the event of any acceleration of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, such Notes will be subject to automatic acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case subject to the terms of Condition 11 (Enforcement), be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Subordinated Noteholders, then by the Class F Noteholders, then by the Class E Noteholders, then by the Class D Noteholders, then by the Class C Noteholders, then by the Class B Noteholders and, finally, by the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that, other than any provision thereof which specifies that the Trustee must consider the interests of the Noteholders of each Class of Notes or whether any act, matter or thing is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class, in the event of any conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of (i) the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, and (vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee",p,
"receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by principal amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that, except as expressly provided otherwise in any applicable Transaction Document or thee Conditions, the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class where the Noteholders of the Class or Classes having priority over such other Class do not, in the opinion of the Trustee, have an interest in the subject matter of such directions) (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes. In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).",p,
3.12 Amount and Timing of Payments,h3,
"Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts on any Class of Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payments by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not be an Event of Default unless and until: (a) such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days (as described in Condition 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest)); and (b) in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, such non-payment of interest is in respect of a Payment Date on or after the Payment Date (the “Relevant Payment Date”) immediately following a Frequency Switch Event and: (i) in the case of non-payment of interest due and payable on the Class C Notes in respect of any Payment Date on or after the Relevant Payment Date, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes have been redeemed in full; (ii) in the case of non-payment of interest due and payable on the Class D Notes in respect of any Payment Date on or after the Relevant Payment Date, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes have been redeemed in full; (iii) in the case of non-payment of interest due and payable on the Class E Notes in respect of any Payment Date on or after the Relevant Payment Date, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes have been redeemed in full; and (iv) in the case of non-payment of interest due and payable on the Class F Notes in respect of any Payment Date on or after the Relevant Payment Date, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes have been redeemed in full, save in each case as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon as set forth in Condition 9 (Taxation).",p,
"Unless a Frequency Switch Event has occurred and the relevant Class of Notes is the Controlling Class at such time, the Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes in full on any Payment Date, in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
"Unless a Frequency Switch Event has occurred and the relevant Class of Notes is the Controlling Class at such time, in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount which would, but for the first paragraph of Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) otherwise be due and payable in respect of such Class on any Payment Date will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class, and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will not be an Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which such Class of Notes is to be redeemed in full.",p,
"Non-payment of interest and principal due and payable on the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payments will not constitute an Event of Default. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,
"Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
3.13 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited,h3,
"The Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,
3.14 Calculation of Floating Rate of Interest,h3,
"If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Floating Rate of Interest in respect of the Floating Rate Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Floating Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Floating Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period; provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Floating Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, relevant Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Floating Rate of Interest on any other basis.",p,
3.15 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,h3,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering",p,
"Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.",p,
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations,p,
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Notes.",p,
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.",p,
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the Arranger,p,
"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.",p,
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely",p,
affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.,p,
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (the “Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.,p,
Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes,p,
"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-",p,
"10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is presently unclear what, if any, services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,
3.16 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,h3,
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling on 20 April 2033 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral",p,
"Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.",p,
"Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain",p,
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, the other Agents or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,
3.17 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes,h3,
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by Subordinated Noteholders, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See “Mandatory Redemption of the Notes” above.",p,
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,
3.18 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,h3,
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of an Event of Default on or about that date.",p,
3.21 Withholding Tax on the Notes,h3,
"So long as the Notes remain listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin or another recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA and the Paying Agent in respect of the Notes is not resident in Ireland, no withholding tax should be imposed in Ireland on payments of principal or interest on the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) and Condition 9 (Taxation), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any appropriate tax forms and other documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.",p,
"If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes (including the FATCA), the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.",p,
"In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
3.22 Security,h3,
"Clearing Systems: Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.",p,
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the other Agents, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.",p,
"Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
"3.23 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",h3,
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected (i) at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders, (ii) by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing or (iii) by electronic consent in accordance with the operating procedures of the Clearing Systems and the provisions of the Trust Deed. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.",p,
"If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 662/3 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting to consider an Ordinary Resolution, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.",p,
"Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will not constitute or form part of the Controlling Class, will not have any voting rights with respect to, and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting: (i) on any CM Removal Resolution; (ii) on any CM Replacement Resolution; or (iii) in respect of any assignment or delegation of any of the Collateral Manager’s rights or obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. No Collateral Manager Notes shall be entitled to vote or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting: (i) on any CM Removal Resolution or (ii) in respect of any assignment or delegation of any of the Collateral Manager’s rights or obligations",p,
under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. No Collateral Manager Notes will be entitled to vote in respect of any CM Replacement for Cause Resolution or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting in respect of such CM Replacement for Cause Resolution.,p,
"Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class B-2 Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class B-2 Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.",p,
"Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of “Controlling Class”.",p,
"Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.",p,
"Investors in the Class X Notes should note that the Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions, and the Class X Notes will not, at any point, be or form part of the Controlling Class.",p,
"Certain amendments, modifications, supplements, waivers and authorisations of the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and/or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document may be made without the consent of the Noteholders (other than any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver and/or authorisation that has the effect of sanctioning a Basic Terms Modification). Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, the Collateral Quality Tests, the S&P Tests Matrix or the Moody’s Test Matrix and the related definitions, provided that (each to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification, Waiver and Authorisation)) an officer of the Collateral Manager has certified to the Trustee that such modification or amendment would not materially adversely affect the interests of Noteholders of any Class of Notes, Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained, the consent of the Noteholders of each Class of Rated Notes (voting separately) acting by Ordinary Resolution has been obtained and the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution has been obtained.",p,
"Certain entrenched rights relating to the Conditions, including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payments, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution, cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.",p,
"In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents which, in its opinion, are of a formal, minor or technical nature, are made to correct a manifest error, or are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class, without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee (and subject to certain other conditions being satisfied), without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification, Waiver and Authorisation).",p,
"Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent may be required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. The Hedge Agreements may allow a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request. During such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer may not be able to make such modification, amendment or supplement and therefore implementation thereof may be delayed. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent a modification of the Transaction Documents which would otherwise have been beneficial to, or in the best interests of, certain of the Noteholders.",p,
3.24 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes,h3,
"If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and the appointment of a successor Collateral Manager are at the direction of holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.25 Enforcement Rights Following an Event of Default,h3,
"If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.",p,
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it (or an agent or Appointee appointed by it, which may be the Collateral Manager) determines, subject to consultation by the Trustee or such agent or Appointee with the Collateral Manager (unless the Collateral Manager is the Appointee), determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payments; or otherwise (B) in the case of an Event of Default specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iv) of Condition 10 (Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default.",p,
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement,p,
"thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.26 Certain ERISA Considerations,h3,
"Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes and which likely includes the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled “Certain ERISA Considerations” below.",p,
3.27 Forced Transfer,h3,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA and laws and regulations applicable to other plans.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule 144A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”), the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder demanding that such holder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Noteholder within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period,",p,
"(a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a commercially reasonable sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.",p,
"In addition, the Trust Deed provides that:",p,
"(a) if any Noteholder is determined by the Issuer to be a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder, such Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder may be required by the Issuer, within 10 days of receipt of notice from the Issuer, to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer.

3.28 U.S. Tax Risks,h3,
U.S. trade or business,p,
"The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. However, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants by acquiring certain assets (for example, a “United States real property interest” or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership or other flow through for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to an Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
FATCA,p,
"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income of certain of its assets. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information (including the identity of its direct or indirect holders or beneficial owners) with respect to, certain holders of the Note to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. Each purchaser, holder and beneficial owner of Notes agrees, or will be deemed to agree, that the Issuer, the Trustee or their agents or representatives may (1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, the IRS and any other relevant tax authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Issuer achieves FATCA Compliance. The Issuer expects to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. For example, the Issuer may not be considered to comply with FATCA if more than 50% of the Subordinated Notes (and any other Classes of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) are owned by a person that is, or is affiliated with, a foreign financial institution that is not compliant with FATCA. however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.",p,
"If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required to be requested by the Issuer or any of its agents (in the sole discretion of the Issuer or such agent) for the Issuer to achieve FATCA Compliance, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to fail to achieve FATCA Compliance, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any amounts withheld from payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership of Notes, and (B) except with respect to the Retention Holder’s ownership of Retention Notes, to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if such Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer or any of its agents, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges and any taxes",p,
"incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to such Noteholder as payment in full for such Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a Noteholder’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to achieve FATCA Compliance. See Conditions 2(j) (Forced Transfer Pursuant to FATCA).",p,
United States Tax Characterisation of the Notes,p,
"Upon the issuance of the Notes, White & Case LLP will deliver an opinion generally to the effect that under current law, assuming compliance with the Transaction Documents, and based on certain assumptions and factual representations made by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, Class C Notes and the Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be given in respect of the Class F Notes, although the Issuer intends to treat the Class F Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Note, each Noteholder (and any beneficial owners of any interest therein) will be deemed to have agreed, to treat the Rated Notes as debt of the Issuer and the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer, in each case for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law and for certain limited purposes. The determination of whether a Note will or should be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the Note is issued. Prospective investors should be aware that the classification of an instrument as debt or equity is highly factual, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise any particular Class or Classes of the Rated Notes as equity in the Issuer. If any of the Notes were treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences might apply.",p,
"The Issuer is expected to be treated as a passive foreign investment company, and may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purpose",p,
"The Issuer is expected to be a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which means that a U.S. holder of any Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to adverse tax consequences, which may be mitigated if such U.S. holder elects to treat the Issuer as a qualified electing fund and to recognise currently its proportionate share of the Issuer’s income whether or not distributed to such U.S. holder. In addition, depending on the overall ownership of interests in the Issuer, a U.S. holder of 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or 10 per cent. Or more of the combined value, directly or by attribution, of any Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be treated as a U.S. shareholder in a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) and required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the “subpart F income” of the Issuer, whether or not distributed to such U.S. holder. A U.S. holder that makes a qualified electing fund election, or that is required to include subpart F income in the event that the Issuer is treated as a CFC, may recognise income in amounts significantly greater than the payments received from the Issuer. Taxable income may exceed cash payments when, for example, the Issuer uses earnings to repay principal on the Notes or accrues income on the Collateral Obligations prior to the receipt of cash or the Issuer discharges its debt at a discount. A U.S. holder that makes a qualified electing fund election or that is required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the subpart F income of the Issuer will be required to include in current income its pro rata share of such earnings, income or amounts whether or not the Issuer actually makes any payments to such Noteholder. The Issuer will cause its independent accountants to provide any U.S. holder, upon request by such U.S. holder, with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. holder would need to make a qualified electing fund election and/or to comply with the CFC rules.",p,
Possible treatment of the Rated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes,p,
"One or more Classes of Notes, and in particular the more junior Classes of Notes, could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any such Rated Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of such Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax.",p,
U.S. Noteholders (as defined in “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective “qualified,p,
electing fund” election with respect to their Rated Notes. See “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes,p,
– Possible Treatment of Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes.”,p,
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain,p,
"The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). There are a significant number of technical issues and uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and application of the TCJA, which may be clarified by future guidance. It is not possible to predict whether such clarifications will result in adverse consequences to the Issuer or to investors in the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note, including with respect to the effects of the TCJA and to monitor future guidance issued with respect to the TCJA and any other potential amendments to relevant tax law. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” below.",p,
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL,h3,
4.1 The Portfolio,p,
"The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and the Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of (x) the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on any Measurement Date falling on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date and (y) the Class F Par Value Test which is required to be satisfied after the Reinvestment Period) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser have made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their respective Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which",p,
ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.,p,
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,h3,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Loans, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date,h3,
"On behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date pursuant to a financing arrangement (the “Warehouse Arrangements”). The Warehouse Arrangements were provided by senior lenders, mezzanine lenders and a junior noteholder (the “Warehouse Providers”) which include the Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager or affiliates thereof. Some of the Collateral Obligations may have been acquired from the Warehouse Providers. The Warehouse Arrangements must be",p,
"terminated in all respects on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements must be repaid on or prior to the Issue Date, including from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Warehouse Providers in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date.,p,
"The prices paid for such Collateral Obligations will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date.",p,
"In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Providers on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during such period provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Providers.",p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only (i) other than in respect of any Issue Date Collateral Obligation, at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Obligation is entered into and (ii) in respect of Issue Date Collateral Obligations, on the Issue Date and, in each case in respect of certain of the Eligibility Criteria that comprise the Restructured Obligation Criteria, in relation to any Restructured Obligation, on the applicable Restructuring Date. Any failure by such Collateral Obligation to satisfy the relevant Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.",p,
Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period,p,
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy, as at the Effective Date, each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of (x) the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on any Measurement Date falling on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date and (y) the Class F Par Value Test which is required to be satisfied after the Reinvestment Period), Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests and Target Par Amount requirement. See “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Currency Hedge Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter",p,
"into Currency Hedge Transactions. See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non- confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the Subordinated Noteholders. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
"Investors should note that, at any time prior to the Determination Date related to the first Payment Date, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, transfer some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to the Unused Proceeds Account. Such transfer may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders on the first Payment Date.",p,
4.4 Prepayment Risk,h3,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
4.5 Defaults and Recoveries,h3,
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans or High Yield Bonds and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans or High Yield Bonds often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance",p,
"providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and/or High Yield Bonds therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.",p,
Recoveries on Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below.,p,
"For the purpose of the foregoing “Senior Obligations” means Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Loans.",p,
4.6 Underlying Portfolio,h3,
"Characteristics of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds",p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, the Collateral Principal Amount, must consist of either “not less than” or “not more than” certain specified percentages of particular categories of Collateral Obligations including Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds. Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or share purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. High Yield Bonds are also generally unsecured. Secured Senior Loans usually have shorter",p,
"terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Secured Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond or a High Yield Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example, High Yield Bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Interest Rate Risk” below.",p,
"The majority of Senior Loans and Second Lien Loans bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Secured Senior Loan or Second Lien Loan may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Secured Senior Loan or Second Lien Loan, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
"Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Secured Senior Loan or Unsecured Senior Loan which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Secured Senior Bond or a High Yield Bond which is not waived by the requisite majority of the holders thereof is normally an event of default which may trigger the acceleration of the bonds or loans. Although any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, High Yield Bonds and Unsecured Senior Loans",p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Secured Senior Loan or an Unsecured Senior Loan, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Secured Senior Loan or Unsecured Senior Loan, and the private syndication thereof, such Secured Senior Loans and Unsecured Senior Loans are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Secured Senior Loans and Unsecured Senior Loans have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan",p,
"trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Unsecured Senior Loans is also generally less liquid than that for Secured Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Secured Senior Loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Secured Senior Loan.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants. Ownership of Cov- Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.",p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.",p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and",p,
"means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.",p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in-possession” financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,
Investing in Unsecured Senior Loans involves certain risks,p,
"Unsecured Senior Loans are unsecured obligations of the applicable obligor, may be subordinated to other obligations of the obligor and generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with investment grade obligations and secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loan occurs, the holders of such Unsecured",p,
"Senior Loan will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the obligor.",p,
4.7 Corporate Rescue Loans,h3,
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,
4.8 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,h3,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of (i) all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payments rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the amount of any Reinvestment Amounts contributed by a Reinvesting Noteholder and deposited into the Supplemental Reserve Account during the Reinvestment Period in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed and (iii) the proceeds from any issue of additional Subordinated Notes in accordance with Condition 17(b) (Additional Subordinated Notes).",p,
"The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.",p,
To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the,p,
"Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
4.9 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,h3,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
"4.10 Participations, Novations and Assignments",h3,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.",p,
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,
"Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest of the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.",p,
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” above.",p,
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.,p,
4.11 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,h3,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
4.12 Counterparty Risk,h3,
"Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"If a Hedge Counterparty or its guarantor is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating",p,
"withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. If the Hedge Counterparty is unable to do so and/or the Issuer is unable to enter into a Replacement Hedge Transaction, this may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure as relating to the Notes or its currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations. For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.",p,
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” above.,p,
4.13 Concentration Risk,h3,
"Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio – Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.",p,
4.14 Credit Risk,h3,
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,
4.15 Interest Rate Risk,h3,
"It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.",p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there may be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, a floating rate basis mismatch (including in the case of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments which pay a floating rate based on a benchmark other than",p,
"EURIBOR), maturity date mismatch and mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “Commodity Pool Regulation”, “CFTC Regulations” and “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above and provided that the relevant Hedge Counterparty has the regulatory capacity to enter into derivative transactions with Irish residents. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Interest Rate Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer’s exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"In addition, some Collateral Obligations permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations re-set to semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”) (at all times other than following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event when interest on the Notes will switch to semi- annual pay). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing mismatch.",p,
"In the case of the Notes which will bear interest at a rate based on EURIBOR for the period from one Payment Date (or, in the case of the first Payment Date, the Issue Date) to the next Payment Date (the “Floating Rate Notes”), there may be a timing mismatch between the Floating Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Collateral Obligations as the interest rate on such Floating Rate Collateral Obligations may adjust more frequently or less frequently, on different dates and based on different indices as compared to the interest rates on the Floating Rate Notes. As a result of such mismatches, an increase in the level of EURIBOR could adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and the Eligible Investments will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes.",p,
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to",p,
"reimburse the Account Bank in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payments and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,
4.16 Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions,h3,
Currency Risk,p,
The Notes are denominated in Euro and the Rated Notes (other than the Class B-2 Notes) bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. The Class B-2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 10 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Non-Euro Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limits set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non-Euro Obligation.,p,
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations are required to be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). Any termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “CFTC Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.",p,
"Furthermore, the terms of the Currency Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Currency Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Currency Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. See further “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.,p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.",p,
"The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,
4.17 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,h3,
"To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In some circumstances the cash balances invested in short-term investments may accrue negative interest so that the Issuer is obliged to make payments to the institution with which such short-term investments are made. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations (see “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period” above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount. Any decrease in the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the",p,
"Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by Subordinated Noteholders and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
4.18 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,h3,
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a CCC Obligation, a Caa Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restrictions in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating of Collateral Obligations. In some instances, the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor. In some cases, the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating in respect of a Collateral Obligation will be based on a confidential credit estimate determined separately by S&P and/or Moody’s. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. Please see “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.",p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations, Caa Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
4.19 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,h3,
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.",p,
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.,p,
4.20 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,h3,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
4.21 Loan Repricing,h3,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Class.",p,
4.22 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,h3,
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than U.S. withholding taxes on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees,",p,
"consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) or, if and to the extent that any such withholding can be eliminated in full by application being made under an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise or (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make “gross up” payments to the issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding on an after tax basis (and in the case of Participations, neither payments to the Selling Institutions nor payments to the Issuer will be subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction unless the Obligor is required to make “gross up” payments that compensate the Issuer directly or indirectly in full for any such withholding on an after-tax basis). However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor (or, in the case of Participations, the Selling Institutions) will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made or (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the relevant Obligor.",p,
"In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax (if no corresponding gross up payment is received) would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest, principal on the Maturity Date and other amounts payable in respect of the Notes of each Class. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders/Collateral Manager).",p,
4.23 Danish Taxation of the Issuer,h3,
"In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to Danish corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in Denmark or (ii) carries on trade in Denmark through a permanent establishment.",p,
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in Denmark provided the effective management and control of the Issuer does not take place in Denmark and thus provided the Collateral Manager does not effectively conduct any management decisions on behalf of the Issuer. Hence all decision making and managerial power with respect to the Issuer’s activities must remain with the Issuer.,p,
The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in Denmark if it has a fixed place of business in Denmark or it has an agent in Denmark who has and habitually exercises authority in Denmark to do business on the Issuer’s behalf.,p,
"The Issuer should not be subject to Danish corporation tax as a consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that (i) the Issuer has no premises available for business purposes in Denmark inclusive through the offices of the Collateral Manager, (ii) the members of the Issuer’s management are separate from the management of the Collateral Manager and vice versa and (iii) the management of the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager, as applicable, are separate from the ownership of the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager, as applicable. Furthermore, the Issuer should not be subject to Danish corporation tax as a consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out in its capacity of independent portfolio manager provided that the Collateral Manager carries out the activity within its ordinary course of its business, the Collateral Manager carries the entrepreneurial risk of the activity performed and Collateral Manager acts for a number of other clients in addition to the Issuer that are not legally or economically dependent on the Issuer.",p,
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as having a permanent establishment in Denmark it will most likely not be subject to Danish tax other than in respect of dividends from Danish companies, if the Issuer qualifies as an “investment company” in accordance with Article 3(1) (19) of the Danish Corporation Tax Act.",p,
"According to new Danish legislation, a trust established outside of Denmark will be subject to Danish taxation if the seat of management of the trust is, or is deemed to be, Denmark. According to the law,",p,
"this may be the case if the trust is actually administrated from Denmark. However, a concrete assessment must be made based upon the actual place where daily management decisions take place. It is at this stage unclear whether the new law will have any actual impact on the taxation of the Issuer or whether the taxation of the Issuer qualifying as an “investment company” will be limited to tax on dividends according to Article 3(1) (19) of the Danish Corporation Tax Act.",p,
4.24 Collateral Manager,h3,
"The Collateral Manager is given authority by the Issuer in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as collateral manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio” and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The powers and duties of the Collateral Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Risk Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work-outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See “The Portfolio”. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time will, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, be limited to a review of readily available public information and in respect of Collateral Obligations which are bonds which are not publicly listed, any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of bonds and, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are Assignments or Participations of Senior Loans and in relation to which the Collateral Manager has non-public information, such analysis will include due diligence of the kind common in relation to loans of such kind. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Obligations will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of assets.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.",p,
"The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own other than entry into the Warehouse Arrangements. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,
"The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.",p,
"The Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement will be owed solely to the Issuer (and, to the extent of the Issuer’s security assignment of its rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trustee). The Collateral Manager will not be in contractual privity with, and will owe no separate duties or obligations to, any of the Noteholders under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Actions taken by",p,

"The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described herein under “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.",p,
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.,p,
"The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,
4.25 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing,h3,
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,
4.26 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations,h3,
"The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations during the Initial Investment Period. The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.",p,
"Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral",p,
"Obligations in any successive rolling 12-month period as well as any Exchanged Equity Security, Equity Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Risk Obligation or a Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the Subordinated Noteholders and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
4.27 Valuation Information; Limited Information,h3,
"None of the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or the Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non- public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.",p,
4.28 Recharacterisation of Trading Gains,h3,
"The Collateral Manager may, at its sole discretion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, direct that Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments are instead deposited into the Interest Account. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. As a result, such Trading Gains would not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations. See Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account).",p,
5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,h3,
"The Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,
Collateral Manager,p,
"Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment and other activities of the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person, from their investing for their own accounts or for the accounts of others and from the Collateral Manager participating in the structuring of the transaction and from it acting as a Warehouse Provider.",p,
"The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates may at certain times seek to purchase or sell investments from or to the Issuer as principal. The Collateral Manager, at its option and sole discretion, may effect principal transactions between such entities. The Collateral Manager may (on behalf of the Issuer), subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, acquire a Collateral Obligation from, or sell a Collateral Obligation, Equity Security or Eligible Investment to, the Collateral Manager, any of its Affiliates or any account or portfolio for which the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates serve as investment advisor for fair market value (an “Affiliate Transaction”). At the written request of the Collateral Manager, the Issuer shall establish a conflicts review board or appoint an independent third party to act on behalf of the Issuer (such board or party, an “Independent Review Party”) with respect to Affiliate",p,
"Transactions. Decisions of any Independent Review Party shall be binding on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and the Noteholders. Any Independent Review Party (a) shall either: (i) be an established financial institution or other financial company with experience in assessing the merits of transactions similar to the Affiliate Transactions; or (ii) be a review board comprised of one or more individuals selected by the Issuer (or at the request of the Issuer, selected by the Collateral Manager); (b) shall be required to assess the merits of the Affiliate Transaction and either grant or withhold consent to such transaction in its sole judgement; and (c) shall not be: (i) affiliated with the Collateral Manager (other than as a Noteholder or as a passive investor in the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer); or (ii) involved in the daily management and control of the Issuer.",p,
"The Issuer (i) shall be responsible for any reasonable fees relating to the services provided by any Independent Review Party and shall reimburse members of any Independent Review Party for their out- of-pocket expenses and (ii) may indemnify members of such Independent Review Party to the maximum extent permitted by law, subject to terms and conditions satisfactory to the Collateral Manager.",p,
"The Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person may invest in securities or obligations that would be appropriate as Collateral Obligations and may be buyers or sellers of credit protection that reference Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons also either currently serve as or expect to serve as collateral manager or investment advisor for, act as a general partner to, or invest in or are or expect to be affiliated with other entities which invest in, underwrite or originate high yield bonds and loans, including those organised to issue collateral debt obligations similar to those issued by the Issuer. In providing services to other clients, the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may recommend activities that would compete with or otherwise adversely affect the Issuer. In the course of managing the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer, the Collateral Manager may consider its relationships with other clients (including companies the securities of which are pledged to secure the Notes) and Collateral Manager Related Persons and its own interests as a Warehouse Provider to the Issuer in the period prior to the Issue Date. The Collateral Manager may decline to make a particular investment for the Issuer in view of such relationships. The Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may make investment decisions for its clients and Collateral Manager Related Persons that may be different from those made by such persons on behalf of the Issuer, even where the investment objectives are the same or similar to those of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may at certain times be simultaneously seeking to purchase or sell the same or similar investments for the Issuer and another client for which the Collateral Manager or any of them serves as investment adviser or collateral manager, or for themselves. Likewise, the Collateral Manager may on behalf of the Issuer make an investment in an issuer or obligor in which another account, client, the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person is already invested or has co- invested. The Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person may purchase Notes, creating potential conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person that holds Notes, on the one hand, and other investors in Notes, on the other hand. The Collateral Manager may, in its discretion, give priority over the Issuer in the allocation of investment opportunities to certain accounts or clients designated by the Collateral Manager in its discretion and to other accounts or clients of the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons to the extent obligated or permitted by the application of regulatory requirements, internal policies and client guidelines and/or principles of fiduciary duty. The Collateral Manager does not owe any fiduciary duty to the Issuer, the Noteholders or any other Secured Party. Neither the Collateral Manager nor any Collateral Manager Related Person has any obligation to obtain for the Issuer any particular investment opportunity, and the Collateral Manager may be precluded from offering to the Issuer particular investment opportunities in certain situations including, without limitation, where the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may have a prior contractual commitment with other accounts or clients or as to which the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person possesses material, non-public information, or may be limited in its ability to effect transactions for or on behalf of the Issuer. There is no assurance that the Issuer will hold the same investments or perform in a substantially similar manner as other funds with similar strategies under the management of the Collateral Manager. There is also a possibility that the Issuer will invest in opportunities declined by the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons for the accounts of others or for",p,
"their own accounts. In making investments on behalf of accounts or clients that the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons manage or advise either now or in the future, the Collateral Manager in its discretion may, but is not required to, aggregate orders for the Issuer with orders for such other accounts, notwithstanding that depending upon market conditions, aggregated orders can result in a higher or lower average price.",p,
"Although the Collateral Manager and certain of its officers and employees will devote such time and effort as may be reasonably required to enable the Collateral Manager to discharge its duties to the Issuer under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, they will not devote all of their working time to the affairs of the Issuer. As part of their regular business, the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Manager Related Persons may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions both for their respective accounts and for the accounts of their respective clients, in a principal or agency basis, with respect to loans, securities and other investments and financial instruments of all types. No provision in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement prevents the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons from rendering services of any kind to any person or entity, including the issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Obligations and their respective Affiliates, the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and the Hedge Counterparties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons and the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Manager Related Persons may, among other things: (a) serve as directors, partners, officers, employees, agents, nominees or signatories for any issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Obligations;",p,
"(b) receive and retain fees for services rendered to the issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Obligations or any Affiliate thereof; (c) be retained to provide services unrelated to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to the Issuer and be paid therefor; (d) be a secured or unsecured creditor of, or hold an equity interest in, any issuer of any obligation included in the Collateral Obligations; (e) sell or terminate any Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments to, or purchase or enter into any Collateral Obligations from, the Issuer while acting in the capacity of principal or agent;",p,
"(f) serve as a member of any “creditors’ board” with respect to any obligation included in the Collateral Obligations which has become or may become a Defaulted Obligation; (g) underwrite, act as distributor of, or make a market in any Collateral Obligation, provided that with respect to such market, the Collateral Manager is not acting as agent for the Issuer; (h) provide investment advisory services to their clients; and (i) maintain other relationships with any issuer or obligor or Affiliate of any issuer or obligor of any obligations included in the Collateral. Services of this kind may lead to securities laws restrictions on transactions in such securities by the Issuer and otherwise create conflicts of interest for the Issuer and may lead individual officers or employees of the Collateral Manager to act in a manner adverse to the Issuer. In such instances, the Collateral Manager, and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons and their respective officers and employees may in their discretion make investment recommendations and effect investment decisions that may be the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer’s investments. In connection with any such activities described above, the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Manager Related Persons and their respective officers and employees may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions in securities or investments of a type that may be suitable to be included as Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager and the Collateral Manager Related Persons and their respective officers and employees will not be required to offer such securities or investments to the Issuer or provide notice of such activities to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager is also entitled to retain fees and commissions in connection with work-out, restructuring, arrangement and underwriting fees.",p,
"The Collateral Manager’s ability to buy obligations (on behalf of the Issuer) for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell obligations which are part of the Portfolio may be restricted by limitations contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) may be unable to buy or sell obligations or to take other actions that the Collateral Manager might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders. The Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Manager Related Persons may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others, which may include, without limitation, serving as investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being Affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by securities such as the Notes and other trusts and",p,
"pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with securities issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager may furnish investment management and advisory services to others who may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Collateral Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own securities which are the same type as the Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person may also have ongoing relationships with the issuers of Collateral and they or their clients may own equity or other securities or obligations issued by issuers of Collateral. In addition, the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person either for its own accounts or for the accounts of others, may invest in securities or obligations that are senior to, junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities or obligations that are acquired on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
"The Collateral Manager shall act as Retention Holder and shall undertake to hold the Retention Notes. There is no restriction on the ability of the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person to acquire additional Notes of any Class at any time. It is possible that the Collateral Manager and/or one or more Collateral Manager Related Persons may, from time to time, acquire Notes in addition to the Retention Notes held by the Retention Holder. The interests and incentives of the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person that is a Noteholder may conflict with or be adverse to the interests and incentives of the holders of other Classes of Notes. In addition, if a Collateral Manager Related Person owns any Notes, the Collateral Manager or an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager, to the extent they act as investment adviser of the relevant Collateral Manager Related Person, will exercise the rights thereof as holder of such Notes in accordance with any duty of care to such Collateral Manager Related Person, which may conflict with or be adverse to the interests and incentives of other Noteholders. Such purchases of Notes, on the Issue Date or subsequently (as applicable), may create potential and/or actual conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person and other investors in the Notes. Resulting conflicts of interest could include (a) divergent economic interests between the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person, on the one hand, and other investors in the Notes, on the other hand, and (b) voting of Notes by the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons, or a recommendation to vote by the same, to cause, among other things, an early redemption of the Notes and/or an amendment of the transaction documents relating to the Notes.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may enter into agreements (including side letters) with one or more holders of the Notes pursuant to which the Collateral Manager may agree, subject to its obligations under the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and applicable law, to take actions with respect to such holders of the Notes that it will not take with respect to other holders of the Notes, including, without limitation, varying fee structures and allowing for varying arrangements with respect to the scope and frequency of information provided about the Portfolio. Unless specifically negotiated, other Noteholders will not have the right to review (or receive the economic or other benefits of) any such agreements or side letters.",p,
Clients of the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates may act as counterparty with respect to Hedge Transactions and Participations or as party to or in connection with the investment of any funds in Eligible Investments.,p,
"The Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person may also have ongoing relationships with, render services to or engage in transactions with, companies whose securities are pledged to secure the Notes and may own equity or debt securities issued by issuers of and other Obligors on Collateral Obligations. As a result, a Collateral Manager Related Person may possess information relating to issuers of Collateral Obligations which is not known to the individuals at the Collateral Manager responsible for monitoring the Collateral Obligations and performing the other obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. In addition, a Collateral Manager Related Person may invest in loans and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations that are purchased to secure the Notes. It is intended that all Collateral Obligations will be purchased and sold by the Issuer on terms prevailing in the market.",p,
Neither the Collateral Manager nor any Collateral Manager Related Person is under any obligation to offer investment opportunities of which they have become aware to the Issuer or to account to the Issuer (or share with the Issuer or inform the Issuer of) any such transaction or any benefit received by them from any such transaction.,p,
"Furthermore, the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may make an investment on behalf of any account that they manage or advise without offering the investment opportunity to or making any investment on behalf of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons have no affirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before offering any investments to other funds or accounts that the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons manage or advise. Furthermore, Affiliates of the Collateral Manager may make an investment on their own behalf without offering the investment opportunity to, or the Collateral Manager making any investment on behalf of, the Issuer. Affirmative obligations may exist or may arise in the future, whereby Affiliates of the Collateral Manager are obliged to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that such Affiliates manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager offering those investments to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will endeavour to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities in a manner which it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances. Although the professional staff of the Collateral Manager will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager deems appropriate to perform its duties in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, those staff may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s other accounts.",p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may effect transactions between the Issuer and other entities (including other CLO issuers) in respect of which the Collateral Manager or an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager acts as collateral manager. The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may conduct principal trades with itself and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons, subject to applicable law. The Collateral Manager may also effect client cross transactions where the Collateral Manager causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and a Collateral Manager Related Person. Client cross transactions enable the Collateral Manager to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Issuer at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavourable price movement that may be created through entrance into the market with such purchase or sell order. In addition, the Issuer has agreed to permit cross transactions subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, subject as provided above, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross transactions where any Collateral Manager Related Person acts as investment manager or adviser or broker for, and may receive commissions or other compensation from both the Issuer and the other party to the cross transaction, and will have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities with respect to both parties to the transaction.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of a Collateral Manager Related Person which differ from those effected with respect to the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager may often be seeking simultaneously to purchase or sell investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as investment manager or for Collateral Manager Related Persons, and the Collateral Manager will have the discretion to apportion such purchases or sales among such entities. Prior to the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager may effect acquisitions of Collateral Obligations or enter into binding commitments to purchase Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer, from funds or other CLOs in relation to which Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S, or any of its Affiliates, may be the investment manager or may exercise investment discretion in relation thereto. The Collateral Manager cannot assure equal treatment across its investment clients. When the Collateral Manager determines that it would be appropriate for the Issuer and one or more Collateral Manager Related Persons to participate in an investment opportunity or sell an investment, the Collateral Manager will seek to execute orders for all of the participating investment accounts, including the Issuer and its own account, on an equitable basis. If the Collateral Manager has determined to invest or sell at the same time for more than one of the Collateral Manager Related Persons, the Collateral Manager will generally place combined orders for all such Collateral Manager Related Persons simultaneously and if all such orders are not filled at the same price, it will use reasonable efforts to allocate such purchases and sales in an equitable manner and in accordance with applicable law. Similarly, if an order on behalf of more than one Collateral Manager Related",p,
"Person cannot be fully executed under prevailing market conditions, the Collateral Manager will allocate the investments traded among the Issuer and Collateral Manager Related Persons on a basis that it considers equitable. Situations may occur where the Issuer could be disadvantaged because of the investment activities conducted by the Collateral Manager for the Collateral Manager Related Persons.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may participate in creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or work out of issuers of Collateral Obligations. In such circumstances, the Collateral Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Collateral Manager Related Persons that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager will be entitled to receive any steering committee fees associated with a bankruptcy, restructuring or work out (except any fees received in connection with the extension of the maturity of a Defaulted Obligation or a reduction in the outstanding principal balance of a Defaulted Obligation) received in connection with the work out or restructuring of any Defaulted Obligations or Collateral Obligations.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager and/or any Collateral Manager Related Person may own equity or other securities of Obligors of Collateral Obligations and may have provided investment advice, collateral management and other services to issuers of Collateral Obligations. From time to time, the Collateral Manager may, on behalf of the Issuer, purchase or sell Collateral Obligations through the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates. In connection with the foregoing activities, the Collateral Manager may from time to time come into possession of material non-public information that limits its ability to effect a transaction for the Issuer, and the Issuer’s investments may be constrained as a consequence of the Collateral Manager’s inability to use such information for advisory purposes or otherwise to effect transactions that otherwise may have been initiated on behalf of its clients, including the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons shall have no general obligation to seek to obtain any material non-public information about any issuer of obligations. The Issuer may invest in the securities of companies Affiliated with the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person or companies in which the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person has an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding and sale of such investments by the Issuer may enhance the profitability of the Collateral Manager and/or a Collateral Manager Related Person’s own investments in such companies. It is possible that one or more Collateral Manager Related Person may also act as counterparty with respect to one or more Participations.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may from time to time consult with, receive input from and provide information to third parties (who may or may not be or become direct and indirect owners of the Notes) in respect of obligations being considered for acquisition by the Issuer. Some of those same third parties may have interests adverse to those of the Noteholders and may take a short position (for example, by buying protection under a credit default swap) relating to any such obligations or securities. The Collateral Manager may also have discussions with investors from time to time. The views expressed in such discussions may influence the composition of the Portfolio and there can be no assurance that (i) a holder of any Notes would agree with any views expressed by other investors in such discussions; (ii) the views expressed by some investors will not be more influential than the views of other investors; or",p,
"(iii) any modifications made to the Portfolio as a result of such discussions will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Obligations. This Offering Circular does not contain any information relating to the individual Collateral Obligations that will comprise the initial portfolio or that may secure the Notes from time to time.",p,
There is no limitation or restriction on the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates with regard to acting as collateral manager (or in a similar role) to other parties or persons. This and other future activities of the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.,p,
"In certain circumstances, the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates may receive compensation in connection with the investment of assets in certain Eligible Investments from the managers of such Eligible Investments. In addition, the Issuer may from time to time invest in Eligible Investments issued by, arranged by or underwritten by the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates.",p,
"The Collateral Manager is entitled to the Senior Collateral Management Fee, the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee and in certain circumstances, the Incentive Management Fee, subject to the",p,
"Priorities of Payments as described herein and the availability of funds therefor. By reason of the Incentive Management Fee, the Collateral Manager may have a conflict between its obligation to manage the Portfolio prudently and the financial incentive created by such fees for the Collateral Manager to make investments that are riskier or more aggressive than would be the case in the absence of such fees.",p,
Rating Agencies,p,
"S&P and Moody’s have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates,p,
"Each of the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates (the “BNPP Parties”) will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction and in other roles described below.",p,
"The BNPP Parties have been involved (together with the Collateral Manager) in the formulation and development of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests, the Priorities of Payments and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. These may be influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have or have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes.",p,
"The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. The Initial Purchaser may elect in its sole discretion to rebate a portion of its fees in respect of the Notes to certain investors, including the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager. The Initial Purchaser may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Initial Purchaser expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,
"The BNPP Parties may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market. The BNPP Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The financial services that the BNPP Parties may provide also include financing and, as such, the BNPP Parties may in future provide financing to the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates. The BNPP Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of any such financings. In the case of any such financing, the BNPP Parties may have received security over the assets of the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates, resulting in the BNPP Parties having enforcement rights and remedies in relation to such financing which may include the right to appropriate or sell such secured assets. The BNPP Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the BNPP Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the BNPP Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the holders of the Notes or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of obligors affiliated with the BNPP Parties or in which one or more BNPP Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the BNPP Party’s own investments in such obligors.",p,
"From time to time the Collateral Manager (pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and on behalf of the Issuer) will purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the BNPP Parties and one or more BNPP Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participations and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The BNPP Parties may act as initial purchaser, arranger, lead manager and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.",p,
"The BNPP Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, BNPP Parties and employees or customers of the BNPP Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to or referencing the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or the obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a BNPP Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a BNPP Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a BNPP Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,

Exchange for Definitive Certificates,h3,
Exchange,p,

Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems,p,
"Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be). The Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any payment in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate, the common depositary by whom such Note is held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the relevant Participants’ or accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Certificate as shown on the records of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by Direct Participants in any Clearing System to owners of beneficial interests in any Global Certificate held through such Direct Participants in any Clearing System will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Save",p,
"as aforesaid, such persons shall have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the Notes for so long as the Notes are represented by such Global Certificate and the obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the registered holder, as the case may be, of such Global Certificate in respect of each amount so paid.

Settlement and Transfer of Notes,p,
"Subject to the rules and procedures of each applicable Clearing System, purchases of Notes held within a Clearing System must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for such Notes on the Clearing System’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each such Note (the “Beneficial Owner”) will in turn be recorded on the Direct Participant and Indirect Participant’s records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from any Clearing System of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct Participant or Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Notes held within the Clearing System will be effected by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in such Notes, unless and until interests in any Global Certificate held within a Clearing System is exchanged for Definitive Certificates.",p,
"No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Notes held within such Clearing System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the Clearing Systems to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.",p,

Pre-issue Trades Settlement,p,
"It is expected that delivery of Notes will be made against payment therefor on the Issue Date thereof, which could be more than three Business Days following the date of pricing. Settlement procedures in other countries will vary. Purchasers of Notes may be affected by such local settlement practices and purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes between the date of pricing and the relevant Issue Date should consult their own adviser.",p,
RATINGS OF THE NOTES,h3,
General,p,
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Notes (except for the Subordinated Notes) be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class X Notes “AAAsf” from S&P and “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s; “the Class A Notes “AAAsf” from S&P and “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s; the Class B-1 Notes: “AAsf” from S&P and “Aa2” from Moody’s; the Class B-2 Notes: “AAsf” from S&P and “Aa2” from Moody’s; the Class C Notes: “Asf” from S&P and “A2(sf)” from Moody’s; the Class D Notes: “BBB-sf” from S&P and “Baa3(sf)” from Moody’s; the Class E Notes: “BB-sf” from S&P and “Ba3(sf)” from Moody’s; and the Class F Notes: “B-sf” from S&P and “B3(sf)” from Moody’s. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.,p,
"The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.",p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.",p,
S&P Ratings,h3,
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:,p,
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;,p,
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and,p,
(c) legal considerations.,p,
"Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the period beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the expiry of the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”) which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P's proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,
"There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, or the Retention Holder, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.",p,
"S&P's Ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.",p,
Moody’s Ratings,h3,
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.,p,
"Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.",p,
"In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.",p,

The Investment Committee currently comprises Henrik Nordby Christensen (chairman), Mads Christian Romild, Andres Garcia Bartolome, Christian Grane, Magnus Bruun Jacobsen, and Rajiv Thaker. Among other things, the Investment Committee underwrites the credit risk of portfolio assets.",p,
Investment Strategy,h3,
Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S will manage the Portfolio using fundamental and other analysis subject to the relevant criteria set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S’s objective in managing the Portfolio is (a) to satisfy the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes and the Transaction Documents in a timely manner; (b) to at least maintain the initial ratings of the Notes; and (c) (subject to (a) and (b) above and to the protection of the interests of the Rated Notes) to maximise the return to the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"In order to achieve the above objectives, Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S maintains a defensive approach towards its investments by emphasising risk control through:",p,
(a) undertaking comprehensive due diligence and credit analysis;,p,
(b) careful portfolio construction with an emphasis on minimising cross-correlations on salient risk parameters;,p,
(c) maintaining on-going monitoring of credits and sectors by the analysts;,p,
"(d) portfolio managers’ monitoring of portfolios, market conditions, and transaction structure with a view towards anticipating positive and negative credit events; and",p,
(e) active portfolio management and swift selling of credit deteriorated and underperforming assets.,p,
Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S also considers it a priority in meeting its objectives that it has and maintains a strong and experienced management team that understands investing in credit within structural constraints.,p,
Comprehensive Due Diligence and Credit analysis,h3,
"Investment decisions by Accunia Fondsmæglerselskab A/S are based on rigorous credit review and relative value analysis performed by the analysts and the portfolio managers. Potential investments are analysed on the merits of the individual company relative to its position in the industry and the general strength of the industry within the context of the overall economy. Credit analysis includes, but may not be limited to, an analysis of the key drivers of revenue, expense, cash flow and sources and uses of working capital. Investment due diligence is done by the analysts and results in a written investment proposal documenting an investment thesis based on, among other things, due diligence performed, review of historical operational and financial information and the industry status of such potential investment, and where applicable, information presented in bank meetings, offering memoranda, management meetings and financial data. When deemed appropriate, the due diligence process may include interviews with management and controlling shareholder(s), review of external and proprietary research and on-site visits.",p,
Investment Process,h3,
"New investment opportunities are pre-reviewed to assess general quality, value and fit relative to the needs of the Portfolio. Assets that are viewed favourably are then made subject to further investment due diligence by the analysts, which results in a written investment proposal, which is delivered to the portfolio management team. The portfolio managers then ensure that the proposal is adequately comprehensive and covers all applicable eligibility criteria and, if appropriate, sends the proposal to the Investment Committee for approval. The Investment Committee approves maximum asset exposure unanimously subject to a four member quorum. The Investment Committee generally meets at least weekly but as often as is necessary to discuss potential new investments and existing positions whenever action is required. As part of its investment decision, the Investment Committee also takes into consideration an analysis of a Collateral Obligation’s potential impact on the Portfolio’s structure.",p,
Investment Monitoring and Risk Management,h3,
"The analysts and portfolio managers maintain the credit monitoring process. Individual investment performance is benchmarked against the initial investment thesis, giving consideration to new financial information, market news, price or other events. As part of an overall risk management strategy, a watch list is maintained and monitored which is derived from general market information including security prices, company press releases, news and statements and ongoing due diligence. The watch list is also used as part of its investment decision process to forecast the occurrence of specific credit events and model the impact of credit events on a portfolio, given the structure of the related investment vehicle. When deemed appropriate, ongoing monitoring may include meetings with management and advisors. In performing credit monitoring processes, various software, publications and third-party monitoring services may be used.",p,

Promptly after receipt of written notice from the Collateral Manager of such auction, the Trustee will provide notice (in such form as is prepared by the Collateral Manager) to the Noteholders of an auction, setting forth in reasonable detail a description of each Unsaleable Asset and the following auction procedures: (i) any Noteholder may submit a written bid within 10 Business Days after the date of such notice to purchase one or more Unsaleable Assets no later than the date specified in the auction notice (which will be at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice, and with a copy to the Collateral Manager); (ii) each bid must include an offer to purchase for a specified amount of cash on a proposed settlement date no later than 20 Business Days after the date of the auction notice; (iii) if no Noteholder submits such a bid within the time period specified under clause (i) above, unless the Collateral Manager determines that delivery in kind is not legally or commercially practicable and provides written notice thereof to the Principal Paying Agent, the Principal Paying Agent will provide notice thereof to each Noteholder and offer to deliver (at such Noteholder’s expense) a pro rata portion (as determined by the Collateral Manager) of each unsold Unsaleable Asset to the Noteholders or beneficial owners of the most senior Class that provide delivery instructions to the Collateral Administrator on or before the date specified in such notice, subject to minimum denominations; provided that, to the extent that minimum denominations do not permit a pro rata distribution, the Collateral Administrator will distribute the Unsaleable Assets on a pro rata basis to the extent possible and the Collateral Manager will select by lottery the Noteholder or beneficial owner to whom the remaining amount will be delivered and deliver written notice thereof to the Collateral Administrator; provided, further, that the Collateral Administrator will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect delivery of such interests; and (iv) if no such Noteholder or beneficial owner provides delivery instructions to the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Administrator will promptly notify the Collateral Manager and offer to deliver (at the cost of the Collateral Manager) the Unsaleable Asset to the Collateral Manager. If the Collateral Manager declines such offer, the Collateral Administrator will take such action as directed by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in writing to dispose of the Unsaleable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means.",p,
"“Unsaleable Assets” means (a)(i) a Defaulted Obligation, (ii) an Equity Security or (iii) an obligation received in connection with an Offer, in a restructuring or plan of reorganisation with respect to the obligor, in each case, in respect of which the Issuer has not received a payment in cash during the preceding 12 months or (b) any Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment identified in an officer’s certificate of the Collateral Manager as having the product of its Principal Balance and Market Value less than Euro 1,000, in the case of each of (a) and",p,
(b) with respect to which the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without further enquiry or liability) that (x) it has made commercially reasonable efforts to dispose of such obligation for at least 90 days and (y) in its commercially reasonable judgment such obligation is not expected to be saleable in the foreseeable future.,p,
Amendments to Collateral Obligation Stated Maturities of Collateral Obligations,p,
"The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment: (a) the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity Date of the Rated Notes; and (b) the Weighted Average Life Test is satisfied as determined by the Collateral Manager. If the Issuer or the Collateral Manager has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements of this paragraph but by way of scheme of arrangement or otherwise, the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity has been extended, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may but shall not be required to sell such Collateral Obligation provided that in any event the Collateral Manager shall dispose of such Collateral Obligation prior to the Maturity Date. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.",p,
"“Maturity Amendment” means with respect to any Collateral Obligation, any waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of such Collateral Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, a waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the credit facility of which a Collateral Obligation is part, but would not extend the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation held by the Issuer, does not constitute a Maturity Amendment.",p,
Expiry of Reinvestment Period Certification,p,
"Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Obligations.",p,
Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test,p,
"If, on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) to (V) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test has not been met, Interest Proceeds shall be applied to the payment to the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds for the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations, in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and (y) the amount which, after giving effect to such payment, would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be satisfied if recalculated immediately following such payment.",p,
Designation for Reinvestment,p,
"After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Collateral Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.",p,
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (i) Purchased Accrued Interest; and (ii) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.,p,
Accrued Interest,p,
"Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment, which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute “Purchased Accrued Interest” and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.",p,
Block Trades,p,
The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Obligations on any day in the event that such Collateral Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.,p,
"For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria at the election of the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Obligation or a group of Collateral Obligations) identified by the Collateral Manager as such at the time (the “Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date”) when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a “Trading Plan”) may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the ten Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the “Trading Plan Period”); provided that:",p,
"no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value);",p,
no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date;,p,
no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period;,p,
no two Collateral Obligations included in a Trading Plan may have a difference in Collateral Obligation Stated Maturities of more than 3 years;,p,
no Collateral Obligation included in a Trading Plan may have a Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of less than twelve months; and,p,
"if the Reinvestment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan, but are not satisfied upon the completion of the related Trading Plan, Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P and Moody’s is obtained with respect to the effectiveness of additional Trading Plans (it being understood that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall only be required once following any failure of a Trading Plan);",p,
"provided further that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligations purchased at separate times for purposes of determining whether any particular Collateral Obligation is a Discount Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria upon completion of a Trading Plan pursuant to (f) above, shall be calculated with respect to those Collateral Obligations that were actually sold and/or purchased as part of the relevant Trading Plan on the basis of data used as at the Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date.",p,
Eligible Investments,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account and the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.",p,
Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time, purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Obligations being so purchased.",p,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or by means of a Collateral Manager Advance. Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Supplemental Reserve Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise: (i) interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid",p,
"into the Supplemental Reserve Account during the Reinvestment Period pursuant to the Priorities of Payments rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders (and such Collateral Manager Advances as the Collateral Manager makes in its discretion), as a “Supplemental Reserve Amount” subject to the limits set out in the definition thereof; (ii) the amount of any Reinvestment Amounts contributed by a Reinvesting Noteholder and deposited into the Supplemental Reserve Account during the Reinvestment Period in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed and (iii) the proceeds from any issue of additional Subordinated Notes in accordance with Condition 17(b) (Additional Subordinated Notes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations may be sold at any time by the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, and all Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments.",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test or Collateral Quality Tests.",p,
Collateral Manager Advances,p,
"The Collateral Manager or its Affiliate or designee, at its discretion, may make loan advances in Euro to the Issuer during the Reinvestment Period in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Conditions and the Trust Deed, provided that (i) no Reinvestment Amounts have been advanced and (ii) the Class F Par Value Ratio is at least equal to 103.35% on the date of such advance. Any such advance may only be made for the purpose of (i) designating as Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, to be applied in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, or (ii) acquiring or exercising rights under one or more Collateral Enhancement Obligations. Each Collateral Manager Advance will bear interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus a margin of 2.0 per cent. per annum. Repayment by the Issuer of any Collateral Manager Advance will only be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Each Collateral Manager Advance shall be in an amount no less than €100,000 and the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Collateral Manager Advances shall not, at any time, exceed €10,000,000. No more than three Collateral Manager Advances may be made.",p,
Exercise of Warrants and Options,p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may, at any time exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall on behalf of the Issuer instruct the Account Bank through an Issuer Order (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) to make any necessary payment out of amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account.",p,
Margin Stock,p,
"The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavours to sell any Collateral Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Collateral Enhancement Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.",p,
"“Margin Stock” means margin stock as defined under Regulation U issued by the Federal Reserve Board, including any debt security which is by its terms convertible into Margin Stock.",p,
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire Collateral Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euros) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.,p,
"Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee",p,
"or other ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof in the event of any default by the obligor thereof in respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder. Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations. To the extent required, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a third party from time to time as collateral for any reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt of an Issuer Order (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) the Trustee shall release such amounts from the security granted thereover pursuant to the Trust Deed.",p,
Participations,p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:",p,
the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution will not exceed the individual percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party (or any guarantor thereof); and,p,
"the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions (or any guarantor thereof), each having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating,",p,
"and for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Obligation.",p,
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a sub-participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of: the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan,p,
Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);,p,
the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or,p,
"such other documentation,",p,
"provided that, in each case, such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as the Trust Deed.",p,
Assignments,p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Assignment is acquired the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).",p,
“Assignment” means an interest in a loan acquired directly by way of novation or assignment.,p,
Bivariate Risk Table,p,
"The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) as referred to in “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any",p,
"Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the Moody’s or S&P ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.",p,

(iii) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test; and so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding:,p,
(i) the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test; and,p,
"(ii) the Weighted Average Life Test,",p,
each as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.,p,
S&P Test Matrices,p,
"Subject to the provisions provided below, the Collateral Manager has the option to elect which weighted average recovery rate (a “Recovery Rate Case”) and which applicable weighted average spread (the “S&P Test Matrix Spread”) set forth below (each such Recovery Rate Case and S&P Test Matrix Spread together a “S&P Test Matrix” and each such S&P Test Matrix together the “S&P Test Matrices”) will be applicable for purposes of the S&P CDO Monitor Test.",p,
"After the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager may request for S&P to provide S&P CDO input files (“S&P CDO Input Files”) for up to 10,000 combinations of S&P Test Matrix Spreads and Recovery Rate Cases. On two Business Days’ written notice to the Collateral Administrator (or such shorter time as may be acceptable to the Collateral Administrator), the Collateral Manager may choose a different Recovery Rate Case or a different S&P Test Matrix Spread (or both); provided that the Collateral Obligations must be in compliance with such different Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread, as applicable, and, solely for purposes of this proviso, if the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to invest in a Collateral Obligation, compliance with the newly selected Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread, as applicable, may be determined after giving effect to such investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Collateral Obligations are not currently in compliance with the Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread then applicable and would not be in compliance with any other Recovery Rate Case or S&P Test Matrix Spread, as applicable, the Collateral Manager may select a different Recovery Rate Case or a different S&P Test Matrix Spread (or both), as applicable, that is not further out of compliance than the current Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread, as applicable.

The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,p,
"The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).",p,
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse,p,
portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows:,p,
an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;,p,
"a “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;",p,
an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;,p,
an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each of Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and,p,
"an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.",p,
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.,p,

The Securitisation Regulation Report shall be made available via a secured website currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator or such other third party entity compiling such reports to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, and the Hedge Counterparties from time to time with the Issuer notifying the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders) which shall be accessible to any Competent Authority or any person who certifies to the Collateral Administrator (or such other third party entity compiling such reports) (such certification to be in the form set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and which may, at the option of the Collateral Administrator, be given electronically, and upon which the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is: (i) the Issuer, (ii) the Arranger, (iii) the Initial Purchaser, (iv) the Trustee, (v) a Hedge Counterparty, (vi) the Collateral Manager, (vii) a Rating Agency, (viii) a Noteholder, or (ix) a potential investor in the Notes. In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are Outstanding, the Securitisation Regulation Report will be available for inspection at the offices of, and copies thereof may be obtained free of charge upon request from, the Issuer.",p,
"Following the occurrence of the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator, the form, timing, frequency of distribution, method of distribution and content of the reporting related to the requirements of the Transparency RTS. The Collateral Administrator shall then consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees to provide such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to compile such report or the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager) elects not to appoint the Collateral Administrator to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall appoint another service provider in this regard.",p,

TAX CONSIDERATIONS,h3,
1. GENERAL,p,
Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.,p,
"POTENTIAL PURCHASERS ARE WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THEIR OWN TAX POSITION IN RESPECT OF THE NOTES. POTENTIAL PURCHASERS WHO ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THEIR TAX POSITION ON PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER OR EXERCISE OF ANY NOTE SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS. IN PARTICULAR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES WOULD BE CHARACTERISED BY ANY RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY. POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE RELEVANT FISCAL RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION MAY CHANGE, POSSIBLY WITH RETROSPECTIVE EFFECT, AND THAT THIS SUMMARY IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE. THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE OR A GUARANTEE TO ANY POTENTIAL INVESTOR OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTING IN THE NOTES.",p,
2. IRISH TAXATION Withholding Tax,h3,
"In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.), is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest which may include interest payable on the Notes (Section 246 of the TCA). However, an exemption from withholding on interest payments exists under Section 64 of the TCA for certain securities (“quoted Eurobonds”) issued by a body corporate (such as the Issuer) which are interest bearing and quoted on a recognised stock exchange which is not defined but is understood to mean an exchange recognised in the jurisdiction in which it is established, which would include Euronext Dublin.",p,
Any interest paid on such quoted Eurobonds can be paid free of withholding tax provided: the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or,p,
"the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and either:",p,
"(i) the quoted Eurobond is held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (Euroclear and Clearstream Luxembourg, amongst others, are so recognised), or",p,
"(ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as an Irish paying agent, if any) in the prescribed form.",p,
"So long as the Notes are quoted on a recognised stock exchange and either (a) or (b) above is met, interest may be paid on the Notes without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax.",p,
"If, for any reason, the quoted Eurobond exemption referred to above ceases to apply, the Issuer can still pay interest on the Notes free of withholding tax provided it is a “qualifying company” (within the meaning of Section 110) and provided the interest is paid to a person resident in a “relevant territory” (i.e. a Member State (other than Ireland) or in a country with which Ireland has signed a double taxation agreement). For this purpose, residence is determined by reference to the law of the country in which the recipient claims to be resident. This exemption from withholding tax will not apply, however, if the interest is paid to a company in connection with a trade or business carried on by it through a branch or agency located in Ireland.",p,
Encashment Tax,h3,
"Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not",p,
resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.,p,
Taxation of Noteholders,h3,
"In general, persons who are resident in Ireland are liable to Irish taxation on their world-wide income whereas persons who are not resident in Ireland are only liable to Irish taxation on their Irish source income. All persons are under a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.",p,
"Interest paid and discounts realised on the Notes have an Irish source and therefore interest earned and discounts realised on such Notes will be regarded as Irish source income. Accordingly, pursuant to general Irish tax rules, a non-Irish resident person in receipt of such income would be technically liable to Irish income tax (and the universal social charge if received by an individual) subject to the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty.",p,
"Ireland has currently 74 double tax treaties 73 of which are in effect and the majority of them exempt interest (which sometimes includes discounts) from Irish tax when received by a resident of the other jurisdiction. Credit is available for any Irish tax withheld from income on account of the related income tax liability. Non-Irish resident companies, where the income is not attributable to a branch or agency of the company in Ireland, are subject to income tax at the standard rate. Therefore any withholding tax suffered should be equal to and in satisfaction of the full income tax liability. (Non-Irish resident companies operating in Ireland through a branch or agency of the company in Ireland to which the income is attributable would be subject to Irish corporation tax).",p,
There is an exemption from Irish income tax under Section 198 of the TCA in certain circumstances. These circumstances include:,p,
where the interest is paid by a company in the ordinary course of business carried on by it to a company,p,
"(i) which, by virtue of the law of a relevant territory, is resident in the relevant territory for the purposes of tax, and that relevant territory imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside that territory, or (ii) where the interest is either (A) exempted from the charge to income tax under arrangements made with the government of a territory outside Ireland having the force of law under procedures set out in section 826(1) of the TCA, or (B) would be exempted from the charge to income tax if arrangements made, on or before the date of payment of the interest with the government of a territory outside Ireland that do not have force of law under procedures set out in Section 826(1) of the TCA, had the force of law when the interest was paid;",p,
where the interest is paid by a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA out of the assets of that qualifying company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory);,p,
"where the interest is payable on a quoted Eurobond (see “Withholding Tax” above) and is paid by a company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory) or to a company controlled, either directly or indirectly by a person or persons who are resident in a relevant territory and are not controlled, either directly or indirectly by persons who are not so resident; or",p,
"where discounts arise to a person in respect of securities issued by a company in the ordinary course of a trade or business, where that person is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory).",p,
"Interest on the Notes and discounts realised which do not fall within the exemptions in Section 198 of the TCA are within the charge to Irish income tax to the extent that a double tax treaty does not exempt the interest or discount as the case may be. However, it is understood that the Irish Revenue Commissioners have, in the past, operated a practice (as a consequence of the absence of a collection mechanism rather than adopted policy) whereby no action will be taken to pursue any liability to such Irish tax in respect of persons who are regarded as not being resident in Ireland except where such persons:",p,
are chargeable in the name of a person (including a trustee) or in the name of an agent or branch in Ireland having the management or control of the interest; or,p,
seek to claim relief and/or repayment of tax deducted at source in respect of taxed income from Irish sources; or,p,
are chargeable to Irish corporation tax on the income of an Irish branch or agency or to income tax on the profits of a trade carried on in Ireland to which the interest is attributable.,p,
"There can be no assurance that the Irish Revenue Commissioners will apply this practice in the case of the holders of Notes and, as mentioned above, there is a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self- assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.",p,
Qualifying Companies Holding Irish Specified Mortgages,h3,
"As a result of changes to Section 110 of the TCA introduced in Finance Act 2016 a restriction on the deductibility of interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return on the principal outstanding or is dependent on the results of the business of the “qualifying company” can apply from 6 September 2016 to the extent that the “qualifying company” holds and/or manages one or more “specified mortgages” (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA), being, inter alia, a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land.",p,
"The Finance Act 2017 extended the interest restriction introduced in the Finance Act 2016 to profit participating or excessive interest payable on or after 19 October 2017 by a “qualifying company” which holds and/or manages shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from Irish land. Shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value from, directly or indirectly, land in Ireland are to be included in the definition of “specified property business” (as defined in Section 110(5A)) to which the interest restriction can apply.",p,
"However, this restriction does not apply to the calculation of the profits arising to a “qualifying company” from, inter alia, a “CLO transaction” (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA) or activities which are preparatory thereto. A “CLO transaction” for these purposes means a securitisation transaction entered into by a “qualifying company” which is carried out in conformity with:",p,
"a prospectus, within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended);",p,
"listing particulars, where any securities issued by the “qualifying company” are listed on an exchange, other than the main exchange, of Ireland, or of a Member State of the European Union or the EEA (other than Ireland); or",p,
"where the securities issued by the “qualifying company” will not be listed on such an exchange, legally binding documents, that:",p,
(i) may provide for a warehousing period being a period not exceeding 3 years during which time the “qualifying company” is preparing to issue securities; and,p,
"(ii) provide for investment eligibility criteria that govern the type and quality of assets to be acquired,",p,
"and where, based on the documents referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) and the activities of the “qualifying company”, it would not be reasonable to consider that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the “qualifying company” was to acquire “specified mortgages”.",p,
"As such, if:",p,
the Issuer does not hold and/or manage “specified mortgages”; or,p,
"the activities of the Issuer comprise entering into a “CLO transaction” and/or activities which are preparatory thereto,",p,
this restriction should not apply to the calculation of the profits of the Issuer for Irish tax purposes.,p,
Capital Gains Tax,h3,
Persons who are resident in Ireland or companies which carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable and who realize a gain on the disposal of a Note may be liable to Irish taxation on capital gains at a rate of 33 per cent. of the amount of the chargeable capital gain. Individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and companies that are not resident in Ireland and do not carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of Notes.,p,
Capital Acquisitions Tax,h3,
"A gift or inheritance comprising Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland. Bearer notes are generally regarded as situated where they are physically located at any particular time. Registered notes are generally regarded as situated where the principal register of noteholders is maintained or required to be maintained, but the Notes may be regarded as situated in Ireland regardless of their physical location or the location of the register as they secure a debt due by an Irish resident debtor and they may be secured over Irish property. Accordingly, if such Notes are comprised in a gift or inheritance, the gift or inheritance may be within the charge to tax regardless of the residence status of the disponer or the donee/successor.",p,
Stamp Duty,h3,
"For so long as the Issuer is a “qualifying company” within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA, Irish stamp duty will not be imposed on the issue or transfer of the Notes provided the money raised by the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer’s business.",p,
The Common Reporting Standard in Ireland,h3,
"On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”). The CRS provides that certain entities (known as Financial Institutions) shall identify “Accounts” (as defined, broadly equity and debt interests in the Financial Institution) held by persons who are tax resident in other CRS participating jurisdictions. That information is then subject to annual automatic exchange between governments in CRS participating jurisdictions.",p,
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis. Ireland provided for the implementation of CRS through Section 891F of the TCA and the enactment of the Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 (the “CRS Regulations”). Irish Financial Institutions are obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II.,p,
"The Issuer is expected to constitute a Financial Institution for CRS purposes. In order to comply with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, the Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide certain information in respect of the Noteholders and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence. Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding of the Notes, to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will then exchange the information with the tax or governmental authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. To the extent that the Notes are held within a recognised clearing system, the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year.",p,
"Provided the Issuer complies with these obligations, it should be deemed compliant for CRS and DAC II purposes. Failure by the Issuer to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in it being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed pursuant to the Irish implementing legislation.",p,
FATCA Implementation in Ireland,h3,
"On 21 December 2012, the Governments of Ireland and the United States signed the Ireland IGA. In July 2014, Ireland enacted Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 (the “Irish FATCA Regulations”).",p,
The Ireland IGA and Irish FATCA Regulations increased the amount of tax information automatically exchanged between Ireland and the United States. They provide for the automatic reporting and exchange of information in relation to accounts held in Irish “financial institutions” by U.S. persons and the reciprocal exchange of information regarding U.S. financial accounts held by Irish residents.,p,
"The Issuer intends to carry on its business in such a way as to ensure that it is treated as complying with FATCA pursuant to the terms of the Ireland IGA and the Irish FATCA Regulations. The Issuer expects to be treated as a “financial institution”. The Issuer is required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service as a “reporting financial institution” for FATCA purposes. In order for the Issuer to comply with its FATCA obligations it is required to report certain information to the Irish Revenue Commissioners relating to Noteholders who, for FATCA purposes, are specified US persons, non-participating financial institutions or passive non-financial foreign entities that are controlled by specified US persons. Any information reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners will be communicated to the US Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the IGA. It is possible that the Irish Revenue Commissioners may also communicate this information to other tax authorities pursuant to the terms of any applicable double tax treaty, intergovernmental agreement or exchange of information regime.",p,
"The Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their FATCA status, identity or residency required by the Issuer to satisfy its FATCA obligations. Noteholders will be deemed, by their subscription for or holding of the Notes to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer or any other authorised person to the relevant tax authorities.",p,
"The Issuer should not generally be subject to FATCA withholding tax in respect of its US source income for so long as it complies with its FATCA obligations. However, FATCA withholding tax may arise on US source payments to the Issuer if the Issuer does not comply with its FATCA registration and reporting obligations and the US Internal Revenue Service has specifically identified the Issuer as being a ‘non-participating financial institution’ for FATCA purposes. In addition, the Issuer may be unable to comply with its FATCA obligations if Noteholders do not provide the required certifications or information. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential implication of the reporting requirements imposed on the Issuer by FATCA before investing.",p,
3. CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS General,h3,
"The following discussion summarises certain of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of the Notes.",p,
"For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Noteholder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:",p,
"? an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States, for U.S. federal income tax purposes;",p,
"? a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;",p,
? an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or,p,
"? a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions.",p,
"For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Noteholder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:",p,
? a non-resident alien individual for U.S. federal income tax purposes;,p,
? a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;,p,
? an estate whose income is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis; or,p,
? a trust if no court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration or if no United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions.,p,
"In the case of a partnership (or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a beneficial owner of a Note, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership (or other equity holder of such other pass- through entity) will generally depend on the status of such partner (or other equity holder) and upon the activities of such pass-through entity. Partners of partnerships (or other equity holders of other pass-through entities, as applicable) that are beneficial owners of Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.",p,
"An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year). This summary does not address tax considerations that may apply to such individuals.",p,
"This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors)) for cash and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to particular investors (such as any alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax consequences) or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; regulated investment companies; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Noteholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes. Finally, this summary does not address the tax consequences to a Reinvesting Noteholder as described in Condition 7(k) (Reinvesting Noteholders). Finally, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to certain non- corporate U.S. Noteholders that may be eligible for certain beneficial tax treatment under Section 199A of the Code.",p,

U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer,h3,
Generally: The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.,p,
"The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. In this regard, the Issuer intends to comply with the Trust Deed, including certain investment guidelines referenced therein (the “U.S. Tax Guidelines”) to reduce the risk that it may be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the U.S. Tax Guidelines may not give rise to an Event of Default under the Transaction Documents and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated",p,
"as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective Noteholders should be aware that no opinion of counsel will be delivered in connection with the question of whether the Issuer is treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for",p,
"U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"If it were determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer would be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, possibly on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to",p,
U.S. federal income tax on its net income.,p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes,h3,
"Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion from White & Case LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be received with respect to the Class F Notes. Such opinion will assume compliance with the transaction documents and the validity of certain assumptions and representations regarding the Notes. The Issuer intends to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that one or more Classes of Rated Notes are equity in the Issuer particularly the more junior Classes of Notes. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules applicable to U.S. equity owners in PFICs and/or CFCs, except that such Noteholders may be required to accrue any discount on such recharacterised Rated Notes under principles similar to those for original issue discount. See “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes – Possible Treatment of Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes” below. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.",p,
"The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees or will be deemed to agree to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.",p,
"The Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that materially adversely affects the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes as described herein, including by affecting the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Notes as indebtedness or equity or changing the characterisation and timing of income inclusions to U.S. Noteholders in respect of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion and the tax opinion of White & Case LLP assume that the Trust Deed is not so amended.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes,h3,
"Class X Notes, Class A Notes and Class B Notes.",p,
"Stated Interest. U.S. Noteholders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes will include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest accrued or received on their Notes, in accordance with their",p,

"An “Excess Distribution” is the amount by which the U.S. dollar value of distributions during a taxable year in respect of a Note exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions in respect thereof during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the U.S. Noteholder’s holding period for the Note).",p,
"In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made.

"Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Issuer will be a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the equity interests in the Issuer, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by 10 per cent. United States shareholders. For this purpose, a “10 per cent. United States shareholder” is any United States person that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or combined value of all classes of equity in the Issuer.

United States shareholder. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), determined with respect to aggregate value or aggregate outstanding principal amount, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such 10 per cent. United States shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. If, for any given taxable year, the Issuer is treated as a CFC for any period, a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer will be required to include as ordinary income an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of that person’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s “subpart F income” at the end of such taxable year. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income. Due to the application of certain constructive ownership rules (among other factors), it is possible that the Issuer may not have access to sufficient information to determine whether it is a CFC for any taxable year.",p,
"If the Issuer is treated as a CFC for any period during the taxable year and a U.S. Noteholder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Noteholder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Noteholder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the “qualified portion” of the U.S. Noteholder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Noteholder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Noteholder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Noteholder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Noteholder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified",p,

In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Noteholder that is a 10 per cent.

"Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs. If the Issuer owns a Collateral Obligation that is treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Noteholders of Subordinated Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Noteholder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Noteholder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Noteholders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC, and thus there can be no assurance that a U.S. Noteholder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.",p,
"Accordingly, if the U.S. Noteholder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the",p,
"U.S. Noteholder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Noteholder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Noteholder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Noteholder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Noteholder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Noteholder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Noteholder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were owned directly (as described above), and the",p,
"U.S. Noteholder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Noteholders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.",p,
"If a Collateral Obligation is treated as an indirect equity interest in a CFC and a U.S. Noteholder owns directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the CFC’s voting power or the value of its equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Noteholder generally will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” as ordinary income at the end of each taxable year, as described above under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation,” regardless of whether the CFC distributed any amounts to the Issuer during such taxable year or whether the U.S. Noteholder made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held CFC. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Noteholder on the sale by the Issuer of the CFC, and the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Noteholder on the sale by the U.S. Noteholder of its Subordinated Notes (as described below), generally will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Noteholder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, reduced by any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules. U.S. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax issues associated with such investments in light of their own individual circumstances.",p,
"Phantom Income. U.S. Noteholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the amounts that exceed the distributions they receive on the Subordinated Notes. For example, if the Issuer is a CFC and a U.S. Noteholder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, or a U.S. Noteholder makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the U.S. Noteholder will be subject to federal income tax with respect to its share of the Issuer’s income and gain (to the extent of the Issuer’s “earnings and profits”), which may exceed the Issuer’s distributions. It is expected that the Issuer’s income and gain (and earnings and profits) will exceed cash distributions with respect to (i) debt instruments that were issued with OID and are held by the Issuer, and",p,
(ii) the acquisition at a discount of the Issuer’s Rated Notes by the Issuer (including by reason of a Refinancing or any deemed exchange that occurs for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a modification of the Trust Deed). U.S. Noteholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the timing of income and gain on the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"Distributions. The treatment of actual distributions on the Subordinated Notes, in very general terms, will vary depending on whether a U.S. Noteholder has made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer (as described above). See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company.” If a timely QEF election has been made, distributions should be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) and to this extent will not be taxable to U.S. Noteholders. Distributions in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of the U.S. Noteholder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes (as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”), and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, a U.S. Noteholder will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the distribution on the date received and the U.S. dollar value of the previously taxed amount. Any exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss.",p,

Distributions that do not constitute Excess Distributions and are in excess of untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of a U.S. Noteholder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes, and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge, as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”.",p,

The U.S. Noteholder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Noteholder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a non-taxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.",p,
"If the U.S. Noteholder has made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, then, except to the extent that the Issuer is treated as a CFC and the U.S. Noteholder is treated as a 10 per cent.

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of any Notes it may purchase.",p,

"If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their exposure to liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).",p,
"The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for the purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C",p,
"Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes and the Class F Notes may and the Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation.",p,
"Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes and any interests in such Notes. In reliance on representations made and deemed to be made by investors in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes and interests therein held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note or an interest in any such Note will be required to make or be deemed to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed).",p,
"Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note (or interest therein) held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.",p,
"Even if the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes , the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes were not treated as equity interests in the Issuer for the purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84 14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in house asset managers) and Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain persons who provide services to plans or are related to plan service providers). Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving any Notes. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.",p,
"Each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).",p,

The first financial statements of the Issuer will be in respect of the period from incorporation to 31 December 2020. The annual accounts of the Issuer will be audited.

the constitution of the Issuer;,p,
the Trust Deed (which includes the form of each Note of each Class); the Agency Agreement;,p,
the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement; the Corporate Services Agreement;,p,
each Monthly Report;,p,
each Payment Date Report;,p,
(h) each Securitisation Regulation Report; and the Risk Retention Letter.,p,
Post Issuance Reporting,h3,
The Issuer will provide post-issuance transaction information in relation to the issue of Notes.,p,
Enforceability of Judgments,h3,
"The Issuer is a designated activity company incorporated under the laws of Ireland. None of the Directors and officers of the Issuer are residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United States courts judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States.",p,
"As the United States is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the United States courts is enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the United States courts will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are met:",p,
(a) the United States courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and,p,
"(b) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where, however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.",p,
"However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the United States courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:",p,
(i) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;,p,
(ii) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;,p,
(iii) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice;,p,
(iv) the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain United States laws which will not be enforced in Ireland;,p,
(v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules; or,p,
(vi) there is no practical benefit to the party in whose favour the foreign judgment is made in seeking to have that judgment enforced in Ireland.,p,

"The purpose of this ERISA Certificate (this “Certificate”) is, among other things, to (i) endeavour to ensure that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) issued by Accunia European CLO IV Designated Activity Company. (the “Issuer”) is held by (a) an employee benefit plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (b) a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or (c) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity (collectively, “Benefit Plan Investors”), (ii) obtain from you certain representations and agreements and (iii) provide you with certain related information with respect to your acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes. By signing this Certificate, you agree to be bound by its terms.",p,
"Please be aware that the information contained in this Certificate is not intended to constitute advice and the examples given below are not intended to be, and are not, comprehensive. You should contact your own counsel if you have any questions in completing this Certificate. Capitalised terms not defined in this Certificate shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Trust Deed.",p,
"By checking a box, you are representing and warranting as to your status for so long as you hold a Note or interest therein. If a box is not checked, you are representing and agreeing that the applicable Section does not, and will not, apply to you.",p,
"1. Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA or the Code. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code.",p,
"Examples: (i) tax qualified retirement plans such as pension, profit sharing and section 401(k) plans, (ii) welfare benefit plans such as accident, life and medical plans, (iii) individual retirement accounts or “IRAs” and “Keogh” plans and (iv) certain tax-qualified educational and savings trusts.",p,
"2. Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in such entity.",p,
"Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and",p,
(iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the total value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.,p,
"If you check Box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code:",p,
per cent.,p,
"AN ENTITY OR FUND THAT CANNOT PROVIDE THE FOREGOING PERCENTAGE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS OWN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT. OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE CLASS E NOTES, CLASS F NOTES OR SUBORDINATED NOTES (DETERMINED SEPARATELY BY CLASS), 100 PER CENT. OF THE ASSETS OF THE ENTITY OR FUND WILL BE TREATED AS “PLAN ASSETS.”",p,
"ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section 2, you should consult with your counsel.",p,
"3. Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or interest therein with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company’s",p,
"corporate investment portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”).",p,
"If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent. test under the Plan Asset Regulations: per cent.

"4. None of Sections (1) Through (3) Above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections (1) through",p,
"(3) above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer and the Trustee of such change, however, we understand and agree that any such notice will not cause the representation made in the previous sentence to be ineffective, to the extent that the 25 per cent. limitation described in the first paragraph of this certificate is exceeded.",p,
"5. No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) through (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or any interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.",p,
"6. Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or interests therein will not constitute or result in a violation of any law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.",p,
"7. Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Trustee, (ii) the Collateral Manager, (iii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iv) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (v) any “affiliate” of any of the above persons. “Affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a “Controlling Person”.",p,
"Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes, the Notes held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.",p,
8. Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:,p,
"(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer may, promptly after such discovery (or upon notice from the Trustee if the Trustee makes the discovery (who, in each case, agree to notify the Issuer of such discovery, if any)), send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder within 10 days after the date of such notice;",p,
"(ii) if we fail to transfer our Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or interests therein, the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or our interest in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated",p,
Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;,p,
"(iii) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes and selling such securities to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;",p,

(i) for the period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, 18 December 2020, by reference to a straight line interpolation of 6 month EURIBOR and 12 month EURIBOR and (ii) for the period from and including the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date, to but excluding the Maturity Date if such final Payment Date falls in September 2032, by reference to three month EURIBOR. EURIBOR applicable to the Floating Rate Notes shall be subject to a floor of zero per cent. per annum.

4 The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by KBRA address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by KBRA address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by any Rating Agency. As of the date of this Offering Circular, Moody’s Investors Service, Ltd (“Moody’s”) is established in the United Kingdom (“UK” ) and each of S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (“S&P”) and Kroll Bond Rating Agency Europe Limited (“KBRA”) is established in the European Union (“EU”) and each such Rating Agency is registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (as amended) (“CRA 3”). As such, each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance with CRA 3.

The assets securing the Notes will consist of a portfolio predominantly comprised of Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations, High Yield Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, PIK Obligations and Senior Unsecured Obligations managed by CVC Credit Partners European CLO Management LLP (the “Collateral Manager”).
CVC Cordatus Loan Fund XVII DAC (the “Issuer”) will issue the Rated Notes and the Subordinated Notes (each as defined herein).
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (such Classes of Notes, the “Rated Notes”) together with the Subordinated Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Notes”. The Notes will be issued and secured pursuant to a trust deed (the “Trust Deed”) dated on or about 16 June 2020 (the “Issue Date”), made between (amongst others) the Issuer and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, in its capacity as trustee (the “Trustee”).
The Issuer expects to be a “covered fund” for the purposes of the Volcker Rule. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Volcker Rule”.
Interest on the Notes will be payable (a) quarterly in arrear on 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 18 December prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event (as defined herein) and semi-annually in arrear on 18 March and 18 September (where the Payment Date (as defined herein) immediately prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event falls in either March
or September) or 18 June and 18 December (where the Payment Date immediately prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event falls in either June or December) following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event (or, in each case, if such day is not a Business Day (as defined herein), then on the next succeeding Business Day (unless it would fall in the following month, in which case it shall be moved to the immediately preceding Business Day)) in each year, commencing on 18 December 2020 and ending on the Maturity Date (as defined below) and (b) on any Redemption Date, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payments described herein.
The Notes will be subject to Optional Redemption and Mandatory Redemption and Special Redemption, each as described herein. See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).
See the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein for a discussion of certain factors to be considered in connection with an investment in the Notes.
This offering circular (the “Offering Circular”) does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as may be amended or superseded from time to time, the “Prospectus Regulation”). The Issuer is not offering the Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances that would require a prospectus to be prepared pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Application has been made to The Irish Stock Exchange plc trading as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”) for the Notes to be admitted to the official list (the “Official List”) and to trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin (the “Global Exchange Market”). The Global Exchange Market is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”). There can be no assurance that any such listing will be maintained. Euronext Dublin has approved this document as listing particulars.
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer which are payable solely out of amounts received by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Collateral (as defined herein). The net proceeds of the realisation of the security over the Collateral upon acceleration of the Notes following a Note Event of Default (as defined herein) may be insufficient to pay all amounts due to the Noteholders (as defined herein) after making payments to other creditors of the Issuer ranking prior thereto or pari passu therewith. In the event of a shortfall in such proceeds, the Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets (including the Issuer Profit Account and the rights of the Issuer under the Corporate Services Agreement (each as defined herein)) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall, all claims in respect of which shall be extinguished. See Condition 4 (Security).
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and will be offered only: (a) outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”)); and (b) within the United States to persons and outside the United States to U.S. Persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S (“U.S. Persons”)), in each case, who are both qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A and qualified purchasers for the purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Neither the Issuer nor the Collateral Manager will be registered under the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and each purchaser of Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has issued a ruling invalidating the application of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules in certain CLO transactions. Each prospective investor should note that no party involved in the transaction will obtain on the Issue Date and retain any Notes intended to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See “Risk Factors— Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements―U.S. Risk Retention Rules”.
The Notes will be issued at a maximum issue price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. The Notes (other than the Retention Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes purchased by the Retention Holder and CVC Credit Partners Global CLO Management Limited, respectively) are being offered by the Issuer through NATIXIS, in its capacity as initial purchaser of the offering of such Notes (the “Initial Purchaser”) subject to prior sale, when, as and if delivered to and accepted by the Initial Purchaser, and to certain conditions. The Retention Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes shall be purchased directly from the Issuer on the Issue Date by the Retention Holder and CVC Credit Partners Global CLO Management Limited respectively pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement. Each of the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be privately negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and which may be different to the issue price of the Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made on or about the Issue Date. It is a Condition of the Notes that all of the Notes are issued concurrently.

EU RETENTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the Collateral Manager, in its capacity as the Retention Holder, will undertake to the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and the Trustee to acquire and hold the Retention Notes on the terms set out in the EU Retention Letter. See further “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements”.
Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any similar requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisers or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisers and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—Securitisation Regulation” below for further information.
The Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will include a statement as to the receipt by the Collateral Administrator of a confirmation from the Retention Holder as to the holding of the Retention Notes, which confirmation the Retention Holder will undertake in the EU Retention Letter, to provide to the Collateral Administrator on a monthly basis.
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will, at the expense of the Issuer, undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Collateral Manager, reasonably required and in its possession and/or control in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the assistance of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and
(e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”) and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and other information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available via (A) a website (or procure that such information is made available) currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Hedge Counterparties and as further notified by the Issuer to the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies to the Collateral Administrator (such certification to be in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager from time to time, such certificate may be given electronically and upon which certification the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is: (i) the Issuer, (ii) the Arranger, (iii) the Initial Purchaser, (iv) the Trustee, (v) a Hedge Counterparty, (vi) the Collateral Manager, (vii) the Retention Holder,
(viii) the Liquidity Facility Provider, (ix) a Rating Agency, (x) a Noteholder, (xi) a potential investor in the Notes,
(xii) a Competent Authority, (xiii) Intex or (xiv) Bloomberg and/or (B) such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation or a Competent Authority (as instructed by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator). If the Collateral Administrator does not
agree to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager (or the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager) elects not to appoint the Collateral Administrator) in providing such reporting, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager shall appoint another entity to make such information available to any Competent Authority, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, neither the Collateral Administrator nor the Collateral Manager will assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager also assume no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
The Issuer intends that this Offering Circular constitutes a transaction summary overview of the main features of the transaction contemplated herein for the purposes of Article 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation.
U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) require the “sponsor” of a “securitization transaction” to retain (either directly or through its “majority-owned affiliates”) an economic interest in not less than 5 per cent. of the “credit risk” of “securitized assets” (as such terms are defined in the U.S. Retention Requirements). In the LSTA Decision (as defined herein), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that regulators lacked Congressional authority to designate the collateral manager of an open market CLO as the “sponsor” of such CLO. Each prospective investor should note that no party involved in the transaction will obtain on the Issue Date and retain any Notes intended to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements– U.S. Risk Retention Rules”.
Notwithstanding the above, the Retention Holder will on the Issue Date purchase the Retention Notes, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements.
VOLCKER RULE
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the “Volcker Rule”) relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to in the Volcker Rule as covered funds, except as may be permitted by an applicable exclusion or exception from the Volcker Rule. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds. Subject to certain exceptions and extensions, full conformance with the Volcker Rule was required from 21 July 2015. In general, there is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule.
Key terms are defined under the Volcker Rule, including “banking entity”, “ownership interest”, “sponsor” and “covered fund”. In particular, “banking entity” is defined to include certain non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking entities as well as non-U.S. banking entities that conduct operations in the United States either directly or through branches or affiliates, “covered fund” is defined to include an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereof, subject to certain exemptions and exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations (which would extend to the Issuer given its intention to rely on section 3(c)(7)) and “ownership interest” is defined to include, among other things, interests arising through a holder’s exposure to profits and losses in the covered fund or through any right of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of, among others, an investment manager or advisor, general partner or the board of directors of such covered fund. It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose. It is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. Providing that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a successor collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default may not be sufficient to ensure that the Rated Notes are not characterised as ownership interests. If the Issuer is deemed to be a covered fund then in the absence of regulatory relief such prohibitions may have adverse effects on the Issuer and the liquidity and value of the Notes including limiting the secondary market of the Notes and affecting the Issuer’s access to liquidity and ability to hedge its exposures.
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and Class D Notes are issued in subclasses, some of which have voting rights with respect to the removal and replacement of the Collateral Manager and others of which do not possess those rights. Accordingly, U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities investing in those classes of Notes will have the option to invest in subclasses that do not by their terms have a right to remove or replace the Collateral Manager. There can be no assurance, however, that owning the Notes of a subclass which by their terms do not have a right to remove or replace the Collateral Manager, will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule (whether in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or otherwise) not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.
Each investor is responsible for analysing its own position under the Volcker Rule and any similar measures and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation regarding such position, including with respect to the ability of any investor to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future. See “Risk Factors— Regulatory Initiatives—Volcker Rule” below.
Information as to placement within the United States
The Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the Securities Act (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (including, where applicable, the CM Voting Notes, the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and the CM Non-Voting Notes of such Class) (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”) or in some cases (including, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes) definitive certificates (each a “Rule 144A Definitive Certificate” and together the “Rule 144A Definitive Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”) or in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Notes of each Class (including, where applicable, the CM Voting Notes, the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and the CM Non-Voting Notes of such Class) sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes”) (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”), or in some cases (including, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes) by definitive certificates of such Class (each a “Regulation S Definitive Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Definitive Certificates”) in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof.

PRIIPs Regulation and Prospectus Regulation
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.
MIFID II Product Governance
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.
APPLICABILITY OF EU LAW IN THE UK
THE UK WITHDREW FROM AND CEASED TO BE A MEMBER STATE OF THE EU AT 11:00 P.M. GMT ON 31 JANUARY 2020. THE NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE UK AND THE EU PROVIDES FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD, COMMENCING ON 31 JANUARY 2020 AND ENDING AT 11.00 P.M. GMT ON 31 DECEMBER 2020, UNLESS EXTENDED BY A SINGLE DECISION FOR UP TO ONE OR TWO YEARS (SUCH PERIOD, THE “TRANSITION PERIOD”)) OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT, EU LAW WILL BE APPLICABLE TO AND IN THE UK DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD ANY REFERENCES IN THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR TO THE “EU” AND ITS “MEMBER STATES” IN THE CONTEXT OF EU LEGISLATION AND THE APPLICATION THEREOF SHALL BE INTERPRETED SO AS TO INCLUDE THE UK (EXCEPT WHERE EXPRESSLY INDICATED OTHERWISE).

Security for the Notes
General The Notes will be secured in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of
the Secured Parties by security over a portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations predominantly consisting of Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds. The Notes will also be secured by an assignment by way of security of various of the Issuer’s other rights, including its rights under certain of the agreements described herein. See Condition 4 (Security).
Hedging ArrangementsThe Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) will not
be permitted to enter into a Hedge Agreement to hedge interest rate risk and/or currency risk unless either (i) such Hedge Agreement complies with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria, or (ii) the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) obtains legal advice from reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to be required to register with the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor pursuant to the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”) with respect to the Issuer. Notwithstanding the above, if, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Manager, entry into a Hedge Agreement would require such registration with respect to, and at the expense of, the Issuer, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) will not be permitted to enter into such Hedge Agreement unless such registration is made by the Collateral Manager. The Issuer will also be obliged to obtain Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless it is in a form in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has previously received written approval from each Rating Agency. See “Hedging Arrangements”.
On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) may enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions which are interest rate caps (“Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions”) with one or more Interest Rate Hedge Counterparties in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in EURIBOR-based payments of interest payable by the Issuer on the Rated Notes. Should the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) enter into such transactions on the Issue Date, the Issuer will pay a premium to such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty or Interest Rate Hedge Counterparties. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) would be required to exercise such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions if at any time EURIBOR was greater than the strike price set out in the applicable Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) will be permitted to novate for value any Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction on any date (a) upon which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in whole or (b) upon
receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation. See “Hedging Arrangements”.

Coverage Tests .......................................... The Coverage Tests will be used primarily to determine whether
principal and interest may be paid on the Rated Notes and distributions may be made on the Subordinated Notes or whether funds which would otherwise be used to pay interest on the Rated Notes and to make distributions on the Subordinated Notes must instead be used to pay principal on one or more Classes of Rated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
Each of the Par Value Tests and Interest Coverage Tests shall be satisfied on a Determination Date in the case of (i) the Par Value Tests, on and after the Effective Date and (ii) the Interest Coverage Tests on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date; if the corresponding Par Value Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio (as the case may be) is at least equal to the percentage specified in the table below in relation to that Coverage Test:

Interest Diversion Test............................... On any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date and
during the Reinvestment Period only, if the Class E Par Value Ratio is less than 111.04 per cent. on the relevant Determination Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds in an amount (such amount, the “Required Diversion Amount”) equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (U) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of (A) through (T) inclusive of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Interest Diversion Test to be met as of the relevant Determination Date, such amounts to be applied during the Reinvestment Period (i) to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations, provided that such payment would not, in the determination of the Collateral Administrator (with such consultation with the Collateral Manager and the Retention Holder as the Collateral Administrator deems necessary), cause (or would not be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency or (ii) to payment of the Rated Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence.
Liquidity Facility For the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding)
the earliest of (a) the Business Day that is immediately preceding the date that is four years from the Issue Date, subject to renewal for one or two additional one year periods in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement; (b) the date on which the Liquidity Facility is cancelled in its entirety in accordance with its provisions; and (c) the date on which the Rated Notes are redeemed in full, or in each case, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately prior to such day (the “Liquidity Facility Commitment Period”), the Issuer will, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, be entitled on any proposed date of advance to make drawings under a liquidity facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) provided pursuant to a liquidity facility agreement (the “Liquidity Facility Agreement”) entered into on or before the Issue Date, between, inter alios, the Issuer (as borrower) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as liquidity facility provider) (the “Liquidity Facility Provider”).
The Issuer will be entitled to draw under the Liquidity Facility Agreement (each, a “Liquidity Drawing”) funds for the payments under, and in accordance with, the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments on any Payment Date (provided each applicable Coverage
Test senior to the relevant payment is satisfied on the relevant Determination Date, for such purposes assuming that such Liquidity Drawing has already been made) but in any event in an amount not exceeding the lesser of (i) the Available Commitment then available (taking into account any Liquidity Drawing scheduled to be repaid on the proposed date of drawdown) on the day such Liquidity Drawing is to be made and (ii) the Accrued Collateral Debt Obligation Interest in respect of the relevant Payment Date, subject to certain limitations as set out in “Description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement”.
Save as otherwise provided in the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer shall repay each Liquidity Drawing in full on or before the Payment Date following the applicable date of drawdown in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments. Each Subsequent Drawdown (as defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement) shall be applied in repayment (in whole or in part) of the related Initial Drawdown (as defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement) or, if applicable, any Subsequent Drawdown refinancing the same or refinancing any earlier Subsequent Drawdown.
The maximum amount of the Liquidity Facility shall be €1,500,000 until the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date (subject to reduction, amortisation or cancellation in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement).
Authorised DenominationsThe Regulation S Notes of each Class will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class will be issued in minimum denominations of €250,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

‎Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may at any time only be held through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.
The Rule 144A Global Certificates will bear a legend and such Rule 144A Global Certificates, or any interest therein, may not be transferred except in compliance with the transfer restrictions set out in such legend. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
No beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery thereof through a Regulation S Global Certificate unless the transferor provides the Issuer with a written certification substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed regarding compliance with certain of such transfer restrictions. Any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate to a person who takes delivery through an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate is also subject to certification requirements substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed and each purchaser thereof shall be deemed to represent that such purchaser is a QP. In addition, interests in any of the Regulation S Notes may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident. See “Form of the Notes” and “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”.
Non-Voting NotesThe Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the
Class D Notes may be in the form of a CM Voting Note, a CM Non- Voting Exchangeable Note or a CM Non-Voting Note.
CM Voting Notes shall carry a right to vote in respect of, and be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Replacement Resolution and any CM Removal Resolution. CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and CM Non- Voting Notes shall not carry any rights in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution but shall carry a right to vote on and be counted in respect of all other matters in respect of which the CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted.
CM Voting Notes shall be exchangeable at any time upon request by the relevant Noteholder into CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes. CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes shall be exchangeable (a) upon request by the relevant Noteholder at any time into CM Non-Voting Notes or (b) into CM Voting Notes only in connection with the transfer of such Notes to an entity that is not an Affiliate of the transferor upon request of the relevant transferee or transferor and in no other circumstance. CM Non- Voting Notes shall not be exchangeable at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of, voting on any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution (other than, in the case of Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person, a CM Replacement Resolution in respect of the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager which is not Affiliated to that
Collateral Manager and where the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager is not due to the Collateral Manager having been removed due to a Collateral Manager Event of Default in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Conditions).
Governing LawThe Notes, the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management Agreement,
the Agency Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Agreement and all other Transaction Documents will be governed by English law (other than the Corporate Services Agreement, which will be governed by Irish law).
Listing Application has been made to Euronext Dublin for the Notes to be
admitted to the Official List and to trading on its Global Exchange Market. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be maintained. Euronext Dublin has approved this document as listing particulars. See “General Information”.
Tax StatusSee “Tax Considerations”.
Certain ERISA ConsiderationsEach initial investor and each transferee that is purchasing a Class E
Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. If an initial investor or transferee is unable to make such deemed representation, such initial investor or transferee may not acquire such Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate unless such initial investor or transferee:
(i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer (other than in the case of the Notes purchased by the Retention Holder); (ii) provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate)) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and (iii) holds such Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate; provided that the Collateral Manager, Benefit Plan Investors and Controlling Person that purchase such Notes on the Issue Date may hold such Notes in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate (or as otherwise permitted in writing by the Issuer). Any Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate shall be registered in the name of the holder thereof. See “Certain ERISA Considerations”.
Withholding TaxNo gross up of any payments to the Noteholders is required of the
Issuer. See Condition 9 (Taxation).
Additional IssuancesSubject to certain conditions being met, additional Notes of:
(a) one or more existing Classes; and
(b) one or more new Classes, provided that such new Classes will be subordinated in right to the repayment of interest and principal of the Rated Notes in accordance with applicable Priorities of Payments,
may be issued and sold.
See Condition 17 (Additional Issuance).
Retention Holder and EU Retention
and Transparency RequirementsThe Collateral Manager (in its capacity as the Retention Holder) will
agree that for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding, it will hold Class M-1 Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount
Outstanding equal to not less than 5 per cent. of the greater of (i) the Aggregate Collateral Balance and (ii) the Target Par Amount pursuant to the EU Retention Letter, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements. See “Risk Factors— Regulatory Initiatives—Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—Securitisation Regulation” and “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements—The EU Retention”.
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will, at the expense of the Issuer, undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Collateral Manager, reasonably required and in its possession and/or control in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the assistance of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”) and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and other information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available via (A) a website (or procure that such information ismade available) currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Hedge Counterparties and as further notified by the Issuer to the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies to the Collateral Administrator (such certification to be in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager from time to time, such certificate may be given electronically and upon which certification the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is: (i) the Issuer, (ii) the Arranger,
(iii) the Initial Purchaser, (iv) the Trustee, (v) a Hedge Counterparty,
(vi) the Collateral Manager, (vii) the Retention Holder, (viii) the Liquidity Facility Provider, (ix) a Rating Agency, (x) a Noteholder,
(xi) a potential investor in the Notes, (xii) a Competent Authority,
(xiii) Intex or (xiv) Bloomberg and/or (B) such other method of
dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation or a Competent Authority (as instructed by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager (or the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager) elects not the appoint the Collateral Administrator) in providing such reporting, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager shall appoint another entity to make such information available to any Competent Authority, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.

1. GENERAL

1.1 General
It is intended that the Issuer will invest in loans, bonds and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payments. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payments). In particular, (i) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the other Classes of Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payments than those of the Subordinated Notes.
None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents nor the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular or the Reports, as the case may be.
In preparing and furnishing the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Debt Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager and third parties) (and reviewed by the Collateral Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.
In addition, the information contained in the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will be dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager. The accuracy of the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, and the information included therein, will therefore be subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager.
1.2 Suitability
Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer
The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payments. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s
Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets
Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.
As discussed further in “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.
Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.
Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.
The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business
conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non- performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Debt Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Debt Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.
The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.
While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.
There has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (COVID-19)) (“COVID-19”), that was first detected in December 2019 and which has now been found in over 200 countries globally. This outbreak and measures being put in place to restrict its spread have disrupted (and may continue to disrupt) economies and slowed (and may continue to slow) economic growth both in countries where the outbreak has been detected and in others. This may result, and in some cases (including in respect of the United Kingdom) has resulted, in the downgrade of certain sovereign credit ratings by certain rating agencies. This has (and may continue to) materially and adversely impact the global supply chain, market and economies. At this time, it remains uncertain whether the outbreak can be contained and what its impact will be in different affected areas, or how disruptive such outbreak and preventive measures may be to the global and regional economies. This state of affairs is causing (and may continue to cause) significant uncertainty in both domestic and global financial markets, has led to (and may continue to cause) volatility and disruption in the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on certain Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations. These additional risks and market disruptions may materially and adversely affect the ability of Obligors to make payments under Collateral Debt Obligations, the liquidity and value of the Notes, the ratings applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations (see “Ratings on Collateral Debt Obligations”), the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes and the Issuer’s ability to acquire and sell Collateral Debt Obligations.
In particular, rating actions (including, in respect of the potential downgrade of ratings applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations, such ratings being downgraded between the date of this Offering Circular and the Issue Date) may result in the Initial Ratings of any Class of Rated Notes published by the Rating Agencies being lower than is described in this Offering Circular. Furthermore, any such rating actions taken between the Issue Date and the Effective Date could result in (a) a downgrade of one of more Classes of Rated Notes from their Initial Ratings and (b) certain Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests not being satisfied as at the Effective Date, resulting in an Effective Date Rating Event and following which the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) (see also “Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period”). If any rating assigned to the Notes is subject
to a downgrade, the market value of the Notes may be adversely affected (see “Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope”).
1.6 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders
In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Debt Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Debt Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Debt Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk
Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.
As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.
Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.
Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.
1.8 The UK’s Withdrawal from the European Union
On 31 January 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU (as more particularly described below). At this time, the full consequences of such withdrawal are not clear.
In particular, there is uncertainty as to the final trade arrangements to be put in place following the expiry of the Transition Period (as defined below). Investors should be aware that the Issuer’s risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Debt Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.
Applicability of EU law in the UK

The negotiated withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU provides for a transition period, commencing on 31 January 2020 and ending at 11.00 p.m. GMT on 31 December 2020, unless extended by a single decision for up to one or two years (such period, the “Transition Period”). The UK government has stated that it will not seek such an extension. The negotiated withdrawal agreement states that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law will be applicable to and in the UK during the Transition Period. Accordingly, during the Transition Period any references in this Offering Circular to the “EU” and its “Member States” in the context of EU legislation and the application thereof shall be interpreted so as to include the UK (except where expressly indicated otherwise).
During the Transition Period negotiations will continue between the UK and the EU in respect of the nature of their future relationship. It is at present unclear what type of future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will be established. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so or when negotiations of such relationship will be finalised.
Following the end of the Transition Period, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the final trade arrangements to be put in place, substantial amendments to English law may occur and may diverge from the corresponding provisions of EU law applicable after the Transition Period. Consequently, English law may change and differ from EU law and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio, the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects or any potential investors. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Regulatory Risk

Under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EEA and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross- border basis in other EEA countries without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to how, following the expiry of the Transition Period, the existing passporting regime will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the EEA and the UK, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may, following the expiry of the Transition Period, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.
There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU will include arrangements for the continuation of the existing passporting regime or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Regulatory Risk – UK manager

At the end of the Transition Period, the UK will no longer be within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and if an alternative passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK is not in place, then a UK manager such as the Collateral Manager may be unable to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer in reliance upon the passporting of relevant regulated services within the EU on a cross-border basis provided for under MiFID II.
MiFID II, which has applied since 3 January 2018, provides (among other things) for the ability for non- EU investment firms to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In order to qualify to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis, non-EU investment firms will be required (i) to be authorised in a third country to provide collateral management services which are regulated under MiFID II (A) in respect of which the Commission has adopted an equivalency decision and (B) where the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has established cooperation arrangements with the relevant Competent Authorities, and (ii) to be registered with ESMA to do so. It is not possible to guarantee or predict the timing of any Commission equivalency decision, cooperation arrangements or registration by ESMA in relation to the UK.
However, MiFID II provides certain transitional measures so that third country investment firms may continue to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis in accordance with the relevant national regimes (i) until the time of any Commission equivalency decision and (ii) following any Commission equivalency decision, for a maximum of three years.
The European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 S.I. No. 375 of 2017 (the “2017 MiFID Regulations”) implemented Directive 2014/65/EU into Irish law, effective 3 January 2018. The 2017 MiFID Regulations contain a “safe-harbour” for non-EU investment firms providing relevant investment services to eligible counterparties and per se professional clients.
In summary, if the Collateral Manager has no head or registered office in the EU and no branch in Ireland, it would not generally need to be an authorised investment firm in order to provide collateral management services in Ireland to the Issuer, so long as:
(i) the Issuer is a professional client within the meaning of Part I of Annex II of MiFID II;
(ii) the Collateral Manager is subject to authorisation and supervision in the non-EU country where the Collateral Manager is established and the Collateral Manager is authorised so that the competent authority of the non-EU country pays due regard to any recommendations of Financial Action Task Force in the context of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism; and
(iii) co-operation arrangements that include provisions regulating the exchange of information for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the market and protecting investors are in place between the Central Bank and the competent authorities where the Collateral Manager is established.
On 14 July 2017, the Irish Department of Finance issued a feedback statement in advance of the publication of the Irish MiFID II Regulations. This statement provides guidance on the application of the above third country status conditions to the safe harbour, declaring that the safe harbour was not to apply in respect of non-EU firms whose home country is either on the Financial Action Task Force list of non- cooperative jurisdictions or who is not a signatory to the International Organisation of Securities Commissions Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding concerning consultation and cooperation and the exchange of information.
The UK does not fall within either of those categories, and therefore the Collateral Manager should be able to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer following the UK’s departure from the EU.
Market Risk

Following the result of the referendum on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and its subsequent withdrawal, the financial markets have experienced volatility and disruption. This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Debt Obligations.
Investors should be aware that as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, any negotiation between the UK and the EU with respect to their future trading relationship and following the expiry of the Transition Period, changes to legislation may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Exposure to Counterparties

The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the end of the Transition Period and depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information, see “Counterparty Risk” below.
Ratings actions

Since the results of the referendum on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU each of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and Moody’s also placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, Fitch have further downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.
The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, such downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.
While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see “Counterparty Risk” below.
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available
Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Debt Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets . The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator
and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be bought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.
This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.
None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee nor any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All investors whose investment activities are subject to: investment laws, rules and regulations (including risk retention laws, rules and regulations that apply currently to the investor, or which may do so in the future); regulatory capital requirements; or to review by regulatory authorities, should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes are subject to any such investment or other restrictions and to unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor's investment in the Notes).
2.1 Basel III and Basel IV
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the European Union.
In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the
introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50 per cent. of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5 per cent. of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027. No timeline has been established for adopting these changes by the U.S. banking regulatory agencies.
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
2.2 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements
Securitisation Regulation
Background

A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the CRR (as defined in the Conditions)](the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).
There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below. Most of the relevant technical standards have not yet been adopted.
Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal regulatory or other requirements. No such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.
Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors

The EU Retention and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment
funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the CRR, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).
These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified (among other things) that: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investor; (ii) the originator, sponsor or securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which see “EU Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation; and (iv) where the originator or original lender is established in a non- EU country, credit granting criteria apply that are substantially similar to those in (iii) .
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.
Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those Institutional Investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge in respect of the Notes acquired by the relevant investor.
Risk Retention Obligation

The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or of up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover (the “Pecuniary Sanctions”).
Any such Pecuniary Sanction levied on the Retention Holder may materially adversely affect the ability of the Retention Holder to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below.
Transparency Requirements

The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e. the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting requirements in Article 7 (the “EU Transparency Requirements”). The reporting entity must make certain prescribed information available to holders of a securitisation position, to the relevant competent authorities (“Competent Authorities”) and, upon request, to potential investors.
Under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing. It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form by way of a website (see https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee any Hedge Counterparty or any other person gives any assurance as to whether Competent Authorities will determine that such disclosure is sufficient for the purposes of the Securitisation Regulation.
Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) (“Inside Information”); and, where applicable, information on “significant events” (“Significant Events”).
The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not more than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.
On 16 October 2019 the Commission adopted certain technical standards under the EU Transparency Requirements containing detailed draft disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports, Investor Reports and, in relation to public transactions only, Inside Information and Significant Events (the “Transparency RTS”). The European Parliament and the Council have a prescribed period (which may be extended) following the Commission’s adoption during which they may object to the Transparency RTS. The application date of the Transparency RTS and the reporting requirements contained therein has not yet been specified. Further, there remains significant uncertainty as to the jurisdictional scope of the reporting requirements contained in the Transparency RTS.
The transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the EU Transparency Requirements provide that until the application of the Transparency RTS, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the “CRA3 RTS”). Currently, there is no dedicated CRA3 RTS template for CLO transactions (other than with respect to content of Investor Reports set out in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS), nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS.
On 30 November 2018, the European Banking Authority (the “EBA”), ESMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (the “European Supervisory Authorities” or “ESAs”) published a joint statement (the “Joint Statement”) regarding the reporting templates to be used for the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports (the “Article 7 Quarterly Reporting Requirements”) in the period until the Transparency RTS apply.
The ESAs stated that they expect Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.
In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) and make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports (see “Description of the Reports”).
Transparency Requirements – Collateral Manager and Issuer arrangements

In relation to the EU Transparency Requirements: (a) the Issuer will be designated as the reporting entity;
(b) the Collateral Manager has undertaken, subject to any confidentiality restrictions applicable to it, in the Collateral Management Agreement to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer any
reports, data and other information required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors and the Competent Authorities, the reports and information necessary to fulfil the EU Transparency Requirements; and (c) the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) will undertake in the Collateral Management Agreement to make available such reports and information by means of a website accessible by investors, Competent Authorities and, upon request, potential investors.
Once the Transparency RTS apply, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Transparency RTS. Prior to the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, the Issuer intends to fulfil the requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and
(e) of Article 7(l) through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”). The Joint Statement is not a legally binding document and there is currently uncertainty in relation to the legal position as regards the form of quarterly reporting until the date of application of the Transparency RTS. Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies the EU Transparency Requirements and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager as the originator, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy the EU Transparency Requirements.
Whether the Collateral Manager will be able to obtain and provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the EU Transparency Requirements is unclear.
Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the originator as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the reporting entity), or by Collateral Manager, to fulfil the EU Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.
If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
The Collateral Manager is required to indemnify the Issuer for Collateral Manager Breaches (as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement) in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Collateral Manager may be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager (See “Description of the Collateral Management Agreement – General” below). Investors should note that in respect of such indemnity by the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager shall only indemnify the Issuer in instances where it has acted in a manner constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach or gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts), whereas the administrative sanctions under the Securitisation Regulation described above may be applied to the Issuer on the basis of ordinary negligence. Accordingly, should the Issuer be subject to any administrative sanctions due to the Collateral Manager’s negligence, the Issuer may be unable to have recourse to the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Manager’s indemnity described above.
Jurisdictional Scope of the Securitisation Regulation Obligations

As regards the jurisdictional scope of the direct risk retention obligation, the Explanatory Memorandum to the original European Commission proposal for a Securitisation Regulation implied that the direct obligation would not apply where none of the originator, sponsor or original lender is established in the EU. The European Banking Authority (the “EBA”) confirmed this interpretation (in its “Feedback on the public consultation” section of its Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards published on 31 July 2018) where it said: “The EBA agrees however that a “direct” obligation should apply only to originators,
sponsors and original lenders established in the EU as suggested by the Commission in the explanatory memorandum.” This EBA interpretation is, however, non-binding and not legally enforceable.
The Securitisation Regulation is silent as to the jurisdictional scope of the EU Transparency Requirements, and it is unclear if they apply where none of originator, sponsor and SSPE is established in the EU. The Securitisation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which amend the Securitisation Regulations 2018 so as to implement provisions of the Securitisation Regulation in the domestic law of the United Kingdom following Brexit, provide that the EU Transparency Requirements are to be implemented in the United Kingdom in a way such that substantial compliance with those requirements would be required where the originator, sponsor and SSPE are established outside the United Kingdom.
Uncertainties in the Scope of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements

Aspects of the detail and effect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and what is, or will be, required to demonstrate compliance to Competent Authorities remain unclear. The EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements by an institution similar to the Retention Holder. Furthermore, any relevant regulator’s views with regard to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.
Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
No assurance can be given that the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.
Relevant investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of the information described herein for the purposes of complying with any relevant requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agent, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any information described herein is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention Notes) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal or regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.
U.S. Risk Retention Rules
On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). On February 9, 2018, a three- judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (the “LSTA Decision”). The Panel’s opinion
in the LSTA Decision became effective on April 5, 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on April 3, 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof.
As a result the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that it will not retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; provided, however, that the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes on the Issue Date, with the intention of complying with the EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Retention Requirements. Accordingly investors will not be entitled to the protections previously afforded by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that required CLO collateral managers to have “skin in the game” and to comply with certain disclosure obligations specified in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.
No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for the type of transaction contemplated herein (a “New Risk Retention Rule” and together with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, “U.S. Retention Regulations”), and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.
If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.
In the event that the U.S. Retention Regulations become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuer’s ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to the consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to each such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required under the Trust Deed with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self- interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuers and/or any holders of Notes).
Recent developments concerning the treatment of CLOs for certain Japanese investors
On March 15, 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitization Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitization transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitization Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitization exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitization, including the establishment and utilization of a due diligence system for evaluating securitized products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitization transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitization Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organization of the securitized product,” retains at least 5 per cent. of the securitized exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitization Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5 per cent. retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitized exposures”).
The JFSA Securitization Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.
The JFSA Securitization Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining the Retention Notes with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitization Regulation.
Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Debt Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed,” that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitization Regulation.
It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitization Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitization Regulation.
2.3 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Collateral Manager in Order to Comply with Risk Retention
The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements—Securitisation Regulation” above is that affected investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation. The five per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the greater of the Aggregate Collateral Balance and the Target Par Amount. The Retention Holder has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding being, at any time, an amount equal to no less than 5 per cent. of the greater of (i) the Aggregate Collateral Balance and (ii) the Target Par Amount.
Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention Requirements.
In particular, if, at any time, the deposit of Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager cause (or would be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency, all or a portion of any Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments will instead be deposited into the Interest Account in an amount sufficient in order to ensure that no EU Retention Deficiency occurs, provided that Trading Gains may only be paid into the Interest Account if, after giving effect to such payment, the Aggregate Collateral Balance is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Amount. In addition, the Collateral Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations where such reinvestment would cause an EU Retention Deficiency. As a result, the Collateral Manager may be prevented from reinvesting available proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations in circumstances where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise have been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations.
Also, the Issuer may not issue further Notes (a) without the Retention Holder consenting to such issuance and; (b) where such issuance would result in non-compliance by the Retention Holder with the EU Retention Requirements.
As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.
2.4 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are “non-financial counterparties” (or third country entities equivalent to “financial counterparties” or “non-financial counterparties”). EMIR was amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/834 (“EMIR REFIT”).
Types of entities and obligations

Financial counterparties (“FC”) (as defined in EMIR and EMIR REFIT) are subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties that have become subject to the clearing obligation, depending on certain clearing thresholds as introduced under EMIR REFIT that exempt small financial counterparties (“SFC”) from the clearing obligation. All counterparties must report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”) (in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates – although see below for upcoming changes to the reporting obligation), and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the “margin requirement”). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a FC, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements or restricting of their terms.
All alternative investment funds are now financial counterparties

EMIR REFIT brought into the FC definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”). Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be NFCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds were out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs. Under the amended definition of a FC in EMIR REFIT, such funds will now be regarded as TCEs that would be FCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that EU FCs will be required to ensure compliance with the clearing obligation and margin requirements for uncleared derivatives when trading with such funds.
Securitisation special purpose entities are excluded from categorisation as a FC under EMIR REFIT.
Reporting

Under EMIR REFIT, from June 2020, the FC (or the manager, in the case of an EU AIF) will be solely responsible, and legally liable for the reporting, albeit non-financial counterparties (“NFC”) will be under an obligation to provide to their FC counterparty those relevant details that the FC cannot be reasonably expected to hold. It is therefore expected that the Issuer’s counterparty under the Hedge Agreements will be solely responsible for reporting when this provision comes into effect.
Further, under EMIR REFIT, non-financial counterparties below the clearing threshold (“NFC-”) do not have to report if facing a third country FC, where the legal regime or reporting to which the third country FC is subject has been declared equivalent, and the third country FC has reported to a repository that is subject to a legally valid and enforceable obligation to grant EU regulators access to data.
Under EMIR REFIT, NFCs have to calculate their aggregate month-end average positions for the previous 12 months. If the Issuer does not so calculate its positions (or if the calculations were to indicate that the relevant threshold is exceeded), the Issuer will have to immediately notify ESMA and the relevant competent authority and establish clearing arrangements within four months.
Clearing obligation
The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 and specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under “Category 1”) to June 2021 (for counterparties that are grouped under “Category 3”).
NFC- and SFCs are exempted from the clearing obligation (and in the case of NFC-, of certain additional risk mitigation obligations such as the posting of collateral) provided that, (i) in the case of NFCs, the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group” (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives), however, once the threshold under one asset class is exceeded, OTC derivatives (of that NFC) falling just under that class become clearable, and (ii), in the case of FCs, the same thresholds apply, but FCs: (A) cannot exclude their hedging transactions from the threshold calculations, and (B) once the threshold under one asset class is exceeded, all OTC derivatives of that FC become clearable. If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any NFC within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.
Margin requirements

On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the “RTS”). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.
The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect through a staged implementation period. The margin requirements apply to FCs and NFCs above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin.
If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on the ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Collateral Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.
The Conditions allow the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in future.
Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR and EMIR REFIT may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non-financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and
collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Asset Swap Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR and EMIR REFIT in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
2.5 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
AIFMD introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of AIFs. If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR REFIT all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.
There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “SSPEs” (the “SSPE Exemption”). The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, “registered financial vehicle corporations” with the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as an AIF or appoint an AIFM unless the Central Bank issues further guidance advising them to do so.
If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.
The Conditions allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.
2.6 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014,
the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or the Arranger makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
2.7 U.S. Swap Regulations
Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including: (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps, (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Debt Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.
Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but have yet to become effective. It is expected that such regulations will become effective in the next two years, but the SEC has yet to set a compliance date. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.
2.8 Commodity Pool Regulation
The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) provided that (i) at the time such Hedge Agreement is entered into it satisfies the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria or (ii) the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.
In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions
in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.
Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.
2.9 Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.
An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.
It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see “Commodity Pool Regulation” above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.
The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders’ rights in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement Collateral Manager shall only be exercisable upon a
Collateral Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.
In 2018, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitizations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule’s covered fund provisions. In 2019, these agencies adopted final regulations consistent with the amendments proposed in 2018. In addition, in early 2020, these agencies proposed additional amendments to the final regulations, including changes relevant to the treatment of securitizations. In particular, these proposed amendments would narrow the definition of “ownership interest,” ease certain aspects of the loan securitization exclusion, and create additional exclusions from the “covered fund” definition. It is unclear at this time which if any of the proposed amendments ultimately will be adopted, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Collateral Manager.
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.
2.10 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. Investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Changes in capital requirements have been announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and it is uncertain when all such changes will be fully implemented. When fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.
2.11 Flip Clauses
The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payments which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S.
insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.
On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payments, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payments would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payments are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payments, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
2.12 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform
The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has been reformed, with developments including:
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers’ Association in February 2014;
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.
In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.
The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.
It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.
The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, “EURIBOR”), together with LIBOR, and other so-called “benchmarks” are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.
In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.
The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively.
Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):
(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent;
(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark; and
(c) circumstances that may require that the administrator of a “benchmark” (or its regulatory supervisor or a related competent authority) makes a public statement announcing that it has ceased or will cease to provide such “benchmark”.
Investors should be aware that:
(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”
(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:
(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and
(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Debt Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Debt Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;
(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest). In general, fall-back mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have, where applicable, consented within the timescale provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. Condition 14(c)(xxxi) (Modification and Waiver) provides that the Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, enter into one or more supplemental trust deeds or make any other modification or waiver to any provision of any Transaction Document to change the applicable reference rate. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes.
Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR or LIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes (other than the Class B Notes). No assurance may be provided that the relevant changes will not be made to EURIBOR or LIBOR and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist. Investors should consider these recent developments when making their investment decision with respect to the Notes.
2.13 Financial Transaction Tax (“FTT”)
In February 2013 the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a FTT requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, other than Estonia, the “Participating Member States”). However, on 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.
Under the Commission Proposal, the proposed FTT would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State or the financial instrument in which the parties are dealing is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.
Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain.
Additional Member States may also decide to participate in the FTT. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to any FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.
2.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures
Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “AML Requirements”). Any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Trustee or the Agents could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Agents and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Agents and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith. A Noteholder may also be obliged to provide information they may have previously identified or regarded as confidential to satisfy the Issuer’s AML Requirements.
2.15 CRA
Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013. CRA3 has subsequently been supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 of 30 September 2014 (the “CRA3 RTS”).
Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have at least two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.
2.16 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
On 5 October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.
The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.
The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.
On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included Ireland and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.
The United Kingdom and Ireland signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and Ireland is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 June 2018 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 January 2019 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019. As a general rule, it will have effect for Ireland’s tax treaties:
(a) with respect to taxes withheld at source, from 1 January 2020; and
(b) with respect to all other taxes levied by Ireland, for taxes levied with respect to taxable periods beginning on or after 1 November 2019.
The date on which the MLI modifies each treaty depends on when Ireland’s treaty partners deposit their own instruments of ratification.
Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument, the United Kingdom and Ireland each provided a list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument, Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions (which have ratified the MLI) by the inclusion of a principal purpose test.
In particular it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to the UK/Ireland double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland (see the risk factor entitled “UK Taxation of the Issuer” below for further information in relation to the circumstances in which the Issuer could be treated as having a UK permanent establishment for UK tax purposes), in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.
It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.
Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see the risk factor entitled “EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2” below)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.
If as a consequence of the application of Action 6, United Kingdom tax were imposed on the net income or profits of the Issuer, the amount of UK tax due would likely be significant on the basis that some or all of the interest which it pays on the Notes may not be deductible for United Kingdom tax purposes. If the UK imposed tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer, this could in certain circumstances constitute a Note Tax Event, following which, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution). See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
In the event that as a result of the application of Action 6 the Issuer were to be denied the benefit of a treaty entered into by Ireland and as a consequence payments of interest were made by an Obligor to the Issuer subject to a withholding or deduction for or on account of tax in respect of any payments of interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations, this may constitute a Collateral Tax Event, following which, the Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution). See Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders).
2.17 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2
As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, and to provide a framework for a harmonised implementation of the BEPS conclusions across the EU, the EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “ATAD 1”) on 12 July 2016. The EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2” and together with ATAD 1, “ATAD”) on 29 May 2017, amending the ATAD 1, to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU member states and third countries. EU member states had until 31 December 2018 to implement ATAD 1 (subject, in certain cases, to derogations for EU member states which have equivalent measures in their domestic law) and have until 31 December 2019 to implement the ATAD 2 (except for measures relating to reverse hybrid mismatches, which must be implemented by 31 December 2021 and which will apply as of 1 January 2022). The Directives contain various measures that could, depending on their implementation in Ireland, potentially result in certain payments made by the Issuer ceasing to be fully deductible. This could increase the Issuer’s liability to tax. There are two measures of particular relevance.
First, ATAD provides for an “interest limitation rule” which restricts the deductible interest of an entity to the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. However, the interest limitation only applies to the net borrowing costs of an entity (being the amount by which its borrowing costs exceed its taxable interest revenues and other economically equivalent taxable revenues).
Under the directive, Member States have a number of choices regarding implementation, including an option to allow taxpayers to deduct borrowing costs up to €3 million, and to exempt certain entities, such as entities which qualify as financial undertakings. Ireland has not published draft legislation indicating which of the various options and derogations it will implement. Accordingly, the manner in which the interest deductibility limitation rule will apply is uncertain.
The date from which the rules will be implemented is also uncertain. In 2016, the then Irish Minister for Finance stated that Ireland would not introduce the interest limitation rules until 2024. However, the Irish Department of Finance has more recently stated that Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission in this regard and commenced work to examine options to bring forward the process of transposition from the original planned deadline of end of 2023. The Irish Department of Finance have stated that it is anticipated that transposition could advance which would lead to implementation at a date which is earlier than 2024.
Until the timing and manner of implementation of the interest deductibility limitation rule is known, it is not possible to provide detailed guidance on the impact of the rule on the Issuer's Irish tax position.
Secondly, the ATAD provides for hybrid mismatch rules. A hybrid mismatch arrangement is a cross- border arrangement that generally uses a hybrid entity or hybrid instrument and results in a mismatch in the tax treatment of a payment across jurisdictions.
Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive II covers hybrid mismatches arising between (i) associated enterprises,
(ii) head offices and permanent establishments and (iii) permanent establishments of the same entity or
(iv) under structured arrangements. The forms of hybrid mismatch that are most like to be relevant to an entity such as the Issuer relate to financial instrument mismatches and hybrid entity mismatches.
In very broad terms, if a hybrid mismatch results from differences in the characterisation of a financial instrument financial instrument, the EU member state where the payment is sourced from shall deny the deduction, unless another territory has already done so. Financial instrument is very broadly defined to include any instrument that gives rise to a financing or equity returned that is taxed under the rules for taxing debt, equity or derivatives under the law of either jurisdiction involved. The rules in relation to financial instrument mismatches could impact financing arrangements such as preferred or convertible equity certificates (PECs or CPECs), but also debt instruments which are "stapled" with an equity instrument or which are treated as debt in one jurisdiction and as equity in another jurisdiction.
The new rules also deal with so-called hybrid entities where an entity or arrangements is regarded as a taxable entity in one jurisdiction and whose income or expenditure is treated as income or expenditure of one or more persons in another jurisdiction. These provisions could impact entities which "check the box" for US tax purposes and are treated as transparent.
EU member states were required to implement these rules by December 31, 2019 except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.
The Issuer's tax treatment may be impacted by the implementation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive II in other EU jurisdictions.
The Issuer's Irish tax position may be impacted by Ireland's implementation of the anti-hybrid legislation which occurred as part of Finance Act 2019. To the extent the Issuer is deemed to be associated with any of its Noteholders, or is engaged in certain transactions which have, as their purpose, the exploitation of hybrid mismatches, these anti-hybrid rules may impact the deductibility of payments of interest by the Issuer to certain Noteholders. Associated for these purposes includes direct and indirect participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 25% or more or an entitlement to receive 25 % or more (50% in certain circumstances) of the profits of that entity as well as entities that are part of the same
consolidated group for financial accounting purposes or enterprises that have a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer.
Noteholders are not currently anticipated to be persons who would be considered associated with the Issuer, merely by reason of holding Notes.
2.18 Taxation Implications of Contributions
A Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Contribution in accordance with Condition 2(m) (Contributions). Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Contribution. Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment to them of making a Contribution in accordance with Condition 2(m) (Contributions).
2.19 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer / Irish Value Added Tax Treatment of the Collateral Management Fees
The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish domestic law, the Collateral Management Fees should be exempt from VAT. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a “qualifying company” as defined in section 110 of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended (the “TCA”).
This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the “VAT Directive”), which provides that Member States shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” as defined by Member States.
Historically, a similar position has been taken by the Netherlands, though recent developments have changed this and, in February 2020 the Dutch tax authorities issued letters to participants in the Dutch CLO Market explaining that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in the Netherlands with effect from 1 April 2019. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. However, on 22 April 2020, the Dutch tax authorities subsequently provided written guidance confirming that, although collateral management and administration fees remain subject to VAT, this will not apply with retroactive effect.
The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS.
Partly in response to the Fiscale Eenheid X case, the European Commission has asked the VAT Committee (an advisory body comprising representatives from tax authorities of all of the Member States and chaired by a representative from the European Commission) to shed light on the types of entities that can also qualify as “special investment funds”. A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a “special investment fund” if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.
The views expressed by the VAT Committee are merely advisory and do not necessarily have the agreement of the European Commission. Furthermore, its views are not legally binding and the courts may disagree with them. There is nevertheless a risk that the European Commission will accept the views of the VAT Committee and will conclude that entities such as the Issuer cannot qualify as a “special investment funds” because they are either not subject to the right sort of regulatory supervision in Ireland and/or because they do not target the same circle of investors as UCITS.
Member States have a degree of discretion on how to define “special investment funds”, and therefore there are some discrepancies amongst Member States on the meaning of the term. The Fiscale Eenheid X case was about how broad that discretion is. The application of the VAT exemption for “special investment funds” could now be reviewed at a Member State level and/or by the European Commission to ensure that the definitions used are within the ambit of discretion permitted by the VAT Directive.
The Issuer is not aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management fees paid by entities such as the Issuer. However, it is possible that some Member States (including Ireland) could change their domestic VAT laws, or the European Commission could require them to do so. If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Collateral Management Fees. The standard VAT rate in Ireland is currently 23%. It is also possible that Ireland could be required to recover the benefit of the VAT exemption obtained before the date on which the law changes from the Issuer together with interest.
The imposition of VAT in Ireland on the Collateral Management Fees will not constitute a Note Tax Event or a Collateral Tax Event. Accordingly, Noteholders will not become entitled to redeem the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) as a consequence thereof. Furthermore, it may not be possible to substitute the Issuer with another company that is incorporated in another jurisdiction within the European Economic Area that does not charge VAT on CLO collateral management fees.
2.20 Increased Tax in the Issuer
In certain circumstances, there may be restrictions on the tax deductibility of interest, funding expenses or other expenses paid or payable by the Issuer. Such restrictions or changes could increase the amount of Irish or other tax payable by the Issuer.
Firstly, restrictions on deductibility of interest or funding expenses could arise due to the provisions of Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive I or Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive II, or the Irish legislation enacting such directives as described previously.
Secondly, under Irish tax law restrictions on deductibility of interest could arise if the Issuer acquires assets related to Irish land. These restrictions apply to qualifying companies which carry on a business of holding, managing or both holding and managing of assets described as “specified mortgages”. Specified mortgages broadly includes loans secured on and deriving their value from Irish real estate, units in an Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) or shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value from Irish land. These restrictions should not apply where the Issuer is engaged in a transaction which qualifies as a “CLO transaction”. A CLO transaction is defined as a securitisation transaction carried out in conformity with a prospectus or offering circular (as applicable), within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation. In addition, based on the prospectus and the activities of the qualifying company, it must be reasonable to consider that the acquisition of specified mortgages was not the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the qualifying company. As such, the restrictions on deductibility should not apply if either: (a) the Issuer does not hold or manage specified mortgages; or (b) the Issuer’s activities fall within the definition of a CLO transaction. If these conditions are not satisfied, the Issuer's ability to deduct it's financing costs may be impacted.
Thirdly, section 110 provides that certain results dependent or excessive interest payments to a "specified person" may not be deductible unless, broadly, those payments are subject to tax in an EU member state or a jurisdiction with which Ireland has signed a double taxation agreement. A person will be a specified person if they control the Issuer, or are under common control with the Issuer. In broad terms, a person will have control in this context if they have the ability to secure, through shares, voting power or the constitutional documents of the Issuer, that the affairs of the Issuer are conducted in accordance with their wishes. Finance Act 2019 has extended the concept of specified person to mean that a person will control the Issuer (and therefore be a specified person), if they have:
(i) an ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the Issuer (“significant influence”); and
(ii) hold more than 20% of any of (i) the share capital of the Issuer, (ii) the principal value of any securities which carry a right to interest or distributions which are to any extent dependent on the results of the Issuer's business or exceed a reasonable commercial rate or (iii) the right to more than 20% of the interest payable on securities described at (ii).
These latter provisions are only likely to be relevant to holders of the Subordinated Notes who are entitled to more than 20% of the participations described above and who are have significant influence over the
Issuer. Significant influence is a new concept in Irish law and its meaning is uncertain. There is currently no Revenue guidance published on the concept.
If any payment was made by the Issuer to a specified person where such payment is not subject to tax in the manner noted above, the Issuer may not be entitled to take a deduction for such payment for tax purposes and the Issuer would be subject to tax on any profits which are treated as arising for Irish tax purposes. In addition, withholding tax may be required to be levied on the payment to the Noteholder.
Fourthly, deductibility may be restricted where the interest or other distribution paid, or the security to which the payment relates forms part of any arrangement or scheme of which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is the avoidance of Irish tax or could not reasonably be considered to be for bona fide commercial purposes.
Finally, in the future there may be other changes in Irish or non-Irish tax law, regulations, interpretation, treaties or other measures which could give rise to increased Irish tax liabilities of the Issuer.
2.21 The Common Reporting Standard
The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) (“FIs”) relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implements the CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year (or from 2018 in the case of Austria).
Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS while the Finance Act 2014 of Ireland and the Finance Act 2015 of Ireland contain measures necessary to implement the CRS internationally and across the European Union, respectively. The Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 of Ireland (the “Regulations”) giving effect to the CRS from 1 January 2016 came into operation on 31 December 2015.
Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 50 countries, including Ireland and all EU Members States (known as the “Early Adopter Group”) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners have indicated that Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding, to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.
The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or
any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance,
(iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.
2.22 Regulated Banking Activity
While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non-bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.
Collateral Debt Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.
2.23 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.
The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the
bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.
The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.
2.24 U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts
U.S. regulators have adopted final rules and interpretative guidance setting forth limitations on certain insolvency-related default rights of parties to certain “qualified financial contracts” (“QFCs”) entered into with counterparties that have been designated as systemically important, along with certain of such entities’ subsidiaries and affiliates (each, a “Covered Entity”). Such rules and guidance (the “QFC Stay Rules”) generally require: (i) the Covered Entity to ensure that any stays imposed as a result of the entry of such entity into certain liquidation proceedings are contractually acknowledged by the counterparty to the QFC (in particular, where the relevant QFC is governed by non-U.S. law and/or the counterparty is located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction); and (ii) the Covered Entity to not agree in its QFCs to certain types of cross-defaults that are related, directly or indirectly, to the entry into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding of certain affiliates of the Covered Entity. If a Covered Entity enters into a contract with the Issuer that is subject to the QFC Stay Rules, the Covered Entity will be responsible for ensuring that such QFC complies with the QFC Stay Rules. As a result of the application of such rules, the Issuer may be required to accept limitations in its insolvency-related default rights against the Covered Entity.
2.25 Centre of Main Interests
The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), the Issuer’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.
As the Issuer’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute “proof to the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties” would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is
different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.
As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer
Neither the Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of their Affiliates) is under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.
In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
3.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility
The market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may require the consent of the Collateral Manager and in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
3.3 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:
(i) on any Payment Date (or with the Collateral Manager’s consent, any Business Day) on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution; or
(ii) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Collateral Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).
In addition, the Rated Notes of any Class may be redeemed in part by entire Class from Refinancing Proceeds at the applicable Redemption Prices, from any Refinancing Proceeds on any Payment Date (or with the Collateral Manager’s consent, on any Business Day) falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period, at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. Any such redemption shall be of an entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to a number of conditions. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
In addition, any Reset Amendment (including any amendment to the Transaction Documents that would otherwise have required an Extraordinary Resolution of the relevant Class or Classes of Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14(b)(vii) (Extraordinary Resolution)) were it not made at the same time as a Refinancing of all Classes of Rated Notes in whole, may be approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Subordinated Noteholders . See Condition 14(b)(vii) (Extraordinary Resolution).
As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders but subject to the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing). It should be noted that following the publication of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules it is unclear whether a Refinancing or the issuance of additional notes will trigger the U.S. Risk Retention Rules if such action is taken after 24 December 2016. As such, the ability of the Issuer and the Noteholders to issue additional notes or enter into a Refinancing may be impacted. See “U.S. Risk Retention Rules” above.
The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to facilitate the Issuer to effect a Refinancing in part. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).
The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.
The Collateral Manager may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Payment Date falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 20.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payments. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.
3.4 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the option of the Collateral Manager
The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion certifies to the Trustee that it has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.
3.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes
Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders and the Class E Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders , including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Conditions 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests) and 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event).
3.6 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator, the Rating Agencies and the Trustee that it is unable to reinvest in additional Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.
3.7 The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management Agreement. See “The Portfolio – Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period” below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
3.8 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and a Note Event of Default
(a) Additional Issuances
At any time, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuance) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution and the separate approval of both the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager (and, in the case of the issuance of additional Class A Notes, the separate approval of the Class A Noteholders acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution), the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of,
and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Debt Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) to be applied as Interest Proceeds. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuance).
(b) Redirection of funds to reinvestment
The Collateral Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payments, redirect funds (including by deferring, designating for reinvestment or waiving payment of some or all of its Collateral Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations or other Permitted Uses.
(c) Collateral Manager Advances
The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(l) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Outstanding Collateral Manager Advances may accrue interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 2.0 per cent. per annum.
Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations” below).
3.9 Additional Issuances of Subordinated Notes not subject to Anti-Dilution Rights
The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including that the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. However, this requirement does not apply to any additional issuance of Class M-1 Subordinated Notes if such additional issuance is required in order to prevent or cure an EU Retention Deficiency for any reason including but not limited to where such EU Retention Deficiency will occur due to an additional issuance of any Class of Notes. Accordingly, the proportion of Class M- 1 Subordinated Notes held by a Class M-1 Subordinated Noteholder may be diluted following an additional issuance of Class M-1 Subordinated Notes. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuance).
3.10 Limited recourse obligations
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee, the Agents, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Liquidity Facility Provider or any of their respective Affiliates or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other Person or entity will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (including the amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Profit Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Corporate Services Agreement and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Custodian, any Agent, any
Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class E Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class D Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class C Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class B Noteholders, and (f) sixthly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, examinership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer.
3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders
Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) position was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.
3.12 Subordination of the Notes
Except as described below, the Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes; the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes; the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes; the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes; and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.
Except as described below the payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Collateral Enhancement Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account in the event that the Interest Diversion Test is not satisfied on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period only.
Investors should note that, pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer may obtain Liquidity Drawings for the purpose of payment of any shortfall in the amount available to pay amounts due and payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payments, subject to the conditions set out therein (see “Description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement”). As such, Liquidity Drawings may be obtained to pay amounts payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payments which rank lower than one or more Classes of Notes, including in payment of Collateral Management Fees or distributions to the Subordinated Noteholders. Any such Liquidity Drawing will be repayable by the Issuer senior to payments on the Notes and, as a result, any such Liquidity Drawing would have the effect of increasing the leverage inherent in the
holding of any Class of Notes payment on which would rank senior to the relevant payment funded by such Liquidity Drawing. See “Liquidity Facility Risk” below.
Non payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes or Class E Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payments will not constitute a Note Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date when such Notes are redeemed in full, unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption in full of the Class C Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and following redemption in full of the Class D Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable, (in each case where such non payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). In such circumstances, the Controlling Class, acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default).
In the event of any redemption in full or acceleration of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic redemption and/or acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Subordinated Noteholders, then by the Class E Noteholders, then by the Class D Noteholders, then by the Class C Noteholders, then by the Class B Noteholders and finally, by the Class A Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of: (i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; and (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. In the event that the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and conflicts of interest).
3.13 Calculation of Rate of Interest
If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Floating Rate of
Interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Issuer is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Floating Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Floating Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Floating Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Floating Rate of Interest on any other basis.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear due to EURIBOR being discontinued (or in the other circumstances referred to in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), investors should note that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager) may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders. See “LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform” above.
3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes or to pay residual interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priority of Payments, will not be a Note Event of Default.
Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
3.15 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited
The Monthly Reports, the Effective Date Report, the Payment Date Reports and, following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements and to the extent the Collateral Administrator has agreed to provide such reporting in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.
3.16 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.
Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.
The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.
As at the date of this Offering Circular, Moody’s is established in the UK and each of S&P and KBRA is established in the European Union and each such Rating Agency is registered under CRA3. As such, each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that any of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations

Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Notes.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the arranger

On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product such as this transaction paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer (and the Issuer has appointed the Information Agent under the Collateral Management Agreement to assist it in the performance of such obligations).
Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications as described above. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction (or the Information Agent fails to perform its duties under the Collateral Management Agreement), such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes, as applicable. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for the purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.
Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes.

The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules.
If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations
The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling on 18 December 2032 (subject to adjustment for non Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Debt Obligations. Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Debt Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.
Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward-looking statements and are inherently uncertain

Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Debt Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Debt Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
3.18 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.
In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Debt Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of
distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See “Mandatory Redemption of the Notes” above.
Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.
3.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes
It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.
3.20 Withholding Tax on the Notes
So long as the Notes remain listed on the Global Exchange Market or another recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA and the Notes are held in a “recognised clearing system” for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA or interest on the Notes is paid by a paying agent that is not in Ireland, no withholding tax under current law is expected to be imposed in Ireland on payments of interest on the Notes. However there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 2(i) (Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution or the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances and in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
3.21 Book entry Holders are not Considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed, which may Delay Receipt of Payments on the Notes
Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.
Noteholders owning a book entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See “Form of the Notes”.
3.22 Security
Clearing Systems: Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents (the “Euroclear Account”) and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate; and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub-custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Debt Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Debt Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.
In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Debt Obligations.
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Agents, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.
Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge.
However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
3.23 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10.0 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.
The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution
may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes. If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter.
There are, however, quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or an Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution.
In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.
Any Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes and any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution (other than, in the case of Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person, a CM Replacement Resolution in respect of the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager which is not Affiliated to the Collateral Manager and where the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager is not due to the Collateral Manager having been removed due to a Collateral Manager Event of Default in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Conditions).
Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.
Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.
Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.
Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could have an adverse impact on certain Noteholders.
Certain entrenched rights relating to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payments, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.
In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).
Each Hedge Counterparty or Liquidity Facility Provider may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement or Liquidity Facility Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.
3.24 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes
If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).
3.25 Enforcement rights following a Note Event of Default
If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), give notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and each Hedge Counterparty that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following a Note Event of Default described in Conditions 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) or 10(a)(vii) (Illegality), such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes) and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to the Priority of Payments; (B) otherwise, in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in Conditions 10(a)(i) (Non- payment of interest), 10(a)(ii) (Non-payment of principal) or 10(a)(iv) (Collateral Debt Obligations) the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Note Event of Default; or (C) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes acting independently by way of Ordinary Resolution may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement
and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests to certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.
3.26 Certain ERISA Considerations
Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes or the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled “Certain ERISA Considerations” below.
3.27 Forced Transfer
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule 144A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Holder”) or a Noteholder is a Non- Permitted ERISA Holder, the Issuer may, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder or a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Holder or a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder or a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) within 30 days (or 10 days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder) of the date of such notice. If such Holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder), (a) upon direction from the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, a Transfer Agent, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, may cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a commercially reasonable sale to a person or entity that certifies to such Transfer Agent and the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.
In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that, if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
3.28 U.S. Tax Risks
Changes in tax law; imposition of tax on Non-U.S. Holders

Distributions on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain recognised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the payments or gain are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States or, in the case of gain, the Non-U.S. Holder is a
non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale, and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Holders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.
U.S. trade or business

If the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a “United States real property interest” or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to a Note Event of Default or a Collateral Manager Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Possible treatment of Class E Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Class E Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a “protective” qualified electing fund election with respect to their Class E Notes. Alternatively, if the Class E Notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of those Notes could be subject to the rules pertaining to 10 per cent United States shareholders of CFCs. See “Tax Considerations - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes - Possible Treatment of Class E Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes.”
Additional notes not issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any additional Rated Notes issued after the Issue Date in accordance with Condition 17 (Additional Issuance) may not be treated as part of the same issue for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the Outstanding Notes of the same Class that were previously issued. As a result, different blocks of Rated Notes could be treated differently for U.S. federal income tax purposes from other blocks of the same Class. If all blocks of a Class of Rated Notes bear the same securities identifier, the Issuer and holders may not be able to distinguish between different blocks of that Class. As a result, information returns furnished to investors may not accurately reflect the amount of OID required to be accrued by them.
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” below.
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL
4.1 The Portfolio
The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Debt Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Debt Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.
None of the Issuer, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser, has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, any other Agents, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Agents, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.
Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Debt Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Debt Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults
The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Senior Unsecured Obligations, Second Lien Loans, High Yield Bonds, PIK Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Debt Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Debt Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.
To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Debt Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub- investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Debt Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.
The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Collateral Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor’s participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Collateral Manager, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole
responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Debt Obligations. Except for a right to approve purchases under the Warehouse Arrangements as described below, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser has not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.
4.3 The Warehouse Arrangements
Prior to the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date pursuant to a financing arrangement (the “Warehouse Arrangements”). The Warehouse Arrangements were provided primarily by NATIXIS, London Branch and the Retention Holder, as initial senior lenders and certain subordinated lenders (including the Retention Holder and third party subordinated lenders), some of whom could choose to invest in the Notes (being, together with NATIXIS, London Branch and the Retention Holder, the “Warehouse Providers”). Some of the Collateral Debt Obligations may have been acquired from the Warehouse Providers. The Warehouse Arrangements must be terminated in all respects on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements must be repaid on or prior to the Issue Date, including from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Warehouse Providers in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date.
The prices paid for such Collateral Debt Obligations will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Debt Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions, international political events and other macroeconomic events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date. See “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”.
In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Debt Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Providers under the Warehouse Arrangements on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Debt Obligations from the date such Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Debt Obligations during such period provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Providers (other than in relation to Originator Assets, in respect of which the risk will be borne by the Collateral Manager during the period commencing on the date the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Originator Asset, and ending on the date falling 15 Business Days thereafter), provided further that any net realised gains and/or losses in respect of the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date will be for the account of the Warehouse Providers.
For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Debt Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.
The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only (i) at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Debt Obligation is entered into, (ii) in respect of Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations, on the Issue Date and (iii) in respect of certain of the Eligibility Criteria that comprise the Restructured Obligation Criteria, those Collateral Debt Obligations which are the subject of a restructuring (whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Debt Obligation or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor), on the applicable Restructuring
Date, and, in each case, any failure by such Collateral Debt Obligation to satisfy the relevant Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.
By its purchase of the Notes, each Noteholder is deemed to have consented to the purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer and the arrangements described above.
4.4 Considerations relating to the Initial Investment Period
During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Debt Obligations in order to satisfy, as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests. See “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. See “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions upon the acquisition of Non Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Asset Swap Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Asset Swap Transactions. See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Debt Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Debt Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or enter into required Asset Swap Transactions during such period could result in the non confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.
Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Debt Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.5 Prepayment Risk
Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.
4.6 Defaults and Recoveries
There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.
A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.
Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations” below.
For the purpose of the foregoing “Senior Obligations” means Secured Senior Loans, Senior Secured Bonds and Unsecured Senior Loans.
4.7 Underlying Portfolio
Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations

The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance must consist of Senior Secured Loans and Senior Secured Bonds in aggregate (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior
Loans and Secured Senior Bonds and the balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date. Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.
Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.
Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.
Some Collateral Debt Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Interest Rate Risk” below.
The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will
have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.
Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations

In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations

The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Debt Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants . Ownership of Cov- Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make
a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds

High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.
High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.
The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.
European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.
In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations” below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks

The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged
collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) ”debtor-in- possession” financings.
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Debt Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Debt Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Debt Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligation.
Characteristics of Senior Unsecured Obligations

The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Senior Unsecured Obligations. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Senior Unsecured Obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Senior Unsecured Obligations occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.
4.8 Corporate Rescue Loans
Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.
Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to
U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.
4.9 Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time and from Contributions by Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payments rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payments are subject to the following caps:
(i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €2,500,000 and (ii) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all applicable Payment Dates may not exceed
€15,000,000.
The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligation will be partially dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).
Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Interest Diversion Test.
To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, an “Collateral Manager Advance”) to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payments.
4.10 Balloon obligations and bullet obligations present refinancing risk
The Collateral will primarily consist of Collateral Debt Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Debt Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Debt Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Debt Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Debt Obligation on a timely basis or at all.
4.11 Limited control of administration and amendment of Collateral Debt Obligations
As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the
Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Debt Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its Collateral management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
4.12 Participations, Novations and Assignments
The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Debt Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub-participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub-participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.
The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.
Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest of the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached
by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.
In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above.
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Aggregate Collateral Balance.
4.13 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders
The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Debt Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.
4.14 Counterparty risk
Assignments, Participations, Hedge Transactions and the Liquidity Facility Agreement involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.
If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies.
Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive” above. Transactions with counterparties that are Covered Entities for the purposes of the QFC Stay Rules may also be subject to the limitations in such rules. See “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.
4.15 Concentration risk
Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio—Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.
4.16 Credit risk
Risks applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.
4.17 Interest rate risk
The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Debt Obligations (in particular High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 12.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations.
In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such Hedge Transaction is in a form in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has previously received approval from each Rating Agency) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “Commodity Pool Regulation” above. In particular, the Issuer may enter into the Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions on or about the Issue Date in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in EURIBOR or LIBOR-based payments of interest payable by the Issuer under the Rated Notes as further described in “Hedging Arrangements”. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure.
In addition, some Collateral Debt Obligations permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Debt Obligations re-set to semi- annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a
portion of the interest received on Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and any amounts which are able to be drawn in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement (see “Liquidity Facility Risk” below) shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing mismatch. Furthermore, the Portfolio Profile Tests permit up to 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance to comprise Annual Obligations (being Collateral Debt Obligations which, in accordance with their terms, pay interest less frequently than semi-annually).
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payments and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.
4.18 Liquidity Facility Risk
The Issuer shall enter into a liquidity facility agreement (the “Liquidity Facility Agreement”) dated on or about the Issue Date with The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Liquidity Facility Provider”) whereby the Issuer shall under certain circumstances be able to draw down on a liquidity facility to fund payments of interest on each Class of Rated Notes (provided each applicable Coverage Test senior to the payment of Interest Amounts in respect of such Class is satisfied on the relevant Determination Date) in an amount not exceeding the lesser of: (i) the Available Commitment and (ii) the Accrued Collateral Debt Obligation Interest in respect of the relevant Payment Date. See “Description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement”.
The Liquidity Facility is available for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the earliest of (a) the Business Day that is immediately preceding the date that is four years from the Issue Date, subject to renewal for one or two additional one year periods in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement; (b) the date on which the Liquidity Facility is cancelled in its entirety in accordance with its provisions; and (c) the date on which the Rated Notes are redeemed in full, or in each case, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately prior to such day (the “Liquidity Facility Commitment Period”). The Liquidity Facility Commitment Period is therefore expected to be considerably shorter than the term of the Notes. If there is any shortfall in any amounts due and payable by the Issuer under, and in accordance with, the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments on any Payment Date following the expiry of the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period, the Issuer will not be able to obtain Liquidity Drawings for the purpose of payment of such shortfall.
4.19 Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 20.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Asset Swap Obligations denominated in certain Qualifying Currencies and that up to 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations denominated in certain Qualifying Unhedged Obligation Currencies. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limits set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. Although the Issuer intends to hedge against certain currency exposures pursuant to the Asset Swap Transactions it is not required that all Non Euro Obligations must be the subject of an Asset Swap Obligations and some may be Unhedged Collateral Debt Obligations.
Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations may be subject to Asset Swap Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Debt Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non-Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Debt Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Asset Swap Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Asset Swap Counterparties willing to provide Asset Swap Transactions. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “CFTC Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above and “Hedging Arrangements” below.
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Asset Swap Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.
Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Debt Obligations. This may cause losses.
The Issuer will depend upon the Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.
4.20 Long-Dated Collateral Debt Obligations
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity of the Rated Notes provided that up to 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may consist of Long-Dated Collateral Debt Obligations (see further “The Portfolio”). If the CLO is not redeemed prior to the Maturity Date, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) will be required to sell any Long-Dated Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes at the then current market value. In such circumstances the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) will not be able to hold on to such assets to obtain the best price. This could lead to less proceeds available to redeem the Notes on their Maturity Date.
4.21 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances
To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.
During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Debt Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Debt Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds (see “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period” above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such
Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, which will further reduce the Adjusted Aggregate Collateral Balance. Any decrease in the Adjusted Aggregate Collateral Balance will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Debt Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Debt Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations.
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Debt Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Debt Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Debt Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.
4.22 Ratings on Collateral Debt Obligations
The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Interest Diversion Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Moody’s Caa Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Collateral Management Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating. In some instances, the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Debt Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Debt Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Moody’s and S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that may be made up of Collateral Debt Obligations where the Moody’s Rating or the S&P
Rating is derived from the rating of another rating agency and vice versa. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Debt Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Debt Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Debt Obligation in question. Please see “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.
There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Debt Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Moody’s Caa Obligations and S&P CCC Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy the Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Debt Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Interest Diversion Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.23 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Debt Obligations
Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Debt Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Debt Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.
4.24 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination
In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.
In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Debt Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.
The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Debt Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.
4.25 Loan Repricing
Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Debt Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.
4.26 Withholding Tax on the Collateral Debt Obligations
At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can, upon the completion of the relevant procedural formalities be sheltered by application being made under a double tax treaty or otherwise or (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make “gross up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the borrower or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Debt Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
4.27 UK Taxation of the Issuer
In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.
As the Issuer is incorporated in Ireland, the Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.
The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to
do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.
Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK taxation if the specific domestic UK tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non- resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the “Investment Manager Exemption”) is available for the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available if the Collateral Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK taxation if the exemption in Article 8(1) of the UK/Ireland double tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK/Ireland double tax treaty.
Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payments. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a “trade of dealing in or developing UK land”, (b) it disposes of “interests in UK land” or certain assets other than “interests in UK land” which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a “substantial indirect interest” in that land, or (c) with effect from 6th April 2020 it carries on a “UK property business” or has other “UK property income”. However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Debt Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.
If the United Kingdom imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Note Tax Event, following which, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution). See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
4.28 Diverted Profits Tax
The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent. of any “taxable diverted profits”. The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident company’s trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.
If the United Kingdom imposed such a tax on the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Note Tax Event, following which, the Notes of each Class may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the direction of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) or the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution). See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
4.29 Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager is given authority in the Collateral Management Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management Agreement. See “The Portfolio”, “Description of the Collateral Management Agreement” and “The Collateral Manager”. The powers and duties of the Collateral Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Management Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Impaired Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work-outs of Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See “The Portfolio”. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Debt Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time will, in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, be limited to a review of readily available public information and in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations which are bonds which are not publicly listed, any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of bonds and, in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations which are Assignments or Participations of senior and mezzanine loans and in relation to which the Collateral Manager has non- public information, such analysis will include due diligence of the kind common in relation to loans of such kind. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of assets.
In addition, the Collateral Management Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Debt Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Debt Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions set forth in the Collateral Management Agreement.
Pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager will not be liable for any losses or damages resulting from the performance of its duties in accordance with the standard of care under the Collateral Management Agreement, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach, gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts) or reckless disregard in the performance of its obligations thereunder and provided that nothing shall relieve the Collateral Manager from contractual liability under the Collateral Management Agreement if the Collateral Manager fails to perform its duties in accordance with the standard of care specified therein. Investors should note that, for such purpose and notwithstanding that the Notes and the Transaction Documents are governed by English law, the interpretation of “gross negligence” will be made as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts. The concept of “gross negligence” may be interpreted by a New York court as implying a significantly lower standard than negligence on the part of the Collateral Manager than ordinary negligence under English law requiring conduct akin to intentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference. As a result, the Collateral Manager may have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Collateral Management Agreement where it would otherwise have been liable for failing to reach the required standard of care if a mere ordinary negligence standard were applied or if the New York courts were not designated as the courts to interpret the concept of “gross negligence” under the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than entry into the Warehouse Arrangements. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons.
There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.
The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.
The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Debt Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.
In addition, the Collateral Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described herein under “Description of the Collateral Management Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.
The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.
4.30 No Initial Purchaser or Arranger Role Post-Closing
Each of the Initial Purchaser and the Arranger takes no responsibility for, and have no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger or any of their Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.
4.31 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Debt Obligations
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the Interest Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Debt Obligations during the Initial Investment Period (as defined in the Conditions). The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Debt Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations with
the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.
Under the Collateral Management Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Debt Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Debt Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Impaired Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Debt Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Debt Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement.
4.32 Valuation Information; Limited Information
None of the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee, or Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Debt Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.
4.33 Recharacterisation of Trading Gains
If the deposit of any Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency, then Collateral Manager may direct that all or part of any Trading Gains is instead deposited into the Interest Account in an amount sufficient in order to ensure that no EU Retention Deficiency occurs, subject to certain conditions, including that any Trading Gains may only be paid into the Interest Account if, after giving effect to such payment, the Aggregate Collateral Balance being no less than the Reinvestment Target Par Amount. See Condition 3(j)(ii)(Interest Account).
5. RELATING TO CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Initial Purchaser, the Arranger and their respective Affiliates and the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
5.1 Certain Conflicts of Interest Relating to the Collateral Manager
CVC Credit Partners provides investment advisory and sub-advisory services to investment vehicles, including collateralised loan obligations and collateral debt obligations, other collective investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts for institutional investors on a discretionary and non- discretionary basis. The clients of CVC Credit Partners pursue primarily U.S. and European leveraged and performing credit strategies (such as broadly syndicated bank loans, secured and leveraged loans, floating rate loans, second lien loans, corporate and high yield bonds, convertible bonds), alternative credit strategies (such as mezzanine debt, structured products, and illiquid credit), special situations (such as stressed and distressed credit, equity and preferred securities, reorg equity), and mid-market lending (privately negotiated loans to mid-market companies). In the pursuit of these strategies, CVC Credit Partners utilises currency forwards and other derivative instruments on behalf of its clients.
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activities of CVC Credit Partners. CVC Credit Partners is a global alternative asset manager and, as such, may have
multiple advisory management, transactional, financial and other interests that may conflict with those of the Issuer and its Noteholders. CVC may in the future engage in further activities that may result in additional conflicts of interest not addressed below.
Noteholders should note that the Collateral Management Agreement may contain provisions that, subject to applicable law, reduce or eliminate the duties, including fiduciary and other duties, to the Issuer to which the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates would otherwise be subject, provisions that waive or consent to conduct on the part of the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates that might not otherwise be permitted pursuant to such duties, and provisions that limit the remedies of the Issuer with respect to breaches of such duties. If any matter arises that the Collateral Manager determines in its good faith judgment constitutes an actual conflict of interest, the Collateral Manager may take such actions as it determines in good faith may be necessary or appropriate to ameliorate the conflict. Where the Collateral Manager’s arrangements to identify, prevent and manage conflicts of interest are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that risks of damage to the interests of the Collateral Manager’s clients will be prevented, the Collateral Manager shall clearly disclose to the relevant client the general nature and/or sources of conflicts of interest and the steps taken to mitigate those risks before undertaking business on behalf of the client.
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Manager will resolve all conflicts of interest in a manner that is favourable to the Issuer. By acquiring Notes, Noteholders will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of any such actual or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest.
Broad and Wide-Ranging Activities

As a global alternative asset manager, CVC Credit Partners engages in a broad spectrum of activities, including financial advisory and/or management services, investment management, sponsoring and managing private and public investment funds, advising CLOs and other activities. In the ordinary course of its business, CVC Credit Partners engages in activities where its interests or the interests of its clients may conflict with the interests of the Issuer and its Noteholders.
Conflicts of interest that arise between the Issuer, on the one hand, and CVC Credit Partners, any member of CVC Credit Partners, any existing or future affiliated fund or any Other Client, on the other hand, generally will be discussed and resolved on a case-by-case basis by senior management of CVC Credit Partners and representatives of the Collateral Manager, who may be the same individuals. Any such discussions will take into consideration the interests of the relevant parties and the circumstances giving rise to the conflict. Investors should be aware that conflicts will not necessarily be resolved in favour of the Issuer’s interests.
Other Investment Vehicles and Advisory and/or Management Relationships

CVC Credit Partners currently advises and/or manages certain investment vehicles, pooled investment funds and managed account arrangements, and expect in the future to continue to advise and/or manage, various other investment vehicles, pooled investment funds and managed account arrangements (collectively, “Other Clients”), including Other Clients with similar or identical investment objectives, strategies and policies to those of the Issuer, and which issue instruments similar to the Notes (which the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates may acquire for their own account or on behalf of such Other Clients or funds) and it is anticipated that such Other Clients may make investments which are similar or identical to the Issuer’s investments and which may create a potential conflict of interest for CVC. Further, CVC Credit Partners may engage in transactions for Other Clients which may potentially conflict with the interests of the Issuer and the investors in the Notes, including by taking a short position (for example, by buying protection under a credit default swap) in one or more Collateral Debt Obligations held by the Issuer, or the underlying Obligor of one or more Collateral Debt Obligations (and/or other debt tranches or equity of such Obligor). Other Clients, whether now existing or created in the future, could compete with the Issuer for the purchase and sale of investment opportunities.
Collateral Manager Related Persons may engage in transactions or investments or cause or advise Other Clients to engage in transactions or investments which may differ from or be identical to the transactions or investments engaged in by the Collateral Manager for the Issuer without notifying Noteholders. Such advice or transactions may be effected at prices or rates that are more or less favourable than the prices or rates applying to transactions effected for the Issuer and may affect the prices and availability of
Collateral Debt Obligations in which the Issuer invests or seeks to invest. To the extent permitted by law, the Collateral Manager is permitted to aggregate orders for the Issuer’s account with orders for Other Clients. For example, and without limitation, CVC Capital Partners is primarily engaged in advising and managing private equity funds that currently acquire controlling or significant minority interests in European, Asian and North American companies by investing primarily in equity and equity linked securities. While these investments are generally not suitable for the Issuer, certain conflicts of interest may arise in situations in which investment vehicles advised or managed by the Collateral Manager, CVC Credit Partners and/or CVC Capital Partners have made investments in different parts of the capital structure of the same company. No assurances can be made that any conflicts will be resolved in favour of the Issuer’s interests.
CVC has adopted a conflicts mitigation policy (the “Conflicts Policy”), designed to help CVC identify and mitigate any potential conflicts of interest which may arise from investment or other activities. CVC has established a conflicts committee (the “Conflicts Committee”) comprised of members of its operating committee, its general counsel and its chief compliance officer. The Conflicts Committee is responsible for the review and approval of the Conflicts Policy and other conflicts policies and procedures as well as conflicts disclosure. The Conflicts Committee is also responsible for the review of new potential and existing material conflicts of interest. The Conflicts Committee may escalate matters to a committee of independent persons (the “External Conflicts Committee”) established to conducts reviews on behalf of and to provide guidance to CVC with respect to situations where there is the potential for (or an appearance or perception of) a material conflict of interest. There can be no assurance that CVC will resolve any conflict in a manner that is favourable to all clients or to any particular client such as the Issuer.
Any decision to purchase a primary credit investment or the initial purchase of a secondary credit investment in a CVC Capital Portfolio Company is reviewed by the Conflicts Committee. If such purchase would result in CVC holding in aggregate across all its clients 10% or more of the relevant investment tranche or class the investment will be referred to the External Conflicts Committee. Material corporate actions, e.g. amendments, re-leveraging, covenant waivers, or any restructuring, of a CVC Capital Portfolio Company are reviewed by CVC’s chief compliance officer, and if considered necessary, the Conflicts Committee. Corporate actions relating to CVC Capital Portfolio Companies in which CVC debt holding represents more than 10% of the relevant voting class are automatically be referred to the External Conflicts Committee, after having been reviewed by the relevant investment committee and the Conflicts Committee. If CVC Clients provide financing to portfolio companies of the private equity funds managed by CVC, the CVC Clients will typically participate on arm’s length terms no more favourable than the terms on which other similarly situated lenders.
The Collateral Manager and/or CVC Credit Partners may engage in transactions or investments or cause or advise Other Clients to engage in transactions or investments which may differ from or be identical to the transactions or investments engaged in by the Collateral Manager for the Issuer’s account without notifying the Issuer or the Noteholders. Such advice or transactions may be effected at prices or rates that are more or less favourable than the prices or rates applying to transactions effected for the Issuer and may affect the prices and availability of assets in which the Issuer invests or seeks to invest. The Collateral Manager and the Collateral Manager Related Persons do not have any obligation to engage in any transaction or investment for the Issuer’s account or to recommend any transaction to the Issuer which the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Manager Related Persons may engage in for their own accounts or the account of any Other Clients except as otherwise required by applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Manager Related Persons are permitted to bunch or aggregate orders for the Issuer’s account with orders for Other Clients.
CVC Credit Partners may purchase, sell or take other actions with respect to an investment for its own accounts or those of Other Clients, or suggest that such Other Clients make such purchase, sale or other actions prior to executing such actions for the Issuer in respect of such investment, and such actions by CVC Credit Partners may result in more or less favourable terms in connection with any subsequent action taken by or on behalf of the Issuer. Additionally CVC Credit Partners may vote and make any other determinations with respect to the investments held for its own accounts or those of its Other Clients in its sole discretion without regard to the manner in which it votes or makes any other determinations on behalf of the Issuer with respect to such investments, and such votes or determinations taken for CVC Credit Partners’ own accounts or those of its Other Clients may conflict with those votes or determinations taken on behalf of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager is under no obligation to disclose such votes or determinations to Noteholders.
Investments in which the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager Related Persons and CVC have a Different Interest

CVC may invest in a broad range of securities and instruments throughout the corporate capital structure. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager, through Collateral Debt Obligations, may invest in different parts of the capital structure of a company or other issuer in which CVC or Other Clients invest. Therefore, if Other Clients were to purchase debt or other instruments at a different level than the Issuer’s Collateral Debt Obligations, CVC may, in certain instances, face a conflict of interest in respect of the advice it gives to, and the actions it takes on behalf of, such Other Client and the Issuer.
For example, with respect to the Issuer’s investments in certain companies, Other Clients may invest in equity and/or different classes of debt issued by the same companies and/or one of CVC Capital Partners’ private equity funds may own some or all of the equity securities of such companies. For example, and without limitation, to the extent an investment vehicle advised or managed by CVC Capital Partners may own all or a majority of the outstanding equity securities of a company in which the Issuer invests, such funds may have the ability to elect all of the members of the board of directors of such company and thereby control its policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of common stock or other securities, the payments of dividends, if any, on its common stock, the incurrence of debt by it, amendments to its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and entering into extraordinary transactions, and such funds’ interests may not in all cases be aligned with the Issuer’s, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts.
Further, if Other Clients were to purchase debt or other instruments issued by a company at a different level in the company’s capital structure than the Issuer’s investments, CVC Credit Partners may, in certain instances, face a conflict of interest in respect of the advice it gives to, and the actions it takes on behalf of, such Other Client and the Issuer (e.g., with respect to the terms of such debt or other instruments, the enforcement of covenants, the terms of recapitalisations, exercise of rights, pursuit of remedies, etc.).
Other Clients could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition that would increase indebtedness, divestiture of revenue-generating assets or other transaction that could enhance the value of the private equity investment, even though the proposed transaction would subject the Issuer’s debt investments to additional or increased risk. In addition, to the extent that one of the Other Clients is actually or effectively the controlling shareholder, it may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of such company or a change in the composition of its board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of that company regardless as to whether it is in the interests of the Issuer. So long as the Other Client continues to own a significant amount of the voting power of a company in which the Issuer invests, even if such amount is less than 50%, it may continue to influence strongly, or effectively control, that company’s decisions. As a result, the CVC Fund’s interests with respect to the management, investment decisions or operations of those companies may at times be in direct conflict with those of the Other Clients.
In addition, where the Issuer, CVC Credit Partners and/or the Other Clients invest in different parts of the capital structure of a company, their respective interests may diverge significantly in the case of financial distress of the company. For example, if additional financing is necessary as a result of financial or other difficulties, it may not be in the best interests of the Issuer to provide such additional financing. If CVC or Other Clients were to lose their respective investments as a result of such difficulties, the ability of the Collateral Manager to recommend actions in the best interests of the Issuer might be impaired. In addition, it is possible that in a bankruptcy proceeding the Issuer’s interest may be subordinated or otherwise adversely affected by virtue of the Collateral Managers, the Collateral Manager Related Persons’ and/or CVC’s or the Other Client’s involvement and actions relating to their investment. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the term of or the return on the Issuer’s investment will be equivalent to or better than the term of or the returns obtained by the other Affiliates or the Other Clients participating in the transaction. This may result in a loss or substantial dilution of the Issuer’s investment, while CVC and/or an Other Client recovers all or part of amounts due to it.
A further example of where the Issuer, CVC and/or the Other Clients may have divergent interests where they are invested in different parts of the capital structure of a company is where such an entity is holding senior loans or debt securities of a company and may therefore want to pursue actions to protect its own rights as a creditor that are detrimental to the rights of an Other Client, CVC or the CVC Fund, that holds more junior securities issued by the same company.
The Collateral Manager’s ability to implement the Issuer’s strategies effectively may be limited to the extent that contractual obligations entered into in respect of the activities of CVC impose restrictions on the Issuer engaging in transactions that the Collateral Manager may be interested in otherwise pursuing.
Due to the various conflicts described herein, actions may be taken by CVC and/or on behalf of Other Clients that are adverse to the Issuer.
While the possibility of conflicts in such circumstances can never be fully mitigated, prior to making any new investment in a company on behalf of a client, CVC Credit Partners will consider whether the interests of other clients invested in the capital structure of the company may impair its ability to act in the best interest of the client in question. When CVC Credit Partners is required to take action with respect to a security or loan investment held by a client, it is CVC Credit Partners’ policy to act in the best interest of the holder of the investment with respect to which action is being taken, even though such actions may be to the detriment of others invested in the company’s capital structure.
Allocation of Opportunities; Non Exclusivity

No Collateral Manager Related Person is required to accord exclusivity or priority to the Issuer in the event of limited investment opportunities. Where there is a limited supply of an available opportunity, a Collateral Manager Related Person will allocate investment opportunities (including any related co- investment opportunities) in any manner deemed appropriate as determined in its sole discretion, taking into account considerations which may include, among other things, investment objectives, investment strategies, restrictions or other considerations deemed relevant by a Collateral Manager Related Persons. However, CVC Credit Partners cannot assure, and assumes no responsibility for, equality among all of their and their Affiliates’ accounts and clients and, as a result, investment opportunities that fall within the Issuer’s objective and/or strategy may be allocated in whole or in part, away from the Issuer.
CVC Credit Partners now and/or in the future advises or manages Other Clients having objectives similar to or the same as, in whole or in part, to those of the Issuer.
Cross Transactions and Principal Transactions

Cross transactions are transactions in which one client of CVC Credit Partners sells securities or other instruments to another client otherwise than through an unrelated broker-dealer. Cross transactions present potential conflicts of interest. One client could be advantaged to the detriment of another client in the event that the securities being exchanged are not priced in a manner that reflects their fair value.
The Collateral Management Agreement permits the Collateral Manager, in its discretion, to engage on behalf of the Issuer in (a) cross transactions between the Issuer and another client of the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Manager Related Persons provided it has reasonable grounds to believe that any such cross transaction is justified from the perspective of the Issuer and is consistent with the Issuer’s investment policies and (b) agency cross transactions effected through a broker-dealer affiliated with the Collateral Manager, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Collateral Management Agreement.
Principal transactions are transactions in which a client of CVC Credit Partners that is deemed to be more than 25% owned by CVC Credit Partners or certain affiliated entities buys securities or other instruments from, or sells securities or other instruments to, otherwise than through an unrelated broker-dealer. The Collateral Management Agreement also permits the Collateral Manager to engage on behalf of the Issuer in principal transactions, subject to procedures developed by the Collateral Manager to address conflicts of interest. Any cross transaction or principal transaction will be effected in accordance with CVC Credit Partners’ cross transaction and principal transaction policies and procedures which are designed to ensure that the transaction is in the best interest of each involved client, is consistent with CVC’s duty to seek best execution, and is executed at a fair price as determined in accordance with the pricing protocols provided for in CVC’s policies and procedures.
The Collateral Manager’s current procedures regarding principal transactions require that it obtain, prior to effecting any principal transaction, the consent of the board of directors of the Issuer or an independent third party appointed to review such transactions on behalf of the Issuer. All principal transactions and cross transactions are priced in accordance with the Collateral Manager’s cross trade policies.
Neither the Collateral Manager nor any Collateral Manager Related Person will be liable to the Issuer,
the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person for any loss incurred as a result of the actions taken by or recommended by the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach, gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts) or reckless disregard in the performance of its obligations thereunder. Subject to the above mentioned standard of conduct, the Collateral Manager, its shareholders, directors, officers, partners, members, managers, attorneys, advisers, agents, employees and each Collateral Manager Related Person will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer for any losses or liabilities, including legal or other expenses, relating to the issuance of the Notes, the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement, which will be payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payments and not arising as a result of breach arising from the bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach , gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts) (or in the case of any pecuniary sanctions to which the Collateral Manager may be become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation, negligence) or reckless disregard of the Collateral Manager.
Conflicts of Personnel and/or Directors

Although the professional personnel and/or directors of the Collateral Manager will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager deems necessary, CVC Credit Partners’ investment professionals will continue to work on other projects, including the Other Clients, and conflicts of interest may arise in allocating time, services or functions among such interested parties and the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager may have discussions with investors from time to time. The views expressed in such discussions may influence the composition of the portfolio, and there can be no assurance that (i) a holder would agree with any views expressed by other investors in such discussions, (ii) the views expressed by some investors will not be more influential than those of others, or (iii) modifications made to the portfolio as a result of such discussions will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Debt Obligations.
Conflicts of Service Providers

Certain advisers and other service providers, (including, without limitation, accountants, developers, property managers, administrators, depositaries, custodians, lenders, bankers, brokers, attorneys, consultants, investment or commercial banking firms and certain other advisers and agents) to the Issuer (including the Affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, delegates, contractors, officers and employees of such advisers and other service providers) may also provide goods or services to or have business, personal, political, financial or other relationships with Collateral Manager Related Persons, CVC or other service providers. Such advisers and service providers may be investors in the Issuer or Other Clients, the Collateral Manager, or their Affiliates. These service providers and their Affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, delegates, contractors, officers and employees may contract, otherwise be interested in or enter into any custodial, financial, banking, advising or brokerage, placement agency or other arrangement or transaction with the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or any Noteholder. These relationships may influence the Collateral Manager in deciding whether to select or recommend such a service provider to perform services for the Issuer (the cost of which generally will be borne directly or indirectly by the Issuer). Similarly, these service providers and their Affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, delegates, contractors, officers and employees may engage in competitive activities and may earn fees from or receive or provide other consideration from such persons or entities, and may provide different advice or services, take different action, or hold or deal in different loans for any other client or account, including their own accounts, from the advice or services they provide, action they take, or loans they hold or deal for the Issuer. In certain circumstances, advisers and service providers, or their Affiliates, directors, shareholders, agents, delegates, contractors, officers and employees, may charge different rates or have different arrangements for services provided to a Collateral Manager Related Person or CVC as compared to services provided to the Issuer, which may result in more favourable rates or arrangements than those payable by the Issuer.
Confidential Information

In connection with its other business activities and Other Clients, the Collateral Manager and Affiliates may come into possession of confidential, material non public information with respect to a borrower
(including, without limitation, due to its prior transactions with the borrower, through its participation in an official or unofficial steering committee or through third-party information sources) or another issuer, which may limit their ability to engage in potential transactions on behalf of the Issuer in certain circumstances. Should this occur, the Collateral Manager may also be restricted from providing all or a portion of their services to the Issuer until such time as the information becomes public or is no longer deemed confidential and/or material. Additionally, there may be circumstances in which one or more of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager will be precluded from providing services related to the Issuer’s activities because of certain confidential information available to such individuals, the Collateral Manager or Affiliates. In addition, the Issuer may not have access to material non public information in the possession of a Collateral Manager Related Persons which might be relevant to an investment decision to be made by the Issuer, and the Issuer may initiate a transaction to buy or sell a Collateral Debt Obligations which, if such information had been known to it, may not have been undertaken.
Policies and Procedures of CVC

Policies and procedures implemented by CVC Credit Partners from time to time (including as may be implemented in the future) to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements and contractual restrictions may reduce the synergies across CVC’s areas of operation or expertise that the Collateral Manager expects to draw on for purposes of pursuing and evaluating attractive investment opportunities for the Issuer. Because CVC has other activities beyond the Issuer, it is subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest, additional regulatory considerations and more legal and contractual restrictions than that to which it would otherwise be subject if it focused only on the Issuer. CVC has established an information barrier to isolate the material, non public information of each of CVC Capital Partners and CVC Credit Partners except as expressly provided in the information barrier procedures and subject to appropriate procedural safeguards. The purpose of this information barrier is, among other things, to confine any material, non public information obtained by personnel on one side of the barrier so that the investment activities of the businesses on the other side of the barrier are not restricted as a result of the material non public information being imputed to the personnel on the other side of the barrier. As a result of this information barrier, personnel of the Collateral Manager may not be able to use, act on or otherwise be aware of information that is known by or in the possession of the personnel of CVC Capital Partners (and vice-versa). Collaboration between CVC Credit Partners personnel and CVC Capital Partners personnel may therefore be limited, this in turn may reduce potential synergies. At the same time, there are no information barriers between or among the various investment teams within CVC Credit Partners, or between the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates. The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates operate a shared restricted list to which all of their respective clients are subject. Consequently, CVC Credit Partners may not be able to buy or sell a particular security or other instrument on behalf of its clients because one or more personnel of an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager possesses material, non public information concerning the instrument’s issuer or the market for the issuer’s securities or other instruments. Similarly, in such circumstances, CVC Credit Partners may not be able to dispose of a security or other instrument owned by a client, even in a declining market, until the information becomes publicly available or immaterial and the trading in the issuer’s securities or instruments is no longer restricted.
In addition, CVC may in the future establish or modify other information barriers between one division of CVC, on the one hand, and the rest of CVC on the other. Additionally, the terms of confidentiality or other agreements with or related to companies in which CVC has or has considered making an investment or which is otherwise an advisory client of CVC may restrict or otherwise limit the ability of the Issuer to make investments in or otherwise engage in businesses or activities competitive with such companies. CVC may enter into one or more strategic relationships in certain regions or with respect to certain types of investments that, although may be intended to provide greater opportunities for the Issuer, may require the Issuer to share such opportunities or otherwise limit the amount of an opportunity the Issuer can otherwise take.
Possible Future Activities

CVC may expand the range of services that it provides over time. Except as provided herein, CVC will not be restricted in the scope of its business or in the performance of any such services (whether now offered or undertaken in the future) even if such activities could give rise to conflicts of interest, and whether or not such conflicts are described herein. CVC has, and will continue to develop, relationships with a significant number of companies, financial sponsors and their senior managers, including
relationships with clients who may hold or may have held investments similar to those intended to be made by the Issuer. These clients may themselves represent appropriate investment opportunities for the Issuer or may compete with the Issuer for investment opportunities.
Additional Potential Conflicts

The officers, directors, members, managers and employees of CVC or may trade in loans and securities for their own accounts, subject to restrictions and reporting requirements as may be required by law and internal policies or otherwise determined from time to time by CVC. CVC may conduct any other business, including any business within the securities industry, whether or not such business is in competition with the Issuer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, CVC may act as the investment adviser or investment manager for others, may manage funds or capital for others, may have, make and maintain investments in their own name or through other entities, and may serve as officers, directors, consultants, partners or stockholders of one or more investment funds, partnerships, securities firms, advisory firms or management firms.
Rebates

The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, agree with one or more Noteholders to rebate a portion of its Collateral Management Fees. If any such agreement is made, the Collateral Manager will not be obliged to enter into similar agreements with or to notify other Noteholders. Such rebates may affect the incentives of the Collateral Manager in managing the Collateral Debt Obligations and may also affect the actions of the relevant Noteholders in taking any actions it may be permitted to take in respect of the Notes, including votes concerning amendments.
On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager will be reimbursed by the Issuer for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes and the negotiation and documentation of the Transaction Documents, including the Collateral Management Agreement (including legal fees and expenses).
Interest in the Notes

The Collateral Manager will act as the “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and will be required to satisfy the Originator Requirement (which will be satisfied if, on the Issue Date, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations that have been acquired by the Issuer from the Collateral Manager, divided by the Target Par Amount, is greater than or equal to five per cent.). The Collateral Manager, acting in its capacity as the Retention Holder, shall undertake to hold Class M-1 Subordinated Notes constituting the Retention Notes, and the Collateral Manager and/or Collateral Manager Related Persons may purchase other Notes on or after the Issue Date. Any Notes (including any Class of Rated Notes and Subordinated Notes) held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum and the results of, voting on any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution (other than, in the case of Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person, a CM Replacement Resolution in respect of the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager which is not Affiliated with the Collateral Manager and where the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager is not due to the Collateral Manager having been removed due to a Collateral Manager Event of Default in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Conditions).
Subject to the foregoing, there will be no restriction on the ability of Collateral Manager Related Persons to purchase Notes (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) and to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled (except that Notes held by the Collateral Manager, certain of its Affiliates and their respective employees shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights under certain circumstances as described in the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement). The interests of Collateral Manager Related Persons and other investors in the Notes may not be aligned and may create conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and other investors in the Notes. Moreover, such ownership of Notes by Collateral Manager Related Persons, the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee and the opportunity to earn an Incentive Collateral Management Fee could provide an incentive for the Collateral Manager to seek to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer at a lower price or to otherwise make riskier investments than would otherwise be the case.
5.2 Rating Agencies
S&P, Moody’s and KBRA have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).
5.3 Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger and their respective Affiliates
NATIXIS in its capacity as the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger and their respective Affiliates (the “Natixis Parties”) will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structure of the transaction and in other roles described below.
The Initial Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Initial Purchaser will purchase each Class of the Notes (other than the Retention Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes to be purchased by the Retention Holder and CVC Credit Partners Global CLO Management Limited, respectively) from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. NATIXIS may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Natixis Parties expect to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Natixis Parties may purchase and retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by the Natixis Parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market. The Natixis Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. In carrying out its obligations as Initial Purchaser or Arranger or any other transaction party, no Natixis Party shall be under any duty to disclose to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholders, prospective investor or any other person, any non-public information acquired in the course of carrying on any business for, or in connection with, the provision of services to any other party. The Natixis Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Debt Obligations. In addition, the Natixis Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Debt Obligations. Each of the Natixis Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the holders of the Notes or any other party including, without limitation, in deciding whether to enforce its security granted in connection with any financing. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors affiliated with the Natixis Parties or in which one or more Natixis Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Natixis Party’s own investments in such Obligors.
From time to time the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Debt Obligations through or to the Natixis Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and that one or more Natixis Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participation interests and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Natixis Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or collateral manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes. Prior to the Issue Date, one or more Natixis Parties are expected to be a Warehouse Provider for the acquisition of certain Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements.
The Natixis Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of
business, Natixis Parties and employees or customers of the Natixis Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to referencing the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Natixis Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Natixis Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Natixis Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.
By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.
6. RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER UNDER IRISH LAW
6.1 Lack of operating history
The Issuer is a recently incorporated designated activity company with limited liability under Irish law that has no prior operating history or revenues upon which may be used to evaluate its likely performance and the performance of the Notes.
6.2 Preferred creditors under Irish law and floating Charges
If the Issuer becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Issuer has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, the Noteholders (and other Secured Parties) may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company, such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) which have been approved by the relevant Irish courts. (See “Examinership” below).
The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.
Where the holder of the security has given notice to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.
In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company which are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.
The essence of a fixed charge is that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending
or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.
In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the monies standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.
Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security over the relevant charged assets would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.
Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:
(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;
(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up even if crystallised prior to the commencement of the winding- up;
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and
(e) they rank after fixed charges.
6.3 Examinership
Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court under Section 509 of the Companies Act.
The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.
During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.
In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders.
If an examiner were appointed in respect of the Issuer, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;
(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and
(d) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.
6.4 Irish taxation position of the Issuer
The Issuer has been advised that it should fall within the Irish regime for the taxation of qualifying companies as set out in Section 110. As a result, it is anticipated that the Issuer should be subject to Irish corporation tax only on its profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice, after deducting all of its revenue expenses (including interest payable to the Noteholders in respect of the Notes). If, for any reason, the Issuer is not or ceases to be such a ‘qualifying company’ for the purposes of Section 110, or for any other reason is not entitled to deduct all its revenue expenses for Irish tax purposes, the Issuer could be obliged to account for Irish tax in respect of profits for Irish tax purposes, which are in excess of profit calculated under generally accepted accounting practice. This could result in material tax being payable in Ireland which has not been contemplated in the cash flows in respect of the Notes issued to the Noteholders. In such circumstances, the Irish tax treatment of both the Issuer and payments by the Issuer in respect of the Notes could be adversely affected. In turn, this may therefore affect the return which the Noteholders receive on the Notes.
7. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c 6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Holder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. See “Forced Transfer” above.

(b) Title to the Registered Notes
Title to the Notes passes upon registration of transfers in the Register in accordance with the provisions of the Agency Agreement and the Trust Deed. Notes will be transferable only on the books of the Issuer and its agents. The registered holder of any Note will (except as otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any interest in it, any writing on it, or its theft or loss) and no person will be liable for so treating the holder.
Any interest in any Note represented by a Global Certificate shall be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of the relevant Clearing System.

In the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of any Note represented by any Definitive Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a further new Definitive Certificate in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred will be issued to the transferor.
The transfer of any Note, in whole or in part, represented by a Global Certificate shall be made in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of the relevant Clearing System.

Each new Definitive Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(c) (Transfer) will be available for delivery within five Business Days of receipt of such form of transfer or of surrender of an existing certificate upon partial redemption. Delivery of new Definitive Certificate(s) shall be made at the specified office of the Transfer Agent or of the Registrar, as the case may be, to whom delivery or surrender shall have been made or, at the option of the holder making such delivery or surrender as aforesaid and as specified in the form of transfer or otherwise in writing, shall be mailed by pre- paid first class post, at the risk of the holder entitled to the new Definitive Certificate, to such address as may be so specified.

(f) Closed Periods
No Noteholder may require the transfer of a Note to be registered (i) during the period of 15 calendar days ending on the due date for redemption (in full) of that Note or (ii) during the period of seven calendar days ending on (and including) any Record Date.
(g) Regulations Concerning Transfer and Registration
All transfers of Notes and entries on the Register will be made subject to the detailed regulations concerning the transfer of Notes scheduled to the Trust Deed, including without limitation, that a transfer of Notes in breach of certain of such regulations will result in such transfer being void ab initio. The regulations may be changed by the Issuer in any manner which is reasonably required by the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee) to reflect changes in legal or regulatory requirements or in any other manner which, in the opinion of the Issuer (subject to not less than 60 days’ notice of any such change having been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16
(Notices)), is not prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the relevant Class of Notes. A copy of the current regulations may be inspected at the offices of any Transfer Agent during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for the term of the Notes and will be sent by the Registrar to any Noteholder who so requests.
(h) Forced transfer of Rule 144A Notes
If the Issuer determines at any time that a holder of Rule 144A Notes (1) is a U.S. Person and (2) is not a QIB/QP (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Holder”), the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non- Permitted Holder demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder transfer its Notes outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or within the United States to a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such Non-Permitted Holder fails to effect the transfer within such 30 day period, (a) the Issuer shall cause such Notes to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a
U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Notes and selling such Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title to the Non-Permitted Holder by its acceptance of an interest in the Notes agrees to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and the Issuer shall not be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to submit a written certification substantiating that it is a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. If such holder fails to submit any such requested written certification on a timely basis, the Issuer has the right to assume that the holder of the Notes from whom such a certification is requested is not a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. Furthermore, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse to honour a transfer of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Note to any Person who is not either a non-U.S. Person or a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP.
(i) Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA
Each Noteholder (which, for the purposes of this Condition 2(i) (Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA) may include a nominee or beneficial owner of a Note) will agree to provide the Issuer and its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer. In the event the Noteholder fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of the Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any taxes to which the Issuer is subject under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges, and any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Noteholder as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate securities identifier in the Issuer’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.
(j) Forced transfer pursuant to ERISA
If any Noteholder is determined by the Issuer to be a Noteholder who has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction, Benefit Plan Investor, Controlling Person, Other Plan Law, Similar
Law or other ERISA representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading, or whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (any such Noteholder a “Non-Permitted ERISA Holder”), the Non-Permitted ERISA Holder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer, to the extent required to effect such transfers. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer. The Non-Permitted ERISA Holder will receive the balance, if any.

The Noteholders hereby authorise the Registrar, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA) and 2(j) (Forced transfer pursuant to ERISA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder. The Noteholders shall be bound by any actions taken by the Registrar, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Clearing Systems or any other party taken pursuant to the above-named Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer.
(l) Registrar authorisation
The Noteholders hereby authorise the Registrar, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA) and 2(j) (Forced transfer pursuant to ERISA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder.

The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may accept or reject any Contribution in its reasonable discretion. If a Contribution is accepted, it will be received into the Contributions Account and applied by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer (provided that, such application will not cause an EU Retention Deficiency) as directed by the Contributor at the time such Contribution is made or, if no direction is given by the Contributor, at the Collateral Manager’s reasonable discretion, provided in each case that such application is a Permitted Use in accordance with Condition 3(j)(viii) (Contributions Account). No Contribution or portion thereof will be returned to the Contributor at any time other than by operation of the Priorities of Payments.

(viii) Contributions Account
At any time during or after the Reinvestment Period, any Contributor may make a Contribution to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may accept or reject any Contribution in its reasonable discretion (and will notify the Trustee in writing of any such acceptance); provided that in the case of clause (ii) of the definition of “Contribution”, such notice must be provided no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date. Each accepted Contribution will be credited to the Contributions Account.
The Issuer will procure payment of Contributions standing to the credit of the Contributions Account (and shall ensure that payment of no other amount is made, save to the extent otherwise permitted above) out of the Contributions Account as directed by the Contributor at the time the relevant Contribution is made or, if no direction is given by the Contributor, at the Collateral Manager’s reasonable discretion, as follows:
(A) at any time, to the Principal Account for distribution on the next following Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments;
(B) at any time, at the direction of the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf), to the Interest Account for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payments;

(G) on any Payment Date, as directed by the Issuer in its discretion (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf), some or all of the Contributions to the payment of distributions on the Subordinated Notes in each case on a pro rata basis (determined upon redemption in full thereof by reference to the proportion that the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes held by Subordinated Noteholders bore to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to such redemption), provided that the cumulative aggregate amount of distributions paid pursuant to this paragraph (G) and paragraph (G) of Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account) may not at any time exceed the cumulative aggregate amount of Contributions made pursuant to Condition 2(m) (Contributions) at such time and provided further that on such Payment Date neither an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing or a Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
No Contribution or portion thereof accepted by the Collateral Manager will be returned to the Contributor at any time save for in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. All interest accrued on amounts standing to the credit of the Contributions Account will be transferred to the Interest Account for application as Interest Proceeds. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts standing to the credit of the Contributions Account pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition of “Contribution” will be deemed for all purposes as having been paid to the Contributor pursuant to the Priorities of Payments.

4. Security

(a) Security
Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes of each Class, the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Collateral Management Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (together with the obligations owed by the Issuer to the other Secured Parties) are secured in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties by:
(i) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights, title and interest (and all entitlements or other benefits relating thereto) in respect of all Collateral Debt Obligations, Exchanged Securities, Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations, Eligible Investments standing to the credit of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and any other investments (other than any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral), in each case held by the Issuer from time to time (where such rights are contractual rights (other than contractual rights the assignment of which would require the consent of a third party or the entry by the Trustee into an intercreditor agreement or deed) and where such contractual rights arise other than under securities), including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof;
(ii) a first fixed charge and first priority security interest granted over all the Issuer’s present and future rights, title and interest (and all entitlements or other benefits relating thereto) in respect of all Collateral Debt Obligations, Exchanged Securities, Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations, Eligible Investments standing to the credit of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and any other investments (other than any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral), in each case held by the Issuer (where such assets are securities or contractual rights not assigned by way of security pursuant to paragraph (i) above and which are capable of being the subject of a first fixed charge and first priority security interest), including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof;
(iii) a first fixed charge over all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of each of the Accounts and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of such Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and the debts represented thereby and including, without limitation, all interest accrued and other moneys received in respect thereof;
(iv) a first fixed charge and first priority security interest (where the applicable assets are securities) over, or an assignment by way of security (where the applicable rights are contractual obligations) of, all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account; including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof and over each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and the debts represented thereby including without limitation, all interest accrued and other monies received in respect thereof, subject, in each case to the rights of any Hedge Counterparty to the applicable Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement and these Conditions (and, in each case, subject to any prior ranking security interest entered into by the Issuer in relation thereto in favour of a Hedge Counterparty);
(v) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights against the Custodian under the Agency Agreement (to the extent it relates to the Custody Account) and a first fixed charge over all of the Issuer’s right, title and interest in and to the Custody
Account (including each cash account relating to the Custody Account) and any cash held therein and the debts represented thereby;
(vi) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under each Hedge Agreement and each Hedge Transaction entered into thereunder (including the Issuer’s rights under any guarantee or credit support annex entered into pursuant to any Hedge Agreement, provided that such assignment by way of security is without prejudice to, and after giving effect to, any contractual netting or set-off provision contained in the relevant Hedge Agreement and shall not in any way restrict the release of collateral granted thereunder in whole or in part at any time pursuant to the terms thereof);
(vii) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under the Collateral Management Agreement and all sums derived therefrom;
(viii) a first fixed charge over all moneys held from time to time by the Principal Paying Agent and any other Agent for payment of principal, interest or other amounts on the Notes (if any);
(ix) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under the Agency Agreement and the Subscription Agreement and all sums derived therefrom;
(x) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under the EU Retention Letter and all sums derived therefrom;
(xi) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under the Collateral Acquisition Agreements and all sums derived therefrom;

(xiv) a floating charge over the whole of the Issuer’s undertaking and assets to the extent that such undertaking and assets are not subject to any other security created pursuant to the Trust Deed,
excluding for the purpose of (i) to (xiv) above, (A) amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Profit Account and all monies from time to time standing to the credit thereof and the debts represented thereby, including all interest accrued and other monies received in respect thereof and (B) the rights of the Issuer under the Corporate Services Agreement.
The security created pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (xiv) above (inclusive) is granted to the Trustee for itself and as trustee for the other Secured Parties as continuing security for the payment of the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Trust Deed), provided that the security granted by the Issuer over any collateral provided to the Issuer pursuant to a Hedge Agreement will only be available to the Secured Parties (other than with respect to the collateral provided to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to such Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts)) when such collateral is expressed to be available to the Issuer in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement and the Conditions and (if a title transfer arrangement) to the extent that no equivalent amount is owed to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the relevant Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts).
The security will extend to the ultimate balance of obligations of the Issuer owed to the Secured Parties, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in part.
If, for any reason, the purported assignment by way of security of, and/or the grant of first fixed charge over, the property, assets, rights and/or benefits described above is found to be ineffective in respect of any such property, assets, rights and/or benefits (together, the “Affected Collateral”), the Issuer shall hold to the fullest extent permitted under Irish mandatory law the benefit of the Affected Collateral and any sums received in respect thereof or any security interest, guarantee or indemnity or undertaking of whatever nature given to secure such Affected Collateral (together, the “Trust
Collateral”) on trust for the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall (i) account to the Trustee for or otherwise apply all sums received in respect of such Trust Collateral as the Trustee may direct (provided that, subject to the Conditions and the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement, if no Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall be entitled to apply the benefit of such Trust Collateral and such sums in respect of such Trust Collateral received by it and held on trust under this paragraph without prior direction from the Trustee),
(ii) exercise any rights it may have in respect of the Trust Collateral at the direction of the Trustee and (iii) at its own cost take such action and execute such documents as the Trustee may in its sole discretion require.
The Issuer may from time to time grant security:
(i) by way of a first priority security interest to a Hedge Counterparty over:
(A) the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral deposited by such Hedge Counterparty in the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account related to such Hedge Counterparty including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof; and
(B) the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account related to such Hedge Counterparty, all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of such Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and the debts represented thereby including without limitation, all interest accrued and other monies received in respect thereof,
in each case, as security for the Issuer’s obligations to repay or redeem such Counterparty Downgrade Collateral pursuant to the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement and these Conditions (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between such third party, the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and the Trustee). For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may grant such security interest granted pursuant to a deed of charge directly to the relevant Hedge Counterparty; and/or
(ii) by way of first priority security interest over amounts representing all or part of the Unfunded Amount of any Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation and deposited in its name with a third party as security for any payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation including but not limited to reimbursement or indemnification obligation of the Issuer owed to any other lender under such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation, subject to the terms of Condition 3(j)(vii) (Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account) (including Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation).
All deeds, documents, assignments, instruments, bonds, notes, negotiable instruments, papers and any other instruments comprising, evidencing, representing and/or transferring the Portfolio will be deposited with or held by or on behalf of the Custodian until the security over such obligations is irrevocably discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed. In the event that the ratings of the Custodian are downgraded to below the Rating Requirement or withdrawn, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that a replacement Custodian with the Rating Requirement and who is appointed on substantially the same terms under the Agency Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed, the Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction in value of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure the Collateral and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held in a clearing system or in safe custody by the Custodian, a bank or other custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for ensuring that the Custodian, the Account Bank or any Hedge Counterparty satisfies the Rating Requirement applicable to it or, in the event of its failure to satisfy such Rating Requirement, to procure the appointment of a replacement custodian, account bank or hedge counterparty. The Trustee has no responsibility for the management of the Portfolio by the Collateral Manager or to supervise the administration of the Portfolio by the Collateral Administrator or by any other party and is entitled
to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without further enquiry and without liability. The Trust Deed also provides that the Trustee shall accept without investigation, requisition or objection such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
(b) Application of Proceeds upon Enforcement
The Trust Deed provides that the net proceeds of realisation of, or enforcement with respect to the security over, the Collateral constituted by the Trust Deed, shall be applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments set out in Condition 11 (Enforcement).
(c) Limited Recourse and Non-Petition
The obligations of the Issuer to pay amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties at any time shall be limited to the proceeds available at such time to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. If the net proceeds of realisation of the security constituted by the Trust Deed, upon enforcement thereof in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the provisions of the Trust Deed are less than the aggregate amount payable in such circumstances by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties (such negative amount being referred to herein as a “shortfall”), the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of each Class and its obligations to the other Secured Parties in such circumstances will be limited to such net proceeds, which shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. In such circumstances, the other assets of the Issuer (including the amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Profit Account and the Issuer’s rights under the Corporate Services Agreement) will not be available for payment of such shortfall which shall be borne by the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Subordinated Noteholders and the other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payments (applied in reverse order). The rights of the Secured Parties (including the Noteholders) to receive any further amounts in respect of such obligations shall be extinguished and none of the Noteholders of each Class or the other Secured Parties may take any further action to recover such amounts.
None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee or the other Secured Parties (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, examinership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
In addition none of the Noteholders or any of the other Secured Parties shall have any recourse against any Director, shareholder or officer of the Issuer in respect of any obligations, covenants or agreement entered into or made by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Conditions of the Notes or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party or any notice or documents which it is requested to deliver hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Trustee, the Directors, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Corporate Service Provider, the Liquidity Facility Provider nor any Agent has any obligation to any Noteholder of any Class for payment of any amount by the Issuer in respect of the Notes of any Class.
(d) Exercise of Rights in Respect of the Portfolio
Pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Issuer authorises the Collateral Manager, prior to enforcement of the security over the Collateral, to exercise all rights and remedies of the Issuer in its capacity as a holder of, or person beneficially entitled to, the Portfolio. In particular, the Collateral Manager is authorised, subject to any specific direction given by the Issuer, to attend and
vote at any meeting of holders of, or other persons interested or participating in, or entitled to the rights or benefits (or a part thereof) under, the Portfolio and to give any consent, waiver, indulgence, time or notification, make any declaration or agree any composition, compounding or other similar arrangement with respect to any obligations forming part of the Portfolio.
(e) Securitisation Regulation
The Issuer shall procure that a copy of each Monthly Report and any Payment Date Report is made available within two Business Days of publication, to each Noteholder of each Class upon request in writing therefor and that copies of each such Report are made available to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, each Hedge Counterparty, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Rating Agencies, any Competent Authority and potential investors in the Notes, within two Business Days of publication thereof. Following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports will be made available to, inter alios, the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and Competent Authorities in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Transaction Documents.
The Issuer hereby agrees to be designated as the entity required to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer will assume all costs of complying with the reporting requirements under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (including the properly incurred costs and expenses (including legal fees) of all parties incurred amending the Transaction Documents for this purpose) and, if applicable, shall reimburse each of the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Administrator for any such costs incurred by the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator in connection with their assisting the Issuer with the preparation and/or filing of such information and reports required pursuant to the provisions of the Securitisation Regulation, such costs to be paid as Administrative Expenses and/or Trustee Fees and Expenses, as applicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to provide such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In providing such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
(f) Filing of Charges
The Issuer shall ensure that particulars of the charges created under the Trust Deed are filed in the prescribed form at the Companies Registration Office of Ireland within the required 21 days from the date of the Trust Deed and, to the extent relevant, shall make a filing or procure that a filing is made pursuant to Section 1001 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 of Ireland.
5. Covenants of and Restrictions on the Issuer
(a) Covenants of the Issuer
Unless otherwise provided in the Trust Deed, the Issuer covenants to the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes that, for so long as any Note remains Outstanding, the Issuer will:
(i) take such steps as are reasonable to enforce all its rights:

(E) under the Corporate Services Agreement;
(F) under the Collateral Acquisition Agreements;

If, however, it is unable to do so, having used such endeavours, or if the maintenance of such listings are agreed by the Trustee to be unduly onerous and the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the holders of the Outstanding Notes of each Class would not thereby be materially prejudiced, the Issuer will instead use all reasonable endeavours promptly to obtain and thereafter to maintain a listing for such Notes on such other stock exchange(s) as it may (with the prior written approval of the Trustee) decide, provided that any such other stock exchange is (a) a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA and (b) a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of section 1005 of the United Kingdom Income Tax Act 2007;
(viii) supply such information to the Rating Agencies as they may reasonably request;

(x) ensure an agent is appointed to assist in enabling the Rating Agencies to comply with Rule 17g-5 in respect of the Issuer and the Notes; and
(xi) ensure that it shall hold all meetings of its board of Directors in Ireland and ensure that all of its directors are resident in Ireland for tax purposes, that they will exercise their control over the business of the Issuer independently and that those directors (acting independently) exercise their authority only from and within Ireland by taking all key decisions relating to the Issuer in Ireland.
(b) Restrictions on the Issuer
For so long as any of the Notes remain Outstanding, save as contemplated in the Transaction Documents, the Issuer covenants to the holders of such Outstanding Notes that (to the extent applicable) it will not, without the prior written consent of the Trustee:

6. Interest

(a) Payment Dates
(i) Rated Notes
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes each bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable:
(A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling on 18 December 2020; and
(B) thereafter:
(1) at any time prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, quarterly; and
(2) at any time following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, semi- annually,
in each case in arrear on each Payment Date.
(ii) Subordinated Notes
The Class M-2 Subordinated Notes bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable:
(A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling on 18 December 2020; and
(B) thereafter:
(1) at any time prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, quarterly; and
(2) at any time following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, semi- annually,
in each case in arrear on each Payment Date.
Residual distributions shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes to the extent funds are available in accordance with paragraph (BB) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph (R) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (X) of the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments on each Payment Date and shall continue to be payable in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) notwithstanding redemption in full of any Subordinated Note at its applicable Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the Trust Deed, all references herein and therein to the Subordinated Notes being redeemed in full or at their Principal Amount Outstanding shall be deemed to be amended to the extent required to ensure that a minimum of €1 principal amount of each such Class of Notes remains Outstanding at all times and any amounts which are to be applied in redemption of each such Class of Notes pursuant hereto which are in excess of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof minus €1, shall constitute interest payable in respect of such Notes and shall not be applied in redemption of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof, provided always however that such €1 principal shall no longer remain Outstanding and each such Class of Notes shall be redeemed in full on the date on which all of the Collateral securing the Notes has been realised and is to be finally distributed to the Noteholders.
If the aggregate of income and gains earned by the Issuer during an accounting period exceeds the costs and expenses accrued for that period, such excess shall accrue as additional interest on the Subordinated Notes but shall only be payable on any Payment Date following payment in full of amounts payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payments on such Payment Date.
(b) Interest Accrual
(i) Interest Accrual
Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, it shall continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder and
(B) the day following seven days after the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent has notified the Noteholders of such Class of Notes in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes of such Class up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Interest Amounts on the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes and distributions of interest and residual amounts on the Subordinated Notes will cease to be payable in respect of each Subordinated Note upon the date that all of the Collateral has been realised and no Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds remain available for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
(c) Deferral of Interest
(i) Deferred Interest
The Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated
Notes in full on any Payment Date, in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
In the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount which would, but for the first paragraph of this Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) otherwise be due and payable in respect of such Class of Notes on any Payment Date (each such amount being referred to as “Deferred Interest”) will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class of Notes.
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay such Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes or Class E Notes and the Priorities of Payments as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds will not constitute a Note Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date when such Notes are redeemed in full; unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: (i) following redemption in full of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; (ii) following redemption in full of the Class C Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and (iii) following redemption in full of the Class D Notes, the Issuer fails to pay any Interest Amounts in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable (in each case where such non payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission).
The failure to pay such Deferred Interest in the case of the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes shall not be a Note Event of Default unless and until such non-payment gives rise to a Note Event of Default under Condition 10(a)(iii) (Default under Priorities of Payments).
Interest will cease to accrue on each Note, or in the case of a partial repayment, on such part, from the date of repayment or the Maturity Date unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or unless default is otherwise made with respect to such payment of principal.
(ii) Non-payment of Interest
Non-payment of interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes shall not constitute a Note Event of Default unless a Frequency Switch Event has occurred and following the redemption in full of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with Condition 10(a)(i)(B) (Non-Payment of Interest).
(d) Payment of Deferred Interest
Deferred Interest in respect of any Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class M-2 Subordinated Note shall only become payable by the Issuer in accordance with, respectively, paragraph (M), (P), (S) and (V) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph (G), (I), (K) and (Q) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (L), (O), (R) and (T) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and under the Note Payment Sequence in each place specified in the Priorities of Payments, to the extent that Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, as applicable, are available to make such payment in accordance with the Priorities of Payments (and, if applicable, the Note Payment Sequence). For the avoidance of doubt, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes and/or the Class D Notes and/or the Class E Notes and/or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, as applicable will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes and/or the Class D Notes and/or the Class E Notes and/or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, as applicable. An amount equal to any such Deferred Interest so paid shall be subtracted from the principal amount of the Class C Notes and/or the Class D Notes and/or the Class E Notes and/or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, as applicable.
(e) Interest on the Notes
(i) Floating Rate of Interest
The rate of interest from time to time in respect of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class C Notes (the “Class C Floating Rate of Interest” ), in respect of the Class D Notes (the “Class D Floating Rate of Interest”) and in respect of the Class E Notes (the “Class E Floating Rate of Interest”) (and each a “Floating Rate of Interest”) will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:
(A) On each Interest Determination Date:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, the Calculation Agent will determine a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for 6 month and 12 month Euro deposits;
(2) prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine (i) the offered rate for 3-month Euro deposits and (ii) the offered rate for 6-month Euro deposits; and
(3) following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for 6-month Euro deposits or, in the case of the Accrual Period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls in September 2032, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for 3-month Euro deposits,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question (“EURIBOR”). Such offered rate will be that which appears on the display designated on the Bloomberg Screen “BTMM EU” Page (or such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying EURIBOR rates). The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (as defined below) and EURIBOR, all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(B) If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then paragraph (1) shall be applied, with any necessary consequential changes, to the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not so appear, or if the relevant page is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of four major banks in the Euro zone interbank market selected by the Issuer (the “Reference Banks”) to provide the Calculation Agent with:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, a straight line interpolation of its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market for a period of 6 months and 12 months;
(2) prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market for a period of (i) 3 months and (ii) 6 months;
(3) following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market for a period of (I) 6 months, provided that if a Frequency Switch Event occurs on a date which is not a Payment Date, the Calculation Agent will request such offered quotation for 6-month Euro deposits as at the Interest Determination Date immediately prior to the occurrence of such Frequency Switch Event for the Accrual Period in which the Frequency Switch Event occurred or (II) in
the case of the final Accrual Period, if the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date falls in September 2032, three months,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (if any) and the arithmetic mean, in each case, (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of such quotations (or of such of them, being at least two, as are so provided), all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(C) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides such quotation, the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest, respectively, for the next Accrual Period shall be the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest, in each case in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period, provided that in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date.
(D) Where “Applicable Margin” means:
(1) in the case of the Class A Notes, 1.95 per cent. per annum (the “Class A Margin”);
(2) in the case of the Class C Notes, 3.15 per cent. per annum (the “Class C Margin”);
(3) in the case of the Class D Notes, 5.34 per cent. per annum (the “Class D Margin”); and
(4) in the case of the Class E Notes, 7.08 per cent. per annum (the “Class E Margin”).
(E) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) above, if, in relation to any Interest Determination Date, EURIBOR in respect of any Rated Notes as determined in accordance with paragraphs (A), (B) (C) above would yield a EURIBOR rate less than zero, such EURIBOR rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of determining the Floating Rate of Interest pursuant to this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest).
(ii) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 am (Brussels time) on each Interest Determination Date, but in no event later than the Business Day after such date, determine the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and calculate the interest amount payable in respect of original principal amounts of the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The amount of interest (an “Interest Amount”) payable in respect of each Authorised Integral Amount applicable to any such Notes shall be calculated by applying the Class A Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class D Notes and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class E Notes, respectively, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of such Authorised Integral Amount,
multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned, divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
(iii) Determination of B Fixed Rate Interest Amounts
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 am (Brussels time) on each Interest Determination Date, but in no event later than the Business Day after such date, calculate the amount of interest (an “Interest Amount”) payable in respect of the Class B Notes for the relevant Accrual Period by applying the Class B Fixed Rate of Interest, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of the Class B Notes, multiplying the product by the number of days in the Accrual Period concerned (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 months of 30 days each), divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards), where:
“Class B Fixed Rate of Interest” means 2.90 per cent. per annum.
(iv) Reference Banks and Calculation Agent
The Issuer will procure that, so long as any Class A Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class M-2 Subordinated Note remains Outstanding:
(A) a Calculation Agent shall be appointed and maintained for the purposes of determining the interest rate and interest amount payable in respect of the Notes; and
(B) in the event that the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest are to be calculated by Reference Banks pursuant to paragraph (B) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), that the number of Reference Banks required pursuant to such paragraph (B) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) are appointed.
If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the purpose of calculating interest hereunder or fails duly to establish any Floating Rate of Interest for any Accrual Period, or to calculate the Interest Amount on any Class of Rated Notes, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the Trustee) appoint some other leading bank to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor having been so appointed.
(v) Interest Proceeds in respect of Subordinated Notes
Solely in respect of the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, the Calculation Agent will calculate:
(A) the amount of interest payable in accordance with paragraph (F) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments or paragraph (F) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable (a “Senior Class M-2 Interest Amount”); and
(B) the amount of interest payable in accordance with paragraph (V) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments or paragraph (T) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable (a “Subordinated Class M-2 Interest Amount” and together with the Senior Class M-2 Interest Amount, the “Interest Amount”),
and, in respect of an original principal amount of the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount for the relevant Accrual Period, being an amount equal to the product of:
(1) in the case of:
(a) the Senior Class M-2 Interest Amount, 0.0731 per cent.; and
(b) the Subordinated Class M-2 Interest Amount, 0.1096 per cent.,
in each case of the weighted average Aggregate Collateral Balance during the related Due Period, as determined by the Collateral Administrator; and
(2) the quotient of such Authorised Integral Amount divided by the aggregate original principal amount of the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes,
and multiplying such product by the number of days in the Due Period concerned (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 months of 30 days each), divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
Otherwise, with respect to the Subordinated Notes, the Calculation Agent will on each Determination Date calculate the Interest Proceeds payable to the extent of available funds in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The Interest Proceeds payable on each Payment Date in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of Interest Proceeds to be applied on the Subordinated Notes on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to paragraph (BB) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph (R) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (X) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments by fractions equal to the amount of such Authorised Integral Amount, as applicable, divided by the aggregate original principal amount of the Subordinated Notes.
(vi) Publication of Floating Rates of Interest, Interest Amounts and Deferred Interest
The Calculation Agent will cause the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Fixed Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest and the Class E Floating Rate of Interest or the Interest Amounts payable in respect of each Class of Rated Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, the amount of any Deferred Interest due but not paid on any Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class M- 2 Subordinated Notes for each Accrual Period and Payment Date and the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes as of the applicable Payment Date to be notified to the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market, as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter, and the Principal Paying Agent shall cause each such rate, amount and date to be notified to the Noteholders of each Class in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible following notification to the Principal Paying Agent but in no event later than the third Business Day after such notification. The Interest Amounts in respect of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes or the Payment Date in respect of any Class of Notes so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made with the consent of the Trustee by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Accrual Period. If any of the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default), interest shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) but no publication of the applicable Interest Amounts shall be made unless the Trustee so determines.
(f) Determination or Calculation by Trustee
If the Calculation Agent does not at any time for any reason so calculate the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Fixed Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest or the Class E Floating Rate of Interest for an Accrual Period, the Trustee (or a person appointed by it for the purpose) may do so and such determination or calculation shall be deemed to have been made by the Calculation Agent and shall be binding on the Noteholders. In doing so, the Trustee, or such person appointed by it, shall apply the foregoing provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), with any necessary consequential amendments, to the extent that, in its
opinion, it can do so, and in all other respects it shall do so in such manner as it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and reliance on such persons as it has appointed for such purpose. The Trustee shall have no liability to any person in connection with any determination or calculation (including with regard to the timelines thereof) it is required to make pursuant to this Condition 6(f) (Determination or Calculation by Trustee).
(g) Notifications, etc. to be Final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Calculation Agent or the Trustee, will be binding on the Issuer, the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and all Noteholders, save in the case that the Issuer certifies that any such notification, opinion, determination, certificate, quotation and decision is erroneous and the Issuer publishes a correction in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), provided that the Trustee shall be under no obligation actively to monitor any such notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions for such errors. No liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders of any Class shall attach to the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent or the Trustee in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 6 (Interest).
7. Redemption and Purchase
(a) Final Redemption
Save to the extent previously redeemed in full and cancelled, the Notes of each Class will be redeemed on the Maturity Date of such Notes. In the case of a redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption), the Rated Notes will be redeemed at their Redemption Price in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence and the Subordinated Notes will be redeemed at the amount equal to their share of the amounts of Principal Proceeds to be applied towards such redemption pursuant to paragraph (P) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments, together with, in the case of the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest and any Deferred Interest in respect thereof to the Maturity Date. Notes may not be redeemed other than in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) below on any Payment Date (or with the Collateral Manager’s consent, any Business Day) falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices). No such Optional Redemption may occur unless any Class of Rated Notes to be redeemed represents the entire Class of such Rated Notes.
(iii) Optional Redemption in Whole – Collateral Manager Clean-up Call
Subject to the provisions of Condition 7(b)(iv) (Terms and Conditions of an Optional Redemption) and Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing), the Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part by the Issuer, at the applicable Redemption Prices, from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period if, upon or at any time following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 20 per cent. of the Target Par Amount and if directed in writing by the Collateral Manager.
(iv) Terms and Conditions of an Optional Redemption In connection with any Optional Redemption:
(A) the Issuer shall procure that at least 10 days’ prior written notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Trustee and the Collateral Manager) of such Optional Redemption, including the applicable Redemption Date, and the relevant Redemption Price therefor, is given to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) (or if a period of less than 10 days has been agreed for the delivery of the Redemption Notices pursuant to Condition 7(b)(vii) (Mechanics of Redemption), the Issuer shall procure delivery of such notice as soon as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of such Optional Redemption);
(B) the Rated Notes to be redeemed shall be redeemed at their applicable Redemption Prices (subject, in the case of an Optional Redemption of all Classes of the Rated Notes in whole, to the right of holders of 100 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of any Class of Rated Notes to elect to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to the holders of such Class of Rated Notes). Such right shall be exercised by delivery by each holder of the relevant Class of Rated Notes of a written direction confirming such holder’s election to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to it, together with evidence of their holding to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager no later than 15 days (or such shorter period of time as may be agreed by the Trustee and the Collateral Manager, (with regard to the Collateral Manager only, acting reasonably)) prior to the relevant Redemption Date;
(C) the Collateral Manager shall have no right or other ability under the Collateral Management Agreement (but without prejudice to its rights in respect of any Subordinated Notes which it or its Affiliates may hold) to prevent an Optional Redemption directed by the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption);

(B) in the case of a redemption in part of the entire Class of Rated Notes issue replacement notes,
(each, a “Refinancing Obligation”), whose terms in each case will be negotiated by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer (any such refinancing, a “Refinancing”). The terms of any Refinancing (including any extension of the Maturity Date of the Subordinated Notes, any extension or reinstatement of the Non-Call Period and any extension to the Weighted Average Life Test, and any consequential amendments) are subject to the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager and the Subordinated Noteholders (notwithstanding Condition 14(b) (Decisions and Meetings of Noteholders) in relation to the Subordinated Noteholders only (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution)) and each Refinancing is required to satisfy the conditions described in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).
Refinancing Proceeds shall be applied in addition to (or in place of) Sale Proceeds in the redemption of the Rated Notes in whole pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders). In addition, Refinancing Proceeds may be applied in the redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part—Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders).
In connection with a Refinancing pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders), the Collateral Manager may designate Principal Proceeds as Interest Proceeds in an amount not to exceed the Excess Par Amount.

(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to the Rating Agencies and each Hedge Counterparty;
(2) all Principal Proceeds, all Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes save for the Subordinated Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payments (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments;
(3) all Principal Proceeds, Refinancing Proceeds, Sale Proceeds, if any, and other available funds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(4) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed;
(5) all Refinancing Proceeds and all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments, are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and

in each case, as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Collateral Manager (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely without enquiry and without liability).
(B) Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Part of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole
In the case of a Refinancing in relation to a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part—Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders), such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to the Rating Agencies and each Hedge Counterparty;
(2) the Refinancing Obligations are in the form of notes;
(3) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption;
(4) the sum of (A) the Refinancing Proceeds and (B) the Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds will be at least sufficient to pay in full:
(a) the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption; plus
(b) all accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses incurred in connection with such Refinancing;
(5) if the Partial Redemption Date is not otherwise a Payment Date, the Collateral Manager reasonably determines that Interest Proceeds will be available on the next following Payment Date in an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) the amount that will be required for distribution under the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments for the payment of all Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses on the next following Payment Date and (ii) the amount required for distribution under the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments as accrued and unpaid interest on the Rated Notes;
(6) the Refinancing Proceeds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(7) the Refinancing Proceeds and Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds are applied in accordance with the Partial Redemption Priority of Payments;
(8) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed;
(9) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Obligations in respect of each Class of Notes being redeemed is equal to the aggregate Principal
Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds and Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds;
(10) the maturity date of each class of Refinancing Obligation is the same as the Maturity Date of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds;
(11) the spread over EURIBOR of the Refinancing Obligations will not be greater than the spread over EURIBOR of the corresponding Class of Floating Rate Notes being refinanced (or, in the case of a Refinancing of a Class of Floating Rate Notes through the issuance of fixed rate Refinancing Obligations, the interest rate payable on the obligations providing the Refinancing will be less than the then-current interest rate payable on the corresponding Class of Notes being redeemed, in each case as of the date of the Refinancing); provided that the requirements above will not apply if: (i) the weighted average interest rate of the Refinancing Obligations (based on the aggregate principal amount of each class of such Refinancing Obligations) will not be greater than the weighted average interest rate of the Classes of Rated Notes being refinanced (based on the aggregate amount outstanding of each such Class); and (ii) a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P and a KBRA Confirmation is obtained;
(12) payments in respect of the Refinancing Obligations are subject to the Priorities of Payments and rank at the same priority pursuant to the Priorities of Payments as the relevant Class or Classes of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(13) the currency of denomination, the frequency of payment of interest and principal, voting rights, consent rights, redemption rights and all other rights of the Refinancing Obligations are the same as the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(14) all Refinancing Proceeds and Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and
(15) such Refinancing would not result in the transaction contemplated hereunder ceasing to be compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements,
in each case, as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Collateral Manager (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely without enquiry and without liability).
If, in relation to a proposed optional redemption of the Notes, any of the conditions specified in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the relevant redemption of the Notes and shall give written notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Such cancellation shall not constitute a Note Event of Default.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee shall be liable to any party, including the Subordinated Noteholders, for any failure to obtain a Refinancing, and any such failure shall not constitute a Note Event of Default.
(C) Consequential Amendments
Following a Refinancing, the Trustee shall agree to the modification of the Trust Deed to the extent which the Issuer certifies (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely without enquiry and without liability) is necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing (including any modification to remove the right of the
Subordinated Noteholders or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem the Refinancing Obligations issued in respect thereof by way of a further Refinancing), subject to as provided below. No further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Notes, other than from the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution subject always to the consent right of each Hedge Counterparty pursuant to Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).
The Trustee will not be obliged to enter into any modification that, in its sole opinion, (i) would have the effect of exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties or decreasing the rights, powers, indemnities or protections of the Trustee under the Transaction Documents, and the Trustee will be entitled to conclusively rely upon an officer’s certificate and/or opinion of counsel as to matters of law (which may be supported as to factual (including financial and capital markets) matters by any relevant certificates and other documents necessary or advisable in the judgment of counsel delivering such opinion of counsel) provided by the Issuer or any other party to the Transaction Document to the effect that such amendment meets the requirements specified above and is permitted under the Trust Deed without the consent of the holders of the Notes (except that such officer or counsel will have no obligation to certify or opine as to the sufficiency of the Refinancing Proceeds).
(vi) Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Notes effected through Liquidation only
Following receipt of notice from the Issuer or, as the case may be, of confirmation from the Principal Paying Agent of (i) a direction in writing from the required party or requisite percentage of Noteholders, as the case may be, in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders) or Condition 11 (Enforcement) 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Collateral Manager Clean-up Call), to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Collateral, the Collateral Administrator shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 10 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date (the “Redemption Determination Date”), provided that it has received such notice or confirmation at least 15 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, calculate the Redemption Threshold Amount in consultation with the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will be permitted to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations in the Portfolio where the Subordinated Noteholders exercise their right of early redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
The Notes shall not be optionally redeemed pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Notes effected through Liquidation only) where such Optional Redemption is to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Portfolio unless:
(A) prior to selling any Collateral Debt Obligations and/or Eligible Investments, the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry and without liability) that, in its judgment, the aggregate sum of (1) expected proceeds from the sale of Eligible Investments, and (2) for each Collateral Debt Obligation, the product of its Principal Balance and its Market Value, shall be at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount; and
(B) at least five Business Days before the scheduled Redemption Date, the Issuer shall have received proceeds of disposition of all or part of the Portfolio at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount.
Any certification delivered by the Collateral Manager pursuant to this section must include
(1) the prices of, and expected proceeds from, the sale (directly or by participation or other arrangement) of any Collateral Debt Obligations and/or Eligible Investments and (2) all
calculations required by this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) (as applicable). The Trustee shall rely upon such certification without further enquiry and without liability. Any Noteholder, the Collateral Manager or any of the Collateral Manager’s Affiliates shall have the right, subject to the same terms and conditions afforded to other bidders, to bid on Collateral Debt Obligations to be sold as part of an Optional Redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Notes effected through Liquidation only).
If conditions (A) and (B) above are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the redemption of the Notes and shall give written notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Such cancellation shall not constitute a Note Event of Default.
(vii) Mechanics of Redemption
Following calculation by the Collateral Administrator in consultation with the Collateral Manager of the relevant Redemption Threshold Amount, if applicable, the Collateral Administrator shall make such other calculations as it is required to make pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement and shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, each Hedge Counterparty and the Principal Paying Agent in writing.
Any exercise of a right of Optional Redemption by the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) shall be effected by delivery to the Principal Paying Agent by the requisite amount of Subordinated Noteholders or the requisite amount of Noteholders of the Controlling Class (as applicable) of the Notes held thereby together with duly completed Redemption Notices not less than 10 days’ prior written notice (or such shorter period of time as the Issuer and the Collateral Manager find reasonably acceptable prior to the proposed Redemption Date). No Redemption Notice and Subordinated Note or Notes comprising the Controlling Class so delivered may be withdrawn without the prior consent of the Issuer. The Principal Paying Agent shall copy each Redemption Notice received to each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and the Collateral Manager.
The Collateral Manager shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty, the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Principal Paying Agent in writing upon satisfaction of any of the conditions set out in this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and shall arrange for liquidation and/or realisation of the Portfolio in whole or in part as necessary, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement. The Issuer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the funds required for an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) in the Payment Account on the applicable Redemption Date (in the case of a Refinancing) or on the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date (in the case of a redemption by liquidation). Principal Proceeds and Interest Proceeds received in connection with a redemption in whole of all the Rated Notes shall be payable in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments. Refinancing Proceeds received in connection with a redemption in whole of a Class of Rated Notes (other than a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes) shall be paid to the holders of such Class of Notes to the extent required to redeem such Class of Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
(viii) Optional Redemption of Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.
(c) Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests
(i) Class A Notes and Class B Notes
If the Class A/B Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or if the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payments (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Tests are satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(ii) Class C Notes
If the Class C Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or if the Class C Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payments (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(iii) Class D Notes
If the Class D Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or if the Class D Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date and each Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payments (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(iv) Class E Notes
If the Class E Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payments (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until the Class E Par Value Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(v) Interest Diversion Test
If the Interest Diversion Test is not satisfied as of any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period only on the related Payment Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account, provided that such payment would not, in the determination of the Collateral Administrator (with such consultation with the Collateral Manager and the Retention Holder as the Collateral Administrator deems necessary), cause (or would not be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency, to be applied at the election of the Collateral Manager, for the purpose of the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations, or the redemption of the Rated Notes in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (U) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (T) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Interest Diversion Test to be satisfied as of such Payment Date
after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (U) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments.
(d) Special Redemption
A special redemption (“Special Redemption”) of the Notes may occur in the circumstances described below. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of a Special Redemption shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Collateral Manager shall be under no obligation to, or have any responsibility for, any Noteholder or any other person for the exercise or non-exercise (as applicable) of such Special Redemption.
Principal payments on the Notes shall be made in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments at the sole and absolute discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) if, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) that using reasonable endeavours it has been unable, for a period of 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its discretion and which meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account that are to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations. On the first Payment Date following the Due Period in which such notice is given (a “Special Redemption Date”), the funds in the Principal Account representing Principal Proceeds which, using reasonable endeavours, cannot be reinvested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations (the “Special Redemption Amount”) will be applied in accordance with paragraph (M) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Notice of payments pursuant to this Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption) shall be given by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) not less than three Business Days prior to the applicable Special Redemption Date to the Noteholders and to each Rating Agency. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of a Special Redemption shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Collateral Manager shall be under no obligation to, or have any responsibility for, any Noteholder or any other person for the exercise or non exercise (as applicable) of such Special Redemption.
(e) Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event
In the event that as at the Business Day prior to the Payment Date following the Effective Date, an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on such Payment Date and thereafter on each subsequent Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payments, in each case, until redeemed in full or, if earlier, until an Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing.
(f) Redemption following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period
Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Issuer shall, on each Payment Date occurring thereafter, apply Principal Proceeds transferred to the Payment Account immediately prior to the related Payment Date (save to the extent such amounts are designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement) in redemption of the Notes at their applicable Redemption Prices in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
(g) Redemption following Note Tax Event
Upon the occurrence of a Note Tax Event, the Issuer shall, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to cure such Note Tax Event in the least burdensome way to the Issuer (which may include changing the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would not give rise to a Note Tax Event). Upon the earlier of (a) the date upon which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) and notifies (or procures the notification of) the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) that it is not able to cure such Note Tax Event and (b) the date which is 90 days from the date upon which the Issuer first
becomes aware of such Note Tax Event (provided that such 90 day period shall be extended by a further 90 days in the event that during the former period the Issuer has notified (or procured the notification of) the Trustee in writing and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) that, based on advice received by it, it expects that it shall have cured such Note Tax Event by the end of the latter 90 day period), the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution or the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, may elect that the Notes of each Class are redeemed, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day thereafter, at their respective Redemption Prices in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in which case the Issuer shall so redeem the Notes on such terms, provided that such Note Tax Event would affect payment of principal or interest in respect of the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, the Subordinated Notes (in addition to any other Class of Notes) on such Payment Date; provided further that such redemption of the Notes, whether pursuant to the exercise of such option by the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, shall take place in accordance with the procedures set out in Condition 7(b)(vii) (Mechanics of Redemption).
(h) Redemption
Unless otherwise specified in this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), all Notes in respect of which any notice of redemption is given shall be redeemed on the Redemption Date at their applicable Redemption Prices and to the extent specified in such notice and in accordance with the requirements of this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).
(i) Cancellation and Purchase
All Notes redeemed in full by the Issuer will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.
No Note may be surrendered (including in connection with any abandonment, donation, gift, contribution or other event or circumstance) except for payment as provided herein, for cancellation pursuant to Condition 7(k) (Purchase of Rated Notes) below, for registration of transfer, exchange or redemption, or for replacement in connection with any Note mutilated, defaced or deemed lost or stolen.
In respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate cancellation of any Note required by the Conditions to be cancelled will be effected by reduction in the principal amount of the Notes on the Register, with a corresponding notation made on the applicable Global Certificate.
(j) Notice of Redemption
The Issuer shall procure that notice of any redemption in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) (which notice shall be irrevocable) is given promptly in writing to the Trustee, the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and the Rating Agencies.
(k) Purchase of Rated Notes
On any Payment Date, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement the Issuer may, subject to the conditions below, purchase any of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part), using Principal Proceeds standing to the credit of the Principal Account (other than Sale Proceeds in respect of the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, Credit Impaired Obligations or Interest Proceeds paid into the Principal Account pursuant to the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments), the Collateral Enhancement Account, any Deferred Senior Collateral Management Amounts or Deferred Subordinated Collateral Management Amounts and any amounts available to be applied towards Permitted Uses.
No purchase of Rated Notes by the Issuer may occur unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur in the following sequential order of priority: first, the Class A Notes until the Class A Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; second, the Class B Notes, until the Class B Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; third, the Class C Notes, until the Class C Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; fourth the Class D Notes, until the Class D Notes are redeemed or
purchased in full and cancelled; and fifth, the Class E Notes, until the Class E Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled;
(ii) (A) each such purchase of Rated Notes of any Class shall be made pursuant to an offer made to all holders of the Rated Notes of such Class, by notice to such holders, which notice shall specify the purchase price (as a percentage of par) at which such purchase will be effected, the maximum amount of Principal Proceeds and amounts standing to the credit of the Contributions Account that will be used to effect such purchase and the length of the period during which such offer will be open for acceptance;
(B) each such holder of a Rated Note shall have the right, but not the obligation, to accept such offer in accordance with its terms; and
(C) if the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes of the relevant Class held by holders who accept such offer exceeds the amount of Principal Proceeds specified in such offer, a portion of the Notes of each accepting holder shall be purchased pro rata based on the respective Principal Amount Outstanding held by each such holder subject to adjustment for Authorised Denominations if required;
(iii) each such purchase shall be effected only at prices discounted from par;
(iv) each such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period;

(vi) if Sale Proceeds are used to consummate any such purchase, either:
(A) each requirement or test, as the case may be, of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Test will be satisfied after giving effect to such purchase; or
(B) if any requirement or test, as the case may be, of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Test was not satisfied immediately prior to such purchase, such requirement or test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such purchase;
(vii) no Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(viii) such purchase shall not cause a breach of the applicable EU Retention and Transparency Requirements;
(ix) any Rated Notes to be purchased shall be surrendered to the Registrar for cancellation and may not be reissued or resold;
(x) each such purchase will otherwise be conducted in accordance with applicable law (including the laws of Ireland); and
(xi) the Issuer shall have given prior notice of such purchase to the Rating Agencies.
The Issuer shall surrender any purchased Rated Notes to the Registrar for cancellation and upon instruction by the Issuer, the Registrar shall cancel any such purchased Rated Notes surrendered to it for cancellation.
8. Payments
(a) Method of Payment
Payments of principal upon final redemption in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such Note at the
specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or any Paying Agent by wire transfer. Payments of interest on each Note and, prior to redemption in full thereof, principal in respect of each Note, will be made by wire transfer. Upon application of the holder to the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or any Paying Agent not less than five Business Days before the due date for any payment in respect of a Note, the payment may be made (in the case of any final payment of principal against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only of such final payment, endorsement) of such Note as provided above) by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, on the due date to a Euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in Western Europe.
Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate will be made to the registered holder as shall have been notified to the relevant Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) for such purpose and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the relevant Notes, upon surrender of such Global Certificate to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent. On each occasion on which a payment of interest (unless the Notes represented thereby do not bear interest) or principal is made in respect of the relevant Global Certificate, the Registrar shall note the same in the Register and cause the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by a Global Certificate to be decreased accordingly.
(b) Payments
All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation). No commission shall be charged to the Noteholders.
(c) Payments on Presentation Dates
A holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a Presentation Date and shall not, except as provided in Condition 6 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a Presentation Date falls after the due date.
If a Note is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones it is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.
(d) Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agents
The names of the initial Principal Paying Agent and the Transfer Agents and their initial specified offices are set out below. The Issuer reserves the right at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Principal Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent and appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will maintain a Principal Paying Agent, as approved in writing by the Trustee and shall procure that it shall at all times maintain a Custodian, Account Bank, Collateral Manager and Collateral Administrator. Notice of any change in any Agent or their specified offices or in the Collateral Manager or Collateral Administrator will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
9. Taxation

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within Ireland, or any political sub division or any authority therein or thereof or any other jurisdiction having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to gross up any payments made to Noteholders of any Class and shall withhold or deduct from any such payments any amounts on account of such tax where so required by law (including FATCA) or any such relevant taxing authority. Any such withholding or deduction shall not constitute a Note Event of Default under Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default).
Subject as provided below, if the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry and without liability) that it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes of any Class become obliged to withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax so that it would be unable to make payment of the full amount that would otherwise be due but for the imposition of such tax, the Issuer (save as provided below) shall use all reasonable endeavours to take such steps as are accessible to it as
will avoid such withholding or deduction (including by arranging for the substitution of a company incorporated in another jurisdiction as the principal obligor under the Notes of such Class, or to change its tax residence to another jurisdiction), subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in relation to such change and in accordance with the Trust Deed, provided that the Trustee’s approval shall be subject to confirmation of tax counsel (at the cost of the Issuer) that such a substitution and/or change in tax residence would be effective in eliminating the imposition of such tax.
Notwithstanding the above, if any taxes referred to in this Condition 9 (Taxation) arise:
(i) due to any present or former connection of any Noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Noteholder if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, or a corporation) with the jurisdiction in which the tax is imposed (including without limitation, such Noteholder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having had a permanent establishment therein) otherwise than by reason only of the holding of any Note or receiving principal or interest in respect thereof;
(ii) by reason of the failure by the relevant Noteholder to comply with any provisions of the Transaction Documents which set out applicable procedures required to establish non residence or other similar claim for exemption from such tax or to provide information concerning nationality, residency or connection with Ireland or other applicable taxing authority;
(iii) in connection with FATCA; or
(iv) any combination of the preceding clauses (i) through (iii) inclusive,
the requirement to take steps to avoid the withholding or deduction for or on account of those taxes shall not apply.
Any withholding or deduction required from amounts payable by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 9 (Taxation) shall be deemed to be included in the same paragraph in the Priorities of Payments as the paragraph which contains the payment in respect of which such withholding or deduction is required to be made.
10. Events of Default
(a) Note Events of Default

All amounts received in respect of this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default), shall be distributed two Business Days following the receipt by the Trustee of written notice from the Issuer confirming that the Issuer has received such amounts, in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.
Any previous rescission and annulment of a notice of acceleration pursuant to this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) shall not prevent the subsequent acceleration of the Notes if the Trustee, at its discretion or, as subsequently requested, accelerates the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) above or if the Notes are automatically accelerated in accordance with paragraph (b)(i) above.

(f) Collateral Manager Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute a “Collateral Manager Event of Default”:
(i) the Collateral Manager wilfully breaches, or wilfully takes any action that it knows violates any material provision of the Collateral Management Agreement or any other Transaction Document applicable to the Collateral Manager (it being understood that any action or failure to act by the Collateral Manager, including but not limited to any decision to buy or sell a Collateral Debt Obligation, based on its good faith interpretation (and where appropriate based on advice from legal counsel) of the Transaction Documents will not be considered a wilful breach or violation);
(ii) the Collateral Manager breaches any material provision of the Collateral Management Agreement or any terms of any other Transaction Document applicable to it that, either individually or in the aggregate, is or could reasonably be expected to be, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of any Class of Notes (excluding for purposes of this paragraph (ii) any actions referred to in paragraph (i) above) and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of, or receiving notice from the Issuer or the Trustee of, such breach or, if such breach is not capable of cure within 30 days, the Collateral Manager fails to cure such breach within the period in which a reasonably diligent person could cure such breach (but in no event more than 90 days);
(iii) certain bankruptcy events (excepting consolidation, amalgamation or merger) occur with respect to the Collateral Manager as described in the Collateral Management Agreement;

(v) any action is taken by the Collateral Manager or any of its senior executive officers involved in the management of any of the Collateral Debt Obligations, that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in connection with the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement;
(vi) the Collateral Manager is indicted, or any of its senior executive officers is convicted, of a criminal offence under the laws of any jurisdiction in which it conducts business, materially related to the Collateral Manager’s asset management business, unless, (A) in the case of a conviction of a senior executive officer of the Collateral Manager, such senior executive officer has, within 30 days after such occurrence, been removed from performing work in fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement, as the case may be, or (B) in the case of an indictment arising from practices that have become the subject of contemporaneous actions against multiple un-affiliated investment advisers in the same jurisdiction or regulatory region, such indictment has been cured or dismissed within 30 days; or
(vii) the Collateral Manager resigning pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement:
(A) following occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (vi) of the definition thereof the Collateral Manager may be removed by the Issuer at the direction of (i) the Controlling Class (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) or (ii) the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution) (in each case excluding (x) any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, CM Non-Voting Notes, and (y) those Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons) upon 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), the Hedge Counterparties and each Rating Agency;
(B) written notice shall be given in respect of the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default, by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), the Hedge Counterparties and each Rating Agency; and

Notwithstanding the above, no purported resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager shall be effective until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in the manner specified in the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Issuer acknowledges that the rights of the Controlling Class to participate in the selection or removal of the Collateral Manager following a Collateral Manager Event of Default, as described above, are the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default.
11. Enforcement
(a) Security Becoming Enforceable
Subject as provided in paragraph (b) below, the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral shall become enforceable from and including the time an Acceleration Notice is given or deemed to be given to the Issuer in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(b) Enforcement
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, but subject always to Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition) and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution, institute such proceedings or take any other action against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes and pursuant and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes, realise and/or otherwise liquidate or sell the Collateral in whole or in part and/or take such other action as may be permitted under applicable laws against any Obligor in respect of the Collateral and/or take any other action to enforce or realise the security over the Collateral in accordance with the Trust Deed (such actions together, “Enforcement Actions”), in each case without any liability as to the consequence of such action and without having regard (save to the extent provided in Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and conflicts of interest) to the effect of such action on individual Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party provided further that:
(i) no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless:
(A) (subject, in each case, to it being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), the Trustee (or an agent or other appointee on its behalf, including, without limitation, the Collateral Manager (an “Enforcement Agent”)) determines (subject to paragraph (ii) below) (in accordance with Condition 11(b)(iii) (Enforcement) below that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting and allowing for any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes) other than the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such amount the “Enforcement Threshold” and such determination being an “Enforcement Threshold Determination”), subject to consultation with the Collateral Manager; or

(2) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, the Noteholders of each Class of Rated Notes voting separately by Class by way of Ordinary Resolution direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action.
(ii) the Trustee shall not be bound to institute any Enforcement Action or take any other action unless it is directed to do so by the Controlling Class or, in the case of Condition 11(b)(i)(B)(2) (Enforcement) each Class of Rated Notes as applicable, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and, in each case, the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith. Following redemption and payment in full of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes, the Trustee shall (provided it is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby
become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) act upon the directions of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution; and
(iii) for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Portfolio, the anticipated proceeds to be realised from any Enforcement Action and whether the Enforcement Threshold will be met, the Trustee may appoint an independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor to advise it and may obtain and rely on an opinion and/or advice of such independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor (the cost of which shall be payable as Trustee Fees and Expenses).
The Trustee shall notify the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), the Issuer, the Agents, the Collateral Manager, each Hedge Counterparty and the Rating Agencies in the event that the Trustee or an Enforcement Agent on its behalf makes an Enforcement Threshold Determination at any time or the Trustee takes any Enforcement Action at any time (such notice an “Enforcement Notice”). Following the delivery of an Acceleration Notice which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) or, as the case may be following automatic acceleration of the Notes or pursuant to an Optional Redemption in whole in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds, Principal Proceeds and the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral and/or Swap Tax Credits (which are required to be paid or returned to a Hedge Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payments in accordance with the Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts)) or amounts standing to the credit of the Non-Euro Hedge Account which represent Sale Proceeds, prepayment proceeds or redemption proceeds in respect of Non-Euro Obligations, which in each case are required to be paid to the relevant Hedge Counterparty subject to and in accordance with the terms of an Asset Swap Transaction and the related Asset Swap Agreement and which shall be so paid or returned outside the Priorities of Payments), shall be credited to the Payment Account and shall be distributed in accordance with the following order of priority but in each case only to the extent that all payments of a higher priority have been made in full (the “Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments”):

In addition, any purchaser in any such sale which is a Noteholder may deliver Notes held by it in place of payment of the purchase price for such Collateral where the amount payable to such Noteholder in respect of such Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payments out of the net proceeds of such sale is equal to or exceeds the purchase moneys so payable.
12. Prescription

Claims in respect of principal and interest payable on redemption in full of the relevant Notes while the Notes are represented by a Definitive Certificate will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required by Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) within a period of five years, in the case of interest, and ten years, in the case of principal, from the date on which payment in respect of such Notes is received by the applicable Paying Agent.
Notwithstanding the above, claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate will become void unless presented for payment within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the date on which any payment first becomes due.
13. Replacement of Notes
If any Note is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of any Transfer Agent, subject in each case to all applicable laws and Euronext Dublin requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.
14. Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution
(a) Provisions in Trust Deed
The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders or any Class thereof (and of passing Written Resolutions) to consider matters affecting the interests of the Noteholders including, without limitation, modifying or waiving certain of the provisions of these Conditions and the substitution of the Issuer in certain circumstances. The provisions in this Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) are descriptive of the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed.
(b) Decisions and Meetings of Noteholders
(i) General
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing, in each case, in at least the minimum percentages specified in the table “Minimum Percentage Voting Requirements” in paragraph (iv) (Minimum Voting Rights) below. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.

The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects the holders of only one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes and not the holders of any other Notes as set forth in the tables below.
Notice of any Resolution passed by the Noteholders will be given by the Issuer to the Rating Agencies in writing.

The Issuer shall notify each Hedge Counterparty of any proposed amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents in accordance with the relevant Hedge Agreement and seek the consent of such Hedge Counterparty in respect thereof, in each case to the extent required in accordance with and subject to these Conditions and the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such notice shall only be given and such consent shall only be sought to the extent required in accordance with and subject to the terms of these Conditions and the relevant Hedge Agreement and, where such consent is sought, any such amendment shall only be made following the expiry of the notice.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall, subject to the following paragraph, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders (save where specified above) or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer, in making any modification, amendment, waiver or supplement pursuant to the paragraphs above (save for modifications, amendments, waivers or supplements in accordance with Conditions 14(c)(xii), 14(c)(xiii) and 14(c)(xiv) (Modification and Waiver)) to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer or the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee is required pursuant to the paragraphs above (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely without further enquiry and without liability) provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged to agree to any modification which, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the protections, rights, powers or indemnities of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents.

(d) Substitution
The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee to agree, subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed and such other conditions as the Trustee may require (without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class), to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes of each Class, if required for taxation purposes, provided that such substitution would not, in the opinion of the Trustee, be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, but subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation (subject to receipt of such information and/or opinions as the Rating Agencies may require), to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed, provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. Any substitution agreed by the Trustee pursuant to this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) shall be binding on the Noteholders, and shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may reasonably direct.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market any material amendments or modifications to the Conditions of the Notes, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to this Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to Euronext Dublin.
(e) Entitlement of the Trustee and conflicts of interest
In connection with the exercise of its trusts, powers, duties and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and conflicts of interest), the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of each Class of Noteholders as a Class and shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise for individual Noteholders of such Class and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 9 (Taxation).
In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificates are held on behalf of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to each Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of any Global Certificate.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of (i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class D
Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; and (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by principal amount of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater aggregate principal amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes.
In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person.
15. Indemnification of the Trustee
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving it from instituting proceedings to enforce repayment or to enforce the security constituted by or pursuant to the Trust Deed, unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document and any entity related to the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document without accounting for any profit. The Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction of value of the Collateral from any obligation to insure, or to monitor the provisions of any insurance arrangements in respect of, the Collateral (for the avoidance of doubt, under the Trust Deed the Trustee is under no such obligation) and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held by the Custodian or is otherwise held in safe custody by a bank or other custodian. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the performance by the Custodian of any of its duties under the Agency Agreement or for the performance by the Collateral Manager of any of its duties under the Collateral Management Agreement, for the performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties under the Collateral Management Agreement or for the performance by any other person appointed by the Issuer in relation to the Notes or by any other party to any Transaction Document. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for the administration, management or operation of the Collateral including the request by the Collateral Manager to release any of the Collateral from time to time.
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement of the Trustee and the removal of the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, but no such retirement or removal shall become effective until a successor trustee is appointed.
16. Notices
Notices to Noteholders will be valid if posted to the address of such Noteholder appearing in the Register at the time of publication of such notice by pre-paid, first class mail (or any other manner approved by the Trustee which may be by electronic transmission) and (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require) shall be sent to Euronext Dublin. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders (a) in the case of inland mail three days after the date of dispatch thereof,
(b) in the case of overseas mail, seven days after the dispatch thereof or, (c) in the case of electronic transmission, on the date of dispatch.
The Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Noteholders (or a category of them) if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the rules of the stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Noteholders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.
Notwithstanding the above, so long as any Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for delivery thereof as required by the Conditions of such Notes provided that such notice is also made to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin for so long as such Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require. Such notice will be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the date of delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system.
17. Additional Issuance

(a) The Issuer may, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, subject to the approval of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution and subject to the separate approval of both the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager and, in the case of the issuance of additional Class A Notes, the separate approval of the Class A Noteholders acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution, create and issue additional Notes having the same terms and conditions as existing Classes of Notes (subject as provided below) and which shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Outstanding Notes of such Class (unless otherwise provided), and will use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Debt Obligations, provided that the following conditions are met:

18. Third Party Rights
No person shall have any right to enforce any term or Condition of the Note under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
19. Governing Law

(a) Governing Law
The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law.
(b) Jurisdiction
The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non-contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process
The Issuer appoints Maples and Calder, London (having an office, at the date hereof, at 200 Aldersgate St, Barbican, London EC1A 4HD, England) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer does not have such agent in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes, after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account), are expected to be approximately €282,188,000.
Such proceeds will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer (together with any interest thereon), including pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date. The remaining proceeds shall be (a) used to fund the Interest Reserve Account in an amount equal to €1,000,000 and (b) after application of amounts in (a), in an amount retained in the Unused Proceeds Account.
FORM OF THE NOTES
The following description of the Notes which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such Notes. Capitalised terms used in this section and not defined in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in the Conditions.

References below to Notes and to the Global Certificates and the Definitive Certificates representing such Notes are to each respective Class of Notes, except as otherwise indicated.
Initial Issue of Notes
The Regulation S Notes of each Class (other than, the Retention Notes and in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and Subordinated Notes), including, where applicable, the CM Voting Notes, the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and the CM Non-Voting Notes of such Class, will be represented on issue by a Regulation S Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may not be held by a U.S. Person or U.S. Resident at any time. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. Person, and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest only to a person whom the seller reasonably believes (a) to be a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, or (b) to be a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Note. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes and Subordinated Notes), including, where applicable, the CM Voting Notes, the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and the CM Non-Voting Notes of such Class, will be represented on issue by a Rule 144A Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may only be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, amongst other things, that it is a QIB/QP and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
Beneficial interests in Global Certificates will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and as set forth in Regulation S and Rule 144A, and the Notes will bear the applicable legends regarding the restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”.
In the case of each Class of Notes, a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate in denominations greater than or equal to the minimum denominations applicable to interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Issuer of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) to the effect that the transferor reasonably believes that the transferee is a QIB/QP and that such transaction is in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificates may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Issuer of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) from the transferor to the effect that the transfer is being made to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction and in accordance with Regulation S.
Any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate and become an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate for as long as it remains such an interest. Any beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate and become an interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate for so long as it remains such an interest. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
Each initial investor and each transferee that is purchasing a Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. If an initial investor or transferee is unable to make such deemed representation, such initial investor or transferee may not acquire such Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate unless such initial investor or transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer (other than in the case of the Notes purchased by the Retention Holder); (ii) provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate)) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and
(iii) holds such Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate; provided that the Collateral Manager, Benefit Plan Investors and Controlling Persons that purchase such Notes on the Issue Date may hold such Notes in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate (or as otherwise permitted in writing by the Issuer). Any Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate shall be registered in the name of the holder thereof. The Retention Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes will be issued in definitive, certificated, fully registered form.
The Notes are not issuable in bearer form. Exchange for Definitive Certificates Exchange
Each Global Certificate will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Definitive Exchange
Date (as defined below), in whole but not in part, for Definitive Certificates if a Global Certificate is held (directly or indirectly) on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or an alternative clearing system and any such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces its intention to permanently cease business or does in fact do so.
In addition, interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes or Subordinated Notes may be exchangeable for interests in a Definitive Certificate representing Class E Notes or Subordinated Notes if a transferee is or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person provided: (i) such transferee has obtained the written consent of the Issuer (other than in the case of the Notes purchased by the Retention Holder) in respect of such transfer; and (ii) the transferee has provided the Issuer and the Transfer Agent with a certification substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate).
The Registrar will not register the transfer of, or exchange of interests in, a Global Certificate for Definitive Certificates during the period from (but excluding) the Record Date to (and including) the date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.
If only one of the Global Certificates (the “Exchanged Global Certificate”) becomes exchangeable for Definitive Certificates in accordance with the above paragraphs, transfers of Notes may not take place between, on the one hand, persons holding Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Exchanged Global Certificate and, on the other hand, persons wishing to purchase beneficial interests in the other Global Certificate.
“Definitive Exchange Date” means a day falling not less than 30 days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar and any Transfer Agent is located.
Delivery

In such circumstances, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any relevant Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Definitive Certificates and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of
simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under “Transfer Restrictions” below.
Legends

The holder of a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, may transfer the Notes represented thereby in whole or in part in the applicable minimum denomination by surrendering it at the specified office of the Registrar or any Transfer Agent, together with the completed form of transfer and to the extent applicable, written consent of the Issuer and a duly completed ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate)) to a Transfer Agent and the Issuer. Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, bearing the legend referred to under “Transfer Restrictions” below, or upon specific request for removal of the legend on a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, the Issuer will deliver only Definitive Certificates that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act.

Book Entry Ownership

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg

Each Regulation S Global Certificate and each Rule 144A Global Certificate will have an ISIN and a Common Code and will be registered in the name of, and deposited with, a nominee of the common depositary on behalf of, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. The Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any payment in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate, the common depositary by whom such Note is held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the relevant Participants’ or accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Certificate as shown on the records of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by Direct Participants in any Clearing System to owners of beneficial interests in any Global Certificate held through such Direct Participants in any Clearing System will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Save as aforesaid, such persons shall have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the Notes for so long as the Notes are represented by such Global Certificate and the obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the registered holder, as the case may be, of such Global Certificate in respect of each amount so paid. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to
or payments made on account of ownership interests in any Global Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such ownership interests.
Settlement and Transfer of Notes

Subject to the rules and procedures of each applicable Clearing System, purchases of Notes held within a Clearing System must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for such Notes on the Clearing System’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each such Note (the “Beneficial Owner”) will in turn be recorded on the Direct Participant and Indirect Participant’s records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from any Clearing System of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct Participant or Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Notes held within the Clearing System will be effected by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in such Notes, unless and until interests in any Global Certificate held within a Clearing System is exchanged for Definitive Certificates.
No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Notes held within such Clearing System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the Clearing Systems to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.

RATINGS OF THE NOTES

General
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Notes (except for the Subordinated Notes) be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s, “AAA(sf)” from KBRA and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B Notes: “Aa2(sf)” from Moody’s, “AA(sf)” from KBRA and “AA (sf)” from S&P; the Class C Notes: “A (sf)” from KBRA and “A (sf)” from S&P; the Class D Notes: “BBB-(sf)” from KBRA and “BBB-(sf)” from S&P, and the Class E Notes: “BB-(sf)” from KBRA and “BB-(sf)” from S&P. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.
A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.
Moody’s Ratings
Moody’s ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.
Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Debt Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, obligor and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Debt Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.
In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that they deem relevant.
S&P Ratings
The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes;
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and
(c) legal considerations.
Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the period beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the expiry of the Reinvestment Period.
S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”) which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Debt Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.
Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.
There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, or the Retention Holder, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.
S&P’s Ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.
KBRA Ratings
The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by KBRA address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by KBRA address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
KBRA’s process for analysing structured credit transactions broadly consists of the following five components:
(a) Collateral Analysis: KBRA will review the collateral in the portfolio and establish an assumption for the credit quality, industry / sector classification and recovery rate for each asset.
(b) Portfolio Level Analysis: Create a model portfolio based on the collateral limitations outlined in the transaction documents and then calculate the expected gross default rate of the portfolio at each rating level. The calculation of the portfolio’s expected default rates is based upon the evaluation of the portfolio’s credit quality and diversity, as derived from the collateral analysis performed. The expected gross default rates are then used as inputs in the cash flow analysis process.
(c) Transaction and Structure Analysis: Review the transactions documents to evaluate the transaction’s overall structure, including payment priorities, performance triggers, reinvestment provisions and events of default, amongst others. KBRA will also review the issuer to determine whether the risk of bankruptcy is sufficiently remote.
(d) Cash Flow Analysis: KBRA will use a cash flow model to test the resiliency of a transaction’s structure against varying interest rate vectors, default timing vectors, weighted average spread assumptions and recovery rate assumptions, amongst other factors. The results of the cash flow analysis will provide insight into the expected losses of each tranche under the various cash flow scenarios tested.
(e) Collateral Manager Review: As part of the rating process, KBRA performs an analysis of the collateral manager’s operations, experience and investment process, amongst other factors, to evaluate the manager’s ability to maintain the portfolio according to the transaction’s governing documents.
KBRA’s ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.
There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by KBRA in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by KBRA.

CVC Credit Partners
CVC Credit Partners combines what was Apidos Capital Management, LLC which was originally founded in 2005 as a subsidiary of Resource America, Inc and CVC Cordatus Group Ltd., (Europe), originally founded in 2006 by CVC Capital. In April 2012, the merger of these two entities created CVC Credit Partners L.P., a joint venture owned by CVC Capital (76%) and Resource America (24%). This merger significantly expanded the credit asset management platform of CVC into the US market and created a global presence in the leveraged finance asset class. The 24% interest in CVC Credit Partners L.P. was transferred by Resource America to C-III Capital Partners LLC in September 2016 as part of an acquisition of Resource America, Inc. CVC Credit Partners purchased the 24% interest from C-III Capital Partners LLC in August 2017. CVC Credit Partners has sought to differentiate itself via its investment performance, believes that it has generated attractive returns for investors in its investment vehicles and the existing team has, together, built a track record across both the US and European CLOs. As at 31 March 2020, CVC Credit Partners manages and advises in the leveraged finance asset class globally with approximately USD 25.51 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital across multiple investment vehicles spanning performing and non-performing credit.
As at 30 April 2020, CVC Credit Partners had a team of 64 investment professionals integrated across two offices in London and New York focused exclusively on investing in the sub-investment grade credit markets. Led by CVC Credit Partners’ Chairman, Hamish Buckland, and five partners, Gretchen L. Bergstresser, Tom Newberry, Mark DeNatale, Andrew Davies and Xavier Himmer, who combined have an average of approximately 30 years of professional experience, the senior members of the investment team have sourced, analysed, monitored and

THE RETENTION HOLDER AND EU RETENTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
The Issuer has accurately reproduced the information contained in the section entitled “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements—Description of the Retention Holder” from information provided to it by the Collateral Manager but it has not independently verified such information. So far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by the Collateral Manager, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. The information appearing in this section has been prepared by the Collateral Manager and has not been independently verified by the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any other party and none of such Persons assumes any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or applicability of such information.

Description of the Retention Holder
The Collateral Manager shall act as Retention Holder for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements as an “originator” (as such term is defined in the Securitisation Regulation as at the Issue Date). The description and the address of the Collateral Manager are set out in the “The Collateral Manager” section of this Offering Circular.
By way of background, the Securitisation Regulation definition of an “originator” refers to an entity which:
(a) itself or through related entities, directly or indirectly, was involved in the original agreement which created the obligations or potential obligations of the debtor or potential debtor giving rise to the exposures being securitised; or
(b) purchases third party exposures “on its own account” and then securitises them.
Article 3(4)(a) of the regulatory technical standards adopted by the EU Commission on 13 March 2014 provides that, where the securitised exposures are created by multiple originators (as is the case in a managed CLO, where assets are acquired from numerous sellers in the market), the EU Retention Requirements may be fulfilled in full by a single originator in circumstances where the relevant originator has established and is managing the scheme.
The Collateral Manager will represent and warrant in the EU Retention Letter that the Originator Requirement (as defined below) has been satisfied on the Issue Date and that the Collateral Manager has established and is managing the CLO described in this Offering Circular.
“Originator Requirement” means the requirement which will be satisfied if, on the Issue Date:
(a) the sum of the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations that are or have been subject to the Conditional Sale Agreement (as defined below); divided by
(b) the Target Par Amount,
is greater than or equal to five per cent.
On the basis of the paragraphs above, and the undertakings, representations, warranties and acknowledgements to be given by the Collateral Manager set out below, the Collateral Manager reasonably believes that it is an “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
Prospective investors should consider the discussion in “Risk Factors –Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Relating to the Collateral– Collateral Manager” above.
The EU Retention
The following description consists of a summary of certain provisions of the EU Retention Letter which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager will execute the EU Retention Letter addressed to the Issuer, the Trustee (for the benefit of the Noteholders), the Collateral Administrator, the Arranger and the Initial Purchaser.
Under the EU Retention Letter, the Collateral Manager acting through its Jersey branch in its capacity as Retention Holder will represent, warrant, undertake and agree on an ongoing basis so long as any Notes remain outstanding:
(a) to subscribe for and retain, on an ongoing basis and for its own account, a material net economic interest in Class M-1 Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount Outstanding equal to not less than 5 per cent. of the greater of (i) the Aggregate Collateral Balance and (ii) the Target Par Amount in accordance with Article 6(3)(d) of the Securitisation Regulation in force as at the Issue Date (the “Retention Notes”);
(b) that it and its Affiliates will not sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under or associated with the Retention Notes or the underlying portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations, unless expressly permitted by the EU Retention Requirements;
(c) to confirm its continued compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs (a) to (b) (inclusive) above:
(i) on a monthly basis to the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Arranger and the Initial Purchaser (concurrent with the delivery of each Monthly Report); and
(ii) upon any written request therefor by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Noteholder delivered following (1) a material change in (x) the performance of the Notes, (y) the risk characteristics of the Notes, or (z) the Collateral Debt Obligations and/or the Eligible Investments from time to time, or (2) the breach of any Transaction Document to which it is a party;
(d) that it will, promptly on becoming aware of the occurrence thereof, provide a written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Arranger and the Initial Purchaser of (i) any failure to hold the Retention Notes in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) above; and/or (ii) any representations in the EU Retention Letter or in paragraphs (g) to (j) below (inclusive) failing to be true on any date;
(e) subject to any applicable regulatory requirements, (i) to take such further reasonable action, provide such information, on a confidential basis, and enter into such other agreements as may reasonably be required to satisfy the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements as they apply as at the Issue Date and (ii) to provide to the Issuer, on a confidential basis, information in the possession of the Collateral Manager relating to its holding of the Retention Notes, at the cost and expense of the party seeking such information, and to the extent such information is not subject to a duty of confidentiality, at any time prior to maturity of the Notes;
(f) that in relation to every Originator Asset (as defined below), such asset is or will be subject to a Conditional Sale Agreement;
(g) that it has established and is managing the securitisation scheme consisting of the issuance by the Issuer of the Notes described in this Offering Circular and appointed the Initial Purchaser to provide certain specific services in order to assist with such establishment;
(h) that it is not an entity that has been established or that operates for the sole purpose of securitising exposures;
(i) that it has the capacity to meet a payment obligation from resources not related to the exposures it securitises; and
(j) that the Originator Requirement is satisfied on the Issue Date;
provided, however, that the Collateral Manager may transfer the Retention Notes only:
(i) to the extent such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements; and
(ii) if such transfer is to a Person which will commit to retain the Retention Notes subject to and in accordance with the EU Retention Requirements, such Person enters into an agreement on substantially the same terms as the EU Retention Letter,
and must notify the Noteholders of such transfer if the Collateral Manager would not retain the economic risk in the Retention Notes following such transfer.
Without limitation to the above, upon a resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement:
(A) subject to satisfaction of the requirements in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the Retention Notes may be transferred to the successor collateral manager on the basis that such successor collateral manager shall be the Retention Holder; or
(B) otherwise, the Collateral Manager shall remain the Retention Holder and bound by the retention undertakings described above, notwithstanding that it will no longer act as collateral manager with respect to the transaction described in this Offering Circular.
Origination of Collateral Debt Obligations

General

In relation to any asset acquired by it, the Retention Holder may from time to time:
(a) hold such asset to maturity;
(b) sell such asset to the market; or
(c) sell the asset to a CLO in respect of which it is the collateral manager, including the Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions described below.
Origination

The Collateral Manager may acquire assets for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of “originator” under the Securitisation Regulation which are intended to form part of the Collateral Debt Obligations (“Originator Assets”), pursuant to a conditional sale agreement (“Conditional Sale Agreement”) between the Collateral Manager (as purchaser) and the Issuer (as seller) under which the Issuer shall, in the event any such Originator Asset becomes ineligible to be a Collateral Debt Obligation (for example, if it does not satisfy certain conditions precedent on the relevant purchase effective date to the Issuer, including if such obligation becomes defaulted, credit impaired or otherwise does not satisfy the eligibility criteria pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements (if such purchase effective date falls prior to the Issue Date) or does not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria (if such purchase effective date falls on or after the Issue Date)) within 15 Business Days of the date upon which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Debt Obligation, have the right to require the Collateral Manager to purchase from it the relevant Originator Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Originator Asset. As a result, the Collateral Manager will be exposed to default and credit risk on such Originator Assets for the period between the purchase and the onward sale under the applicable Conditional Sale Agreement.
Comparable Assets

The Collateral Manager is aware of its obligations under Article 6(2) of the Securitisation Regulation and will not select assets to be transferred to the Issuer with the aim of rendering losses on the assets transferred to the Issuer higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on its balance sheet.
Credit Granting Criteria

The Collateral Manager is also aware of its obligations under Article 9 of the Securitisation Regulation and shall apply to exposures to be securitised the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting which it applies to non-securitised exposures. It has and will, as part of its due diligence on each asset to be securitised in respect of which it has not undertaken the original credit-granting, verify to the extent required pursuant to Article 9(3) that the entity directly or indirectly involved in the original agreement which created such asset, has applied to the asset the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting that such entity applies to its non-securitised exposures. Such verification has been and will be made by confirming that the original syndicate of lenders in respect of an Originator Asset has at least one credit institution that is subject to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (as the same may be amended from time to time).
Securitisation Regulation

Transparency Requirements

In accordance with Article 7(2) of the Securitisation Regulation, each of the originator, the sponsor and the Issuer are required to designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the reporting obligations of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer has agreed to be the designated entity.
The Collateral Manager will undertake, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, in a timely manner, to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Collateral Manager, reasonably required and in its possession and/or control in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the designated entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities, the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the assistance of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”). Following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports, data and other information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information available (or procure that such information is made available) via (A) a website currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Hedge Counterparties and as further notified by the Issuer to the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies to the Collateral Administrator (such certification to be in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager from time to time, such certificate may be given electronically and upon which certification the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is: (i) the Issuer, (ii) the Arranger, (iii) the Initial Purchaser, (iv) the Trustee, (v) a Hedge Counterparty, (vi) the Collateral Manager, (vii) the Retention Holder, (viii) the Liquidity Facility Provider, (ix) a Rating Agency, (x) a Noteholder, (xi) a potential investor in the Notes, (xii) a Competent Authority, (xiii) Intex or (xiv) Bloomberg and/or (B) such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation or a Competent Authority (as instructed by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager (or the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager) elects not the appoint the Collateral Administrator) in providing such reporting, the Issuer and the Collateral Manager shall appoint another entity to make such information available to any Competent Authority, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, neither the Collateral Administrator nor the Collateral Manager will assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager also assume no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation) and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.

THE PORTFOLIO
The following description of the Portfolio consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

Terms used and not otherwise defined herein or in this Offering Circular as specifically referenced herein shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions).
Introduction
Pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. Any delegation of duties by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement shall not relieve the Collateral Manager from any liability thereunder. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer, in each case to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.
Acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations
The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of primarily Senior Secured Loans, Senior Secured Bonds, Senior Unsecured Obligations, Corporate Rescue Loans, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds during the Initial Investment Period (including, but not limited to, Collateral Debt Obligations purchased pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements), the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least €260,000,000 which is approximately 92.5 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (as defined in the Conditions). The proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date, including repayment of the Warehouse Arrangements; and (b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes will be deposited in the Interest Reserve Account and the Unused Proceeds Account on the Issue Date. The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall use all reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account during the Initial Investment Period.
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests or the Interest Diversion Test prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 30 November 2020, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
On any Business Day falling after the Effective Date and up to (and including) the first Payment Date, the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account may be transferred to the Principal Account or the Interest Account, in each case, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, provided that as at such date: (i) the Issuer has acquired or entered into binding commitments to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Collateral Balance of which equals or exceeds the Reinvestment Target Par Amount (after taking into account any transfer in (ii) provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Collateral Balance, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (x) S&P Collateral Value and (y) Moody’s Collateral Value); (ii) an amount not exceeding 0.5 per cent. of the Target Par Amount may be transferred in aggregate (inclusive of any such amounts transferred from the Principal Account pursuant to paragraph (4) of Condition 3(j)(i) (Principal Account)) to the Interest Account,
(iii) (after giving effect to the transfer of such amount to the Principal Account or the Interest Account) the Class E Par Value Ratio is greater than the Effective Date Target Ratio, (iv) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests is satisfied and (v) the Class A Notes have not been downgraded by S&P or Moody’s below their ratings on the Issue Date and the S&P Rating or the Moody’s Rating (as applicable) of the Class A Notes is not withdrawn.
Within 15 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the “Effective Date Report”) containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether (i) the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded
to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Debt Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded (to the extent such repayments or prepayments are not subsequently reinvested) and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (a) S&P Collateral Value and (b) Moody’s Collateral Value) and (ii) the Aggregate Collateral Balance is equal to or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Collateral Balance, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (a) S&P Collateral Value and (b) Moody’s Collateral Value), and the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator an accountants’ certificate confirming the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at the Effective Date and the computations and results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests by reference to such Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes, provided that if the Effective Date Condition is satisfied then such rating confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from the Rating Agencies. If the Effective Date Condition is not satisfied within 30 Business Days following the Effective Date the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify the Rating Agencies. If (i) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure; (ii) either (A) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies or (B) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) presents a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies and Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan; or (iii) where the Effective Date Condition is not satisfied, following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation from the Rating Agencies is not received, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of any of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payments, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or any other intended action which will cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.

“Exchange Transaction” means the exchange of a debt obligation that is a Defaulted Obligation for another debt obligation that is a Defaulted Obligation, in each case which, but for the fact that such debt obligation is a Defaulted Obligation, would otherwise qualify as a Collateral Debt Obligation and (i) in the Collateral Manager’s commercially reasonable judgment, at the time of the exchange, such debt obligation received in exchange has a better likelihood of recovery than the Defaulted Obligation to be exchanged, (ii) as determined by the Collateral Manager, at the time of the exchange, the debt obligation received in exchange is no less senior in right of payment vis-à-vis the Obligor of such obligation’s other outstanding indebtedness than the Defaulted Obligation to be exchanged vis-à-vis its Obligor’s other outstanding indebtedness, (iii) as determined by the Collateral Manager, both prior to and after giving effect to such exchange, each of the Interest Coverage Tests is satisfied or, if any Interest Coverage Test was not satisfied prior to such exchange, the Interest Coverage Ratio relating to such test will be at least as close to being satisfied after giving effect to such exchange as it was before giving effect to such exchange, (iv) no more than one other Exchange Transaction has occurred during the Due Period during which such Exchange Transaction is occurring, (v) as determined by the Collateral Manager, both prior to and after giving effect to such exchange, an aggregate amount of not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance consists of obligations received in an Exchange Transaction, (vi) since the Issue Date, a cumulative aggregate amount of not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance consists of obligations received in an Exchange Transaction, (vii) the period for which the Issuer held the Defaulted Obligation to be exchanged will be included for all purposes in the Collateral Management Agreement when determining the period for which the Issuer holds the debt obligation received in exchange, (viii) such exchanged Defaulted Obligation was not itself acquired in an Exchange Transaction, (ix) the outstanding principal amount multiplied by the Moody’s Recovery Rate of the debt obligation to be received is equal to or better than the outstanding principal amount multiplied by the Moody’s Recovery Rate of the debt obligation to be exchanged, (x) no Restricted Trading Period is in effect at the time of the relevant exchange and (xi) the outstanding principal amount multiplied by the S&P Recovery Rate of the debt obligation to be received is equal to or better than the outstanding principal amount multiplied by the S&P Recovery Rate of the debt obligation to be exchanged.
Restructured Obligations
In the event a Collateral Debt Obligation becomes the subject of a restructuring whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Debt Obligation (including but not limited to an amendment of its maturity date) or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor, such obligation shall only constitute a Restructured Obligation if (i) it has an S&P Rating; and (ii) such obligation satisfies the Eligibility Criteria (save for paragraphs (c), (j), (o), (hh) or (ii) thereof) (the “Restructured Obligation Criteria”).
Management of the Portfolio

Overview

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is permitted, in certain circumstances and, subject to certain requirements, to sell Collateral Debt Obligations and Exchanged Securities and to reinvest the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Debt Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Collateral Manager) thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Manager shall determine (in consultation with the Collateral Administrator), as at the date of the proposed acquisition, that the Portfolio Profile Tests and Reinvestment Criteria which are required to be satisfied (or where such relevant criterion permits, maintained or improved) in connection with any such sale or reinvestment are satisfied (or where such relevant criterion permits, maintained or improved) or, if any such criteria are not satisfied (or where such relevant condition permits, maintained or improved), shall notify the Issuer of the reasons and the extent to which such criteria are not so satisfied (or where such relevant criterion permits, maintained or improved). Certification as of the trade date of the satisfaction of such tests (or where such relevant criterion permits, such tests are maintained or improved) shall be made upon delivery to the Collateral Administrator of a trade ticket by the Collateral Manager in respect of such acquisition on the settlement date thereof, and the Collateral Administrator in turn shall make the relevant certifications in the Issuer Order (as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement) on such date, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Collateral Manager will determine and use reasonable endeavours to cause to be purchased by the Issuer, Collateral Debt Obligations (including all Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations) taking into account the Eligibility Criteria and will monitor the performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations on an ongoing basis to the extent practicable using sources of information reasonably available to it and provided that the Collateral Manager shall not be responsible for determining whether or not the terms of any individual Collateral Debt Obligation have been observed.
The activities referred to below that the Collateral Manager may undertake on behalf of the Issuer are subject to the Issuer’s, monitoring of the performance of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement.
Sale of Collateral Debt Obligations

Sale of Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer shall sell any Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations which do not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date (each a “Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligation”) Any Sale Proceeds received in connection therewith may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria or credited to the Principal Account pending such reinvestment.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations

Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) subject to the following:
(a) to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge, no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing; and
(b) the Collateral Manager believes, in its reasonable judgement, that such security constitutes a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation, as the case may be,

Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Exchanged Securities

Any Exchanged Security may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) subject to, to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge, no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
In addition to any discretionary sale of Exchanged Securities as provided above, the Collateral Manager shall be required by the Issuer to use its reasonable efforts to sell (on behalf of the Issuer) any Exchanged Security which constitutes Margin Stock, as soon as practicable upon its receipt or upon its becoming Margin Stock (as applicable), provided that if the Collateral Manager is removed following the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default and a successor collateral manager has not been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Collateral Manager shall not sell any Exchanged Security.
Discretionary Sales

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may dispose of any Collateral Debt Obligation (other than a Credit Improved Obligation, a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation or an Exchanged Security, each of which may only be sold in the circumstances provided above) at any time provided that:
(a) no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing;
(b) no Restricted Trading Period is in effect and is continuing;
(c) following the Effective Date, after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding of all Collateral Debt Obligations sold as described in this paragraph during the preceding 12 calendar months (or, for the first 12 calendar months after the Issue Date, during the period commencing on the Issue Date) is not greater than 25 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of such 12 calendar month period (or as of the Issue Date, as the case may be); and
(d) either:
(i) during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager reasonably believes prior to such sale that it will be able to enter one or more binding commitments to reinvest all or a portion of the proceeds of such sale in one or more additional Collateral Debt Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding at least equal to the Principal Balance of such sold Collateral Debt Obligation or Collateral Debt Obligations within 45 days after the settlement of such sale in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria; or
(ii) at any time, either: (1) the Sale Proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the Principal Balance of such Collateral Debt Obligation; or (2) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) outstanding of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding the Collateral Debt Obligation being sold but including, without duplication, the Sale Proceeds of such sale) plus, without duplication, the amounts on deposit in the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (including Eligible Investments therein) will be greater than (or equal to) the Reinvestment Target Par Amount (as defined below),
provided that if the Collateral Manager is removed following the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default and a successor collateral manager has not been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Collateral Manager shall not sell any Collateral Debt Obligation.
Restricted Trading Period

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on its behalf) shall promptly notify Moody’s and S&P upon the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period.
Sale of Collateral Prior to Maturity Date

In the event of: (i) any redemption of the Rated Notes in whole prior to the Maturity Date; or (ii) receipt of notification from the Trustee of enforcement of the security over the Collateral; the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) will (at the direction of the Trustee following the enforcement of such security), as far as practicable, arrange for liquidation of the Collateral in order to procure that the proceeds thereof are in immediately available funds by the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date and sell all or part of the Portfolio, as applicable, in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and clause 27 (Realisation of Collateral) of the Collateral Management Agreement but without regard to the limitations set out in clause 20
(Management of the Portfolio) and schedule 4 (Reinvestment Criteria) of the Collateral Management Agreement (which will include any limitations or restrictions set out in the Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed).
Sale of Assets which do not Constitute Collateral Debt Obligations

In the event that an asset did not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the date it was required to do so in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall use reasonable efforts to sell such asset. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
Disposal of Unsaleable Assets

Following the delivery of prior written notice of a proposed Optional Redemption in accordance with Condition 7(b)(iv)(A) (Terms and conditions of an Optional Redemption), or the delivery of an Acceleration Notice (actual or deemed) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may conduct an auction of Unsaleable Assets. The Issuer will provide notice (in such form as is prepared by the Collateral Manager) to the Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions (and, for so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding, the Rating Agencies) of such auction, setting forth in reasonable detail a description of each Unsaleable Asset and the following auction procedures:
(a) any Noteholder may submit a written bid to purchase for cash one or more Unsaleable Assets no later than the date specified in the auction notice (which shall be at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice) and, for any Unsaleable Asset for which one or more bids are received, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, will deliver such Unsaleable Asset to the highest bidder against payment in cash of the bid price;
(b) each bid must include an offer to purchase for a specified amount of cash on a proposed settlement date no later than 20 Business Days after the date of the auction notice;
(c) if no Noteholder submits such a bid for an Unsaleable Asset, unless delivery in kind is not legally permissible or commercially practicable, the Collateral Manager will direct the Issuer to notify, and the Issuer will notify each Noteholder in accordance with the Conditions of the offer to deliver (at no cost to the Noteholders, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee) a pro rata portion of each unsold Unsaleable Asset to the Noteholders of the most senior Class that provide delivery instructions to the Collateral Manager on or before the date specified in such notice, subject to minimum denominations. To the extent that minimum denominations do not permit a pro rata distribution, the Collateral Manager will identify and distribute the Unsaleable Assets on a pro rata basis to the extent possible and the Collateral Manager will select by lottery the Noteholder to whom the remaining portion will be delivered. The Collateral Manager will use reasonable efforts to effect delivery of such portions of unsold Unsaleable Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, any such delivery to the Noteholders will not operate to reduce the Principal Amount Outstanding of the related Notes held by such Noteholders; and
(d) if no such Noteholder provides delivery instructions to the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will take such action (if any) to dispose of the Unsaleable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means.
Reinvestment of Collateral Debt Obligations

“Reinvestment Criteria” means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under “During the Reinvestment Period” below and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. The Reinvestment Criteria shall not apply prior to the Effective Date or in the case of a Collateral Debt Obligation which has been restructured where such restructuring has become binding on the holders thereof.
For the purposes of determining satisfaction of the Reinvestment Criteria:
(a) no portion of the balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account shall be taken into account when determining the level of compliance or non-compliance with any Portfolio Profile Test or Collateral Quality Test to the extent such portion has been or is to be designated as Interest Proceeds; and
(b) such determination shall be made, firstly, by reference immediately prior to receipt of any Principal Proceeds which are to be reinvested without taking into account and, secondly, taking into account on a projected basis, the proposed sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and reinvestment of the Sale Proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations.
During the Reinvestment Period

During the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall, using all reasonable endeavours, reinvest any Principal Proceeds in the purchase of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria provided that immediately after entering into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Debt Obligation and taking into account existing commitments, the criteria set out below, must be satisfied:
(a) no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(b) on and after the Effective Date (or in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if (other than with respect to the reinvestment of any proceeds received upon the sale of, or as a recovery on, any Defaulted Obligation, in respect of which such proceeds may only be reinvested if the Coverage Tests will be satisfied immediately following such reinvestment) as calculated immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation, the Principal Proceeds of which are being reinvested, any Coverage Test was not satisfied, the coverage ratio relating to such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment than it was immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;

(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance immediately prior to the sale of the relevant Credit Improved Obligation; or
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Debt Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Debt Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to

Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, only Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations (with the exception of principal proceeds received both before and after the Reinvestment Period in connection with the acceptance of an Offer where such Offer is by way of novation or substitution, where such principal proceeds will be reinvested automatically as consideration for the novated or substituted Collateral Debt Obligation (which shall not be required to satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria or the Eligibility Criteria but shall be subject to the Restructured Obligation Criteria being satisfied)) may be reinvested by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in one or more Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, in each case provided that:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations equals or exceeds (i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the related Collateral Debt Obligations that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds or (ii) the amount of Sale Proceeds of such Credit Impaired Obligation, as the case may be;

(c) if (i) the Weighted Average Life Test was satisfied on the last Business Day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test shall be satisfied or maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment, when compared to the results of such measurement immediately prior to the relevant sales or prepayments (in whole or in part); or (ii) if the Weighted Average Life Test was not satisfied on the last Business Day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test shall be satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(d) either: (I) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests (except the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Weighted Average Life Test and the S&P CDO Monitor Test) are satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (II) if any such test was not satisfied immediately prior to such reinvestment, such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment as compared to immediately prior to such sale, repayment or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;
(e) no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such reinvestment;
(f) each Coverage Test is satisfied immediately prior to and after giving effect to such reinvestment;

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above, by the later of (x) 30 days, and (y) the Determination Date occurring after receipt of such proceeds, shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payment on the following Payment Date (subject as provided at the end of this paragraph), save that the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria are not satisfied as of the Payment Date next following receipt of such Sale
Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, all such funds shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments.
Amendments to Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturities of Collateral Debt Obligations

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment:
(a) the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity Date of the Rated Notes provided that up to 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may consist of Long-Dated Collateral Debt Obligations;

Expiry of the Reinvestment Criteria Certification

Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Debt Obligations.
Interest Diversion Test

If, on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period only, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (T) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, the Class E Par Value Ratio is less than 111.04 per cent., Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds in an amount equal to the Required Diversion Amount,
(i) to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations, provided that such payment would not, in the determination of the Collateral Administrator (with such consultation with the Collateral Manager and the Retention Holder as the Collateral Administrator deems necessary), cause (or would not be likely to cause) an EU Retention Deficiency, or (ii) in redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence.
Designation for Reinvestment

After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Collateral Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Collateral Management Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Debt Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (i) Purchased Accrued Interest; (ii) any interest received in respect of any Mezzanine Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Deferring Mezzanine Obligation other than Defaulted Mezzanine Excess Amounts; and
(iii) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.
Accrued Interest

Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Debt Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute Purchased Accrued Interest and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
Block Trades

The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations on any day in the event that such Collateral Debt Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather on an individual basis; provided that at all times the Eligibility Criteria shall apply than on an individual basis.
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria at the election of the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Debt Obligation or a group of Collateral Debt Obligations) identified by the Collateral Manager as such at the time (the “Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date”) when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a “Trading Plan”) may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the twenty Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the “Trading Plan Period”); provided that:
(a) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period;
(b) no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date;
(c) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period;
(d) the Issuer shall give notice to each Rating Agency following any failure of a Trading Plan;
(e) the Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, elect to end any Trading Plan Period on a day which is earlier than 20 Business Days after its commencement;
(f) no Trading Plan may be entered into if any of the Collateral Debt Obligations which form part of such Trading Plan have a remaining Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity shorter than 6 months; and
(g) following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, no Trading Plan may be entered into if the differential between the shortest and longest maturity of the related Collateral Debt Obligations to be purchased under such Trading Plan is greater than 3 years,
provided that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Debt Obligation or Collateral Debt Obligations.
Eligible Investments

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account and the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.
Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time purchase Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Debt Obligations being so purchased.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time. Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payments rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.
Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations may be sold at any time and all Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments.
Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Interest Diversion Test.
Exercise of Warrants and Options

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may at any time exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Debt Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligation and shall request the Collateral Administrator to instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment in accordance with this agreement.
Margin Stock

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell any Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Security or Collateral Enhancement Debt Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.
Non-Euro Obligations

The Collateral Manager shall be authorised to purchase, on behalf of the Issuer, Non-Euro Obligations from time to time provided that any such Non-Euro Obligation shall only constitute a Collateral Debt Obligation that satisfies paragraph (b) of the Eligibility Criteria if either (a) for any Non-Euro Obligation denominated in a Qualifying Unhedged Obligation Currency within 90 days of the settlement date of acquisition thereof or otherwise (b) not later than the settlement date of acquisition thereof, the Collateral Manager procures entry by the Issuer into an Asset Swap Transaction pursuant to which the currency risk arising from receipt of cash flows from such Non- Euro Obligations, including interest and principal payments, is hedged through the swapping of such cash flows for Euro payments to be made by an Asset Swap Counterparty. The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) shall be authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Asset Swap Transaction. Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in relation to entry into each Asset Swap Transaction unless such Asset Swap Transaction is a Form Approved Asset Swap.
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire Collateral Debt Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euros) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.
Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee or other ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof in the event of any default by the obligor thereof in
respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder. Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations. To the extent required and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a third party from time to time as collateral for any reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt of an Issuer Order (as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement) the Trustee shall be deemed to have released such amounts from the security granted thereover pursuant to the Trust Deed.
Participations

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Debt Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:
(a) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution to such third party will not exceed the individual and aggregate percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party (or any guarantor thereof); and
(b) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions (or any guarantor thereof) having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating, and for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation.
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a sub-participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of:
(a) the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);
(b) the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or
(c) such other documentation provided such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as contained in the Trust Deed.
Assignments

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Debt Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Assignment is acquired the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Debt Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
Bivariate Risk Table
The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) and as referred to in “Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests” below and “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligation that are Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the Moody’s or S&P ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.

Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests

Measurement of Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Determination Date.
Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to purchase such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations but such purchase has not been settled shall nonetheless be deemed to have been purchased for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests and Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to sell such Collateral Debt Obligations but such sale has not been settled shall nonetheless be deemed to have been sold for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Test. See “Reinvestment of Collateral Debt Obligations” above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio to meet the requirements of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Debt Obligation from being a Collateral Debt Obligation.

(ii) the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, each as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Principal Balance of Defaulted Obligations shall be excluded for the purposes of calculating the Collateral Quality Tests.
Moody’s Test Matrix

Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set forth in the matrix to be set out in the Collateral Management Agreement (substantially in the form set out below) (the “Moody’s Test Matrix”) shall be applicable for purposes of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. For any given case:
(a) the applicable column for performing the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in which the elected case is set out;
(b) the applicable row and column for performing the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the row and column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable) in which the elected case is set out; and
(c) the applicable row for performing the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows, as applicable) in which the elected test is set out.
On the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will be required to elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter, on ten Business Days’ notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and Moody’s, the Collateral Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test applicable to the case to which the Collateral Manager desires to change are satisfied (and, in relation to the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, taking into account the case that the Collateral Manager has elected to apply under the S&P Test Matrix) or, in the case of any tests that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Collateral Manager be obliged to elect to have a different case apply.

The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test

The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Determination Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Debt Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows:
(a) an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;
(b) an “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Debt Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Debt Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Debt Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;
(d) an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and
(e) an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.

The Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test

The “Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test” will be satisfied as at any Determination Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor of the Collateral Debt Obligations as at such Determination Date is equal to or less than the sum of (i) the number set forth in the Moody’s Test Matrix at the intersection of the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)), (acting on behalf of the Issuer) as at such Determination Date plus (ii) the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment, provided, however, that the sum of (i) and (ii) may not exceed 3300.
The “Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor” is determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Debt Obligation, excluding Defaulted Obligations, by its Moody’s Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balances of all such Collateral Debt Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations, and rounding the result up to the nearest whole number.
The “Moody’s Rating Factor” relating to any Collateral Debt Obligation is the number set forth in the table below opposite the Moody’s Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation.

provided that if the Weighted Average Moody’s Recovery Rate for purposes of determining the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment is greater than 60 per cent, then such Weighted Average Moody’s Recovery Rate shall equal 60 per cent. unless Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s is obtained, and provided further that the amount specified in clause (b)(i) may only be allocated once on any Determination Date and the Collateral Manager shall designate to the Collateral Administrator in writing on each such date the portion of such amount that shall be allocated to clause (b)(ii)(A) and the portion of such amount that shall be allocated to clause (b)(ii)(B) (it being understood that, absent an express designation by the Collateral Manager, all such amounts shall be allocated to clause (b)(ii)(A)).
“Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor” means, as of any Determination Date, a number equal to the Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor determined in the following manner: each applicable rating on credit watch by Moody’s that is (a) on review for upgrade will be treated as having been upgraded by one rating subcategory, (b) on review for downgrade will be treated as having been downgraded by two rating subcategories and (c) negative outlook will be treated as having been downgraded by one rating subcategory.
The Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test

The “Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test” will be satisfied, as at any Determination Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Weighted Average Moody’s Recovery Rate is greater than or equal to (i) 44.50 per cent. minus (ii) the Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor Adjustment.
The “Weighted Average Moody’s Recovery Rate” means, as of any Determination Date, the number, expressed as a percentage, obtained by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Debt Obligation (excluding Defaulted Obligations) by its corresponding Moody’s Recovery Rate and dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance (excluding Defaulted Obligations) and rounding the result up to the nearest 0.1 per cent.
The “Moody’s Recovery Rate” is, except as otherwise advised by Moody’s, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, as of any Determination Date, the recovery rate determined in accordance with the following, in the following order of:
(a) if the Collateral Debt Obligation has been specifically assigned a recovery rate by Moody’s (for example, in connection with the assignment by Moody’s of an estimated rating), such recovery rate;
(b) if the preceding clause does not apply to the Collateral Debt Obligation, except with respect to Corporate Rescue Loan, the rate determined pursuant to the table below based on the number of rating subcategories difference between the Collateral Debt Obligation’s Moody’s Rating and its Moody’s Default Probability Rating (for purposes of clarification, if the Moody’s Rating is higher than the Moody’s Default Probability Rating, the rating subcategories difference will be positive and if it is lower, negative):

The “Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor Adjustment” means an amount, expressed as a percentage, as of any Measurement Date equal to the greater of:
(a) zero; and
(b) the number obtained by dividing:
(i) (A) the number set forth in the applicable Moody’s Test Matrix at the intersection of the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) (or interpolating between the two rows containing the closest values and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)), as at such Measurement Date minus (B) the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor; by
(ii) 80 in all cases, and dividing the result by 100. S&P Tests Matrices
The Class Break-Even Default Rate will be determined as follows: (A) the applicable weighted average spread
will be the spread between 2.5 per cent. and 6.0 per cent. (in increments of 0.01 per cent.) without exceeding the sum of (i) the Weighted Average Floating Spread as of such Measurement Date and (ii) the Weighted Average Coupon Adjustment Percentage as of such Measurement Date (“S&P Test Matrix Spread”), (B) the applicable weighted average coupon will be 4.75 per cent. (“S&P Test Matrix Coupon” and, together with the S&P Test Matrix Spread, the “S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon”) and (C) the applicable weighted average recovery rate will be the recovery rate between 20.0 per cent. and 60.0 per cent. (in increments of 0.1 per cent.), a “Recovery Rate Case”, as selected by the Collateral Manager. On and after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the right to choose which Recovery Rate Case applies and which S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon will be applicable for the purposes of the S&P CDO Monitor Test.
After the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager may request for S&P to provide S&P CDO input files for up to 10,000 combinations of S&P Test Matrix Spreads and Coupons and Recovery Rate Cases. On two Business Days’ written notice to the Collateral Administrator (or such shorter time as may be acceptable to the Collateral Administrator), the Collateral Manager may choose a different Recovery Rate Case or a different S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon (or both); provided that the Collateral Debt Obligations must be in compliance with such different Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, and, solely for purposes of this proviso, if the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to invest in a Collateral Debt Obligation, compliance with the newly selected Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, may be determined after giving effect to such investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Collateral Debt Obligations are not currently in compliance with the Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon then applicable and would not be in compliance with any other Recovery Rate Case or S&P
Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, the Collateral Manager may select a different Recovery Rate Case or a different S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon (or both), as applicable, that is not further out of compliance than the current Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable. In the event the Collateral Manager fails to choose (A) a Recovery Rate Case prior to the Effective Date, the following will apply: 36.25 per cent., or, if lower, the highest percentage consistent with the weighted average recovery rate of the Collateral Debt Obligations as of the Effective Date, or (B) an S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon prior to the Effective Date, an S&P Test Matrix Spread of 3.75 per cent., or if lower, the Weighted Average Spread as of the Effective Date, and an S&P Test Matrix Coupon of 4.75 per cent., or if lower, the Weighted Average Coupon as of the Effective Date, will apply.
The S&P CDO Monitor Test

The “S&P CDO Monitor Test” is a test that will be satisfied on any date of determination on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period if, after giving effect to the purchase of a Collateral Debt Obligation (a) during any S&P CDO Model Election Period, the Class Default Differential of the Proposed Portfolio is positive and (b) during any S&P CDO Formula Election Period, the S&P CDO Monitor Adjusted BDR is equal to or greater than the S&P CDO SDR. The S&P CDO Monitor Test shall only be applicable to the junior most Class of Notes rated “AAA” on the Issue Date.
The “Class Break-Even Default Rate” is the maximum percentage of defaults, at any time, which the Current Portfolio or the Proposed Portfolio, as applicable, can sustain, as determined by S&P through application of the S&P CDO Monitor chosen by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the definition of “S&P Test Matrix” that is applicable to the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations, which, after giving effect to S&P’s assumptions on recoveries, defaults and timing (consistent with an assumed S&P Rating of “AAA”) and to the Priorities of Payments, will result in sufficient funds remaining for the payment of the most senior Class of Rated Notes then Outstanding in full. After the Effective Date S&P will provide the Collateral Manager with the Class Break-Even Default Rates for each S&P CDO Monitor based upon the Recovery Rate Case and S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon to be associated with such S&P CDO Monitor as selected by the Collateral Manager (with a copy to the Collateral Administrator) as set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or any other Recovery Rate Case or S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon selected by the Collateral Manager from time to time.
The “Class Default Differential” is, at any time, the rate calculated by subtracting the Class Scenario Default Rate at such time from the Class Break-Even Default Rate at such time.
The “Class Scenario Default Rate” is, at any time, an estimate of the cumulative default rate for the Current Portfolio or the Proposed Portfolio, as applicable, consistent with an assumed S&P Rating of “AAA”, determined by application by the Collateral Manager of the S&P CDO Monitor at such time.
The “Current Portfolio” means, as of any date of determination, the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations (included at their Principal Balance provided that in respect of Mezzanine Obligations, the Principal Balance shall exclude all accrued interest including any interest accrued following the date of acquisition thereof) and Eligible Investments existing prior to the sale, maturity or other disposition of a Collateral Debt Obligation or a proposed reinvestment of Principal Proceeds in a Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation, as the case may be.
The “Proposed Portfolio” means, as of any date of determination, the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations (included at their Principal Balance provided that in respect of Mezzanine Obligations, the Principal Balance shall exclude all accrued interest including any interest accrued following the date of acquisition thereof) and Eligible Investments resulting from the sale, maturity or other disposition of a Collateral Debt Obligation or a proposed reinvestment of Principal Proceeds in a Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation, as the case may be.
“S&P CDO Monitor Adjusted BDR” means the threshold value for the S&P CDO Monitor Test, calculated as a percentage by adjusting the S&P CDO Monitor BDR for changes in the Principal Balance of the Collateral Debt Obligations relative to the Target Par Amount as follows:
S&P CDO Monitor BDR * (OP / NP) + (NP - OP) / (NP * (1 – S&P Weighted Average Recovery Rate)), where OP = Target Par Amount; and NP = the sum of the Aggregate Collateral Balances of the Collateral Debt Obligations (other than any obligation with an S&P Rating below “CCC-”), Principal Proceeds, and the sum of the products of the lower of the S&P Recovery Rate or the Market Value of each obligation with an S&P Rating below “CCC-” and the Principal Balance of the relevant obligation.
“S&P CDO Monitor BDR” means the value calculated using the formula provided by S&P at closing (or such other published formula by S&P that the Collateral Manager provides to the Collateral Administrator):
S&P CDO Monitor BDR = C0 + (C1 * WAS) + (C2 * WARR).

“S&P Industry Diversity Measure” means a measure calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets within each S&P Industry Classification Group in the portfolio, then dividing each of these amounts by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from all the S&P Industry Classification Groups in the portfolio, then squaring the result for each industry, and then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
“S&P Obligor Diversity Measure” means a measure calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from each Obligor and its affiliates, then dividing each such Aggregate Principal Balance by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all S&P CLO Specified Assets from all the Obligors in the Portfolio, then squaring the result for each Obligor, then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
“S&P Recovery Rate” means, in respect of each Collateral Debt Obligation and an assumed S&P Rating of “AAA”, an S&P Recovery Rate determined in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement or as advised by S&P. Extracts of the S&P Recovery Rates applicable under the Collateral Management Agreement as at the Issue Date are set out in Annex B (S&P Recovery Rates) of this Offering Circular.
“S&P Regional Diversity Measure” means a measure calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets within each S&P region set forth in Annex C (S&P CDO Evaluator Country Codes, Regions and Recovery Groups) of this Offering Circular, then dividing each of these amounts by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from all S&P regions in the portfolio, then squaring the result for each region, then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
“S&P Weighted Average Life” means the value calculated by determining the number of years between the current date and the maturity date of each S&P CLO Specified Asset, then multiplying each S&P CLO Specified Asset’s Principal Balance by such number of years, and then summing this amount of all S&P CLO Specified Assets, and dividing this amount by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all S&P CLO Specified Assets.
“S&P Weighted Average Rating Factor” means the value calculated by multiplying the Principal Balance for each S&P CLO Specified Asset by its S&P Global Ratings Factor, then summing the results of all S&P CLO Specified Assets, and then dividing this result by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets.
“S&P Weighted Average Recovery Rate” means, as of any Measurement Date, the number (expressed as a percentage) obtained by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance (excluding Purchased Accrued Interest) of each Collateral Debt Obligation by its S&P Recovery Rate, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Collateral Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations and rounding up to the nearest 0.1 per cent. For purposes of this rate, the Principal Balance of any Defaulted Obligation shall be deemed to be zero.
“S&P Weighted Average Spread” means the aggregate of the Weighted Average Spread plus the Weighted Average Coupon Adjustment Percentage.
The Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test

The “Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test” will be satisfied if, as at any Determination Date from (and including) the Effective Date the Weighted Average Floating Spread as at such Determination Date plus the Weighted Average Coupon Adjustment Percentage as at such Determination Date equals or exceeds the Minimum Weighted Average Floating Spread as at such Determination Date.
The “Minimum Weighted Average Floating Spread”, as of any Determination Date, means the weighted average spread (expressed as a percentage) applicable to the current Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the option chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)) reduced by the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment, provided such reduction may not reduce the Minimum Weighted Average Spread below 2.40 per cent.
The “Weighted Average Floating Spread” as of any Determination Date, is the number obtained by dividing:
(a) the amount equal to (A) the Aggregate Funded Spread plus (B) the Aggregate Unfunded Spread plus
(C) (save for the purposes of the S&P CDO Monitor Test) the Aggregate Excess Funded Spread; by
(b) an amount equal to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligations as of such Determination Date, in each case, excluding (x) Defaulted Obligations, Partial PIK Obligations (in respect of any non-cash paying interest) and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations and Revolving Obligations) and (y) any interest capitalised pursuant to the terms of such instruments other than, with respect to a Mezzanine Obligation and a PIK Obligation, any such interest capitalised pursuant to the terms thereof which is paid for on the date of acquisition of such Mezzanine Obligation or PIK Obligation,
in each case adjusted for any withholding tax deducted in respect of the relevant obligation which is neither grossed up nor recoverable under any applicable double tax treaty.
The “Aggregate Funded Spread” is, as of any Determination Date, the sum of:
(a) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Non-Euro Obligations, Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities, Partial PIK Obligations (in respect of any non- cash paying interest) and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation and Revolving Debt Obligation) that bears interest at a spread over EURIBOR, (i) the stated interest rate spread on such Collateral Debt Obligation above EURIBOR multiplied by (ii) the Principal Balance of such Collateral Debt Obligation (excluding the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation) (for the purposes of this paragraph (a) only, each reference to “EURIBOR” so far as it relates to a Collateral Debt Obligation shall mean EURIBOR as determined pursuant to the Underlying Instrument in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation);
(b) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Non-Euro Obligations, Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities, Partial PIK Obligations (in respect of any non- cash paying interest) and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation and Revolving Obligation) that bears interest at a spread over an index other than EURIBOR, (i) the excess of the sum of such spread and such index over the EURIBOR rate that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the corresponding interest rate in respect of such Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation as of the immediately preceding interest determination date pursuant to the relevant Underlying Instrument (which spread or excess may be expressed as a negative percentage) multiplied by (ii) the Principal Balance of each such Collateral Debt Obligation (excluding the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation or Revolving Obligation);

(d) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Non-Euro Obligation (including, only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities, Partial PIK Obligations (in respect of any non-cash paying interest) and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation and Revolving Obligation) and which is not subject to an Asset Swap Transaction, the Euro equivalent (at the Applicable Exchange Rate) of (1) the interest amount payable by the relevant obligor, less (2) the product of (x) the EURIBOR rate that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the corresponding interest rate in respect of such Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation as of the immediately preceding interest determination date pursuant to the relevant Underlying Instrument (which spread or excess may be expressed as a negative percentage) multiplied by (y) its outstanding principal amount (excluding any interest capitalised pursuant to the terms of such instrument other than, with respect to a Mezzanine Obligation and a PIK Obligation, any such interest capitalised pursuant to the terms thereof which is paid for on the date of acquisition of such Mezzanine Obligation or PIK Obligation).
provided that for purposes of this definition, the interest rate spread will be deemed to be, with respect to (1) any Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation that has a EURIBOR floor at or above zero, (i) the stated interest rate spread plus, (ii) if positive, (x) the EURIBOR (or such other floating rate of interest) floor value minus (y) the greater of (a) zero and (b) EURIBOR (or such other floating rate of interest) applicable in respect of such Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation on such Measurement Date, and (2) any Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligation that has no EURIBOR floor or a EURIBOR floor below zero, (i) the stated interest rate spread plus, (ii) the higher of (x) the EURIBOR floor value (provided that any asset which has no EURIBOR floor shall be deemed to have a EURIBOR floor equal to the lower of (a) zero and (b) the EURIBOR as in effect for the current Accrual Period)

and dividing such sum by:
(b) the Aggregate Principal Balance at such time of all Collateral Debt Obligations (other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring Securities) and such Eligible Investments representing Principal Proceeds.
“Average Life” is, on any Measurement Date with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the products of (a) the number of years (rounded to the nearest one hundredth thereof) from such Determination Date to the respective dates of each successive scheduled distribution of principal of such Collateral Debt Obligation and (b) the respective amounts of principal of such scheduled distributions by
(ii) the sum of all successive scheduled distributions of principal on such Collateral Debt Obligation.
Moody’s Ratings Definitions

“Assigned Moody’s Rating” means the monitored publicly available rating or the unpublished monitored loan rating or the credit estimate expressly assigned to a debt obligation (or facility) by Moody’s which addresses the full amount of principal and interest to be paid (or repaid) thereunder, provided that, in respect of a credit estimate, if such credit estimate is valid, current and has been in existence (and not otherwise refreshed) for more than 12 months but less than 15 months from receipt thereof by the Issuer or Collateral Manager, as the case may be, then the Assigned Moody’s Rating is one subcategory lower than the credit estimate, and provided further that, if such credit estimate is valid, current and has been in existence (and not otherwise refreshed) for more than 15 months from receipt thereof by the Issuer or Collateral Manager, as the case may be, then such Collateral Debt Obligation shall be deemed to have an Assigned Moody’s Rating of “Caa3”.
“CFR” means, with respect to an obligor of a Collateral Debt Obligation, if such obligor has a corporate family rating by Moody’s, then such corporate family rating; provided, if such obligor does not have a corporate family rating by Moody’s but any entity in the obligor’s corporate family does have a corporate family rating, then the CFR is such corporate family rating.
“Moody’s Default Probability Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has a CFR by Moody’s, then such CFR;
(b) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Assigned Moody’s Rating on such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(c) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has one or more senior secured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is one subcategory lower than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such senior secured obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(d) if not determined pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (c) above, if a credit estimate has been assigned to such Collateral Debt Obligation by Moody’s upon the request of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, then the Moody’s Default Probability Rating is such credit estimate provided that, if such credit estimate is valid, current and has been in existence (and not otherwise refreshed) for more than 13 months but less than 15 months from receipt thereof by the Issuer or Collateral Manager, as the case may be, then the Moody’s Default Probability Rating is one subcategory lower than the credit estimate, and provided further that, if such credit estimate is valid, current and has been in existence (and not otherwise refreshed) for more than 15 months from receipt thereof by the Issuer or Collateral Manager, as the case may be, then such Collateral Debt Obligation shall be deemed to have a Moody’s Default Probability Rating of “Caa3”;
(e) if not determined pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Moody’s Derived Rating; and
(f) if not determined pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the Collateral Debt Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Default Probability Rating of “Caa3”.
For purposes of calculating a Moody’s Default Probability Rating, each applicable rating on credit watch by Moody’s with positive or negative implication at the time of calculation will be treated, respectively, as having been upgraded or downgraded by one rating subcategory, as the case may be.
“Moody’s Derived Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) with respect to any Corporate Rescue Loan, one subcategory below the facility rating (whether public or private) of such Corporate Rescue Loan rated by Moody’s;
(b) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has a long-term issuer rating by Moody’s, then such long-term issuer rating;
(c) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, if another obligation of the Obligor is rated by Moody’s, then by adjusting the rating of the related Moody’s rated obligations of the related Obligor by the number of rating sub-categories according to the table below:
Obligation Category of Rated Obligation
‎
Rating of Rated Obligation
‎Number of Subcategories Relative to Rated Obligation Rating

Senior secured obligation...........greater than or equal to B2 -1
Senior secured obligation ...........less than B2 -2
Subordinated obligation .............greater than or equal to B3 +1

Not Structured Finance
Obligation Loan or Participation in Loan -2
(ii) if such Collateral Debt Obligation is not rated by any NRSRO but another security or obligation of the Obligor has a public and monitored rating by any NRSRO (a “parallel security”), then the rating of such parallel security will at the election of the Collateral Manager be determined in accordance with the table set forth in sub clause (e)(i) above, and the Moody’s Derived Rating for the purposes of clause (d) of the definition of Moody’s Rating and Moody’s Default Probability Rating (as applicable) of such Collateral Debt Obligation will be determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in clause (a) above (for such purposes treating the parallel security as if it were rated by Moody’s at the rating determined pursuant to this sub clause (e)(ii)); or
(iii) if such Collateral Debt Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan, no Moody’s Derived Rating may be determined based on a rating by any NRSRO; or
(f) if such Collateral Debt Obligation is not rated by Moody’s or any NRSRO and no other security or obligation of the issuer of such Collateral Debt Obligation is rated by Moody’s or any NRSRO, and if Moody’s has been requested by the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the issuer of such Collateral Debt Obligation to assign a rating or rating estimate with respect to such Collateral Debt Obligation but such rating or rating estimate has not been received, pending receipt of such estimate, the Moody’s Derived Rating for purposes of clause (d) of the definition of Moody’s Rating and Moody’s Default Probability Rating (as applicable) of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall be (x) “B3” if the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that the Collateral Manager believes that such estimate will be at least “B3” and if the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations determined pursuant to this clause (f) does not exceed 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations or (y) otherwise, “Caa2”.
For purposes of calculating a Moody’s Derived Rating, each applicable rating on credit watch by Moody’s with positive or negative implication at the time of calculation will be treated, respectively, as having been upgraded or downgraded by one rating subcategory, as the case may be.
“Moody’s Rating” means,
(a) with respect to a Collateral Debt Obligation that is a Senior Secured Loan or Senior Secured Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Debt Obligation has an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Assigned Moody’s Rating;

(iii) if neither clause (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Debt Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is two sub-categories higher than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(iv) if none of clauses (i) through (iii) above apply, at the election of the Collateral Manager, the Moody’s Derived Rating; and
(v) if none of clauses (i) through (iv) above apply, the Collateral Debt Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Rating of “Caa3”;
(b) with respect to a Collateral Debt Obligation other than a Senior Secured Loan or Senior Secured Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Debt Obligation has an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Assigned Moody’s Rating;
(ii) if such Collateral Debt Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Debt Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has a CFR, then the Moody’s rating that is one sub-category lower than such CFR;
(iv) if none of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above apply, if such Collateral Debt Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation has one or more subordinated debt obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is one sub-category higher than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;

(vi) if none of clauses (i) through (v) above apply, the Collateral Debt Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Rating of “Caa3”.
For purposes of calculating a Moody’s Rating, each applicable rating on credit watch by Moody’s with positive or negative implication at the time of calculation will be treated as having been upgraded or downgraded by one rating subcategory, as the case may be.
“Moody’s Senior Secured Loan” means:
(a) a loan that:
(i) is not (and cannot by its terms become) subordinate in right of payment to any other debt obligation of the obligor of the loan; other than borrowed money, trade claims, capitalised leases or other similar obligations, or no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or stock, provided that a revolving loan of the Obligor that, pursuant to its terms, may require one or more advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or stock in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loan representing up to 15.0 per cent. of the Obligor’s senior debt (or more if Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s has been obtained);
(ii) (x) is secured by a valid first priority perfected security interest or lien in, to or on specified collateral securing the obligor’s obligations under the loan and (y) such specified collateral does not consist entirely of equity securities or common stock; provided that any loan that would be considered a Moody’s Senior Secured Loan but for clause (y) above shall be considered a Moody’s Senior Secured Loan if it is a loan made to a parent entity and as to which the Collateral Manager determines in good faith that the value of the common stock of the subsidiary (or other equity interests in the subsidiary) securing such loan at or about the time of acquisition of such loan by the Issuer has a value that is at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of such loan and the outstanding principal balances of any other obligations of such parent entity that are pari passu with such loan, which value may include, among other things, the enterprise value of such subsidiary of such parent entity; and
(iii) the value of the collateral securing the loan together with other attributes of the obligor (including, without limitation, its general financial condition, ability to generate cash flow available for debt service and other demands for that cash flow) is adequate (in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager) to repay the loan in accordance with its terms and to repay all other loans of equal seniority secured by a first lien or security interest in the same collateral); and
(b) the loan is not:
(i) a Corporate Rescue Loan; or
(ii) a loan for which the security interest or lien (or the validity or effectiveness thereof) in substantially all of its collateral attaches, becomes effective, or otherwise “springs” into existence after the origination thereof.
“Moody’s Senior Secured Floating Rate Note” means, a Senior Secured Floating Rate Note that (x) has a Moody’s facility rating and the obligor of such note has a Moody’s corporate family rating and (y) such Moody’s facility rating is not lower than such Moody’s corporate family rating.
S&P Ratings Definitions

“S&P Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if there is an S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer of such Collateral Debt Obligation by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Collateral Debt Obligation (such guarantee to comply with the current S&P criteria on guarantees), then the S&P Rating shall be such rating (regardless of whether there is a published rating by S&P on the Collateral Debt Obligations of such issuer held by the Issuer, provided that private ratings (that is, ratings provided at the request of the Obligor) may be used for purposes of this definition if the related Obligor has consented to the disclosure thereof and a copy of such consent has been provided to S&P);
(b) if there is no S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer or guarantor by S&P but,
(i) there is a senior secured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall be one sub-category below such rating;
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, but there is a senior unsecured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall equal such rating; and
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) above applies, but there is a subordinated rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall be one sub-category above such rating;
(c) with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation that is a Current Pay Obligation, the S&P Rating applicable to such obligation shall be the issue level rating thereof and if there is no such issue level rating, the S&P Rating applicable to such Current Pay Obligation shall be “CCC-”;
(d) with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation that is a Corporate Rescue Loan:
(i) falling within paragraph (a) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned a public rating to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such public rating; or
(ii) falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned an S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate (as applicable), provided that if no S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate is available but S&P has issued a public rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan then such public rating after notching in accordance with limb (b) above shall be the S&P Rating; or
(iii) upon application by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) to S&P for a credit estimate, the applicable Corporate Rescue Loan shall be deemed to have an S&P Rating of “D”;
(e) if there is not a rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be determined (other than in the case of Corporate Rescue Loans) pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (ii) below:
(i) if an obligation of the issuer is not a Corporate Rescue Loan and is publicly rated by Moody’s or Fitch, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing the S&P Rating set forth above except that the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (1) one sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Baa3” or higher or Fitch rating if such Fitch rating is “BBB” or higher and (2) two sub- categories below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Ba1” or lower or Fitch rating if such Fitch rating is “BB+” or lower; provided that in each case, the S&P Rating will be a further sub-category below the S&P equivalent rating of the applicable obligation if the relevant Moody’s or Fitch rating is on “credit watch negative” by Moody’s or “rating watch negative” by Fitch; provided, further, that the S&P Rating shall not be determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) in respect of any Collateral Debt Obligation, if doing so would result in the Aggregate Collateral Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations for which S&P Ratings have been determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) exceeding 15 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance at the relevant time (where, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Collateral Balance, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be equal to its S&P Collateral Value); and
(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by S&P, and in connection therewith, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer or the issuer of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall, prior to or within 30 days after the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation, apply (and concurrently submit all available information in respect of such application) to S&P for a credit estimate which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, if such information is submitted within such 30 day period, then, for a period of up to 90 days after acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation by the Issuer and pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, such Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating as determined by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if (A) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and that the S&P Rating, will be at least equal to such rating and (B) the Aggregate Collateral Balance of the Collateral Debt Obligations subject to an S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager in accordance with (A) does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for such purpose the Principal Balance of all Defaulted Obligations shall be their S&P Collateral Value); provided, further, that: (x) if such information is not submitted within such 30 day period and (y) following the end of the 90-day period set forth above, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-”; unless, in the case of clause
(y) above, during such 90-day period, the Collateral Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided, further, that; if the Collateral Debt Obligation has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a credit estimate in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation, the S&P Rating in respect thereof shall be “CCC-” pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, and S&P may elect not to provide such estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided, further, that such credit estimate shall expire 12 months after the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation, following which such Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-” unless, during such 12 month period, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) applies for renewal thereof in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement in which case such credit estimate shall continue to be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation; provided, further, that such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall expire on the next succeeding 12-month anniversary of the date of the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation and (when renewed annually in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement) on each 12-month anniversary thereafter; and
(f) with respect to a Collateral Debt Obligation that is not a Defaulted Obligation, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation will at the election of the Issuer (at the direction of the Collateral Manager) be “CCC-”; provided that (i) neither the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings; (ii) the Obligor thereof has not defaulted on any payment obligation in respect of any debt security or other obligation of such Obligor at any time within the two year period ending on such date of determination and all such debt securities and other obligations of the Obligor are current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects them to remain current; and (iii) the Collateral Debt Obligation is current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects it to remain current,
provided that for purposes of the determination of the S&P Rating, (x) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch positive” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub- category above such assigned rating, (y) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch negative” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating and (z) only ratings assigned on the basis of ongoing surveillance will be applicable for the purposes of this definition.
“S&P Issuer Credit Rating” means in respect of a Collateral Debt Obligation, a publicly available issuer credit rating by S&P in respect of the Obligor thereof.
The Coverage Tests
The Coverage Tests will consist of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class E Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test and the Class D Interest Coverage Test.
The Coverage Tests will be used primarily to determine whether interest may be paid on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes, whether Principal Proceeds may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, or whether Interest Proceeds and, to the extent needed, Principal Proceeds, in the event of failure to satisfy the Class A/B Coverage Tests, must instead be used to pay principal on the Class A Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class B Notes, to the extent necessary to cause the Class A/B Coverage Tests to be satisfied if recalculated immediately following such redemption; or, in the event of failure to satisfy the Class C Coverage Tests, to pay principal on the Class A Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class B Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class C Notes to the extent necessary to cause the Class C Coverage Tests to be satisfied if recalculated immediately following such redemption; or, in the event of failure to satisfy the Class D Coverage Tests, to pay principal on the Class A Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class B Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class C Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class D Notes to the extent necessary to cause the Class D Coverage Tests to be satisfied if recalculated immediately following such redemption; or, in the event of failure of the Class E Par Value Test, to pay principal on the Class A Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class B Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class C Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class D Notes and, after redemption in full thereof, principal on the Class E Notes to the extent necessary to cause the Class E Par Value Test to be satisfied if recalculated immediately following such redemption.
Each of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class D Interest Coverage Test and the Class E Par Value Test, shall apply on a Determination Date (i) on and after the Effective Date in respect of the Par Value Tests and (ii) on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests and shall be satisfied on a Determination Date if the corresponding Par Value Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio (as the case may be) is at least equal to the percentage specified in the table below in relation to that Coverage Test.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
The following description of the Collateral Management Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

General
The Collateral Manager will perform certain investment management functions, including directing the purchase and sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and performing certain administrative functions on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral Management Agreement. The Collateral Manager agrees, and will be authorised, to (i) select the Collateral Debt Obligations to be acquired by the Issuer, (ii) monitor the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations on an ongoing basis and advise the Issuer as to which Collateral Debt Obligations to sell and which Collateral Debt Obligations to acquire and (iii) assist the Issuer in the preparation of reports, orders and other documents, in each case to the extent required pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Collateral Management Agreement also permits the Collateral Manager, in its discretion, to engage on behalf of the Issuer in (a) cross transactions between the Issuer and another client of the Collateral Manager provided it has reasonable grounds to believe that any such cross transaction is justified from the perspective of the Issuer and is consistent with the Issuer’s investment policies and (b) agency cross transactions effected through a broker- dealer affiliated with the Collateral Manager, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Collateral Management Agreement.
The Collateral Management Agreement also permits the Collateral Manager to engage on behalf of the Issuer in principal transactions, subject to procedures developed by the Collateral Manager to address conflicts of interest. The Collateral Manager’s current procedures regarding principal transactions require that it obtain, prior to effecting any principal transaction, the consent of the board of directors of the Issuer to such principal transaction. Those procedures require that the Collateral Manager disclose to the board of directors of the Issuer (i) the capacity in which it is acting; (ii) that the transaction is a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of the Collateral Debt Obligation for which market quotations are readily available;
(iii) that the transaction is effected at the independent current market price determined as follows (x) if the transaction is an interest in a bank loan traded in a dealer market, at the next price reported at the close of such market by an independent pricing service so long as the reliability of the prices provided by the pricing service have been found to be indicative of market value; and (y) for all other transactions, the average of at least two current independent bids determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry; (iv) that the transaction is consistent with the investment policies of the Issuer; and (v) that no brokerage commission or fee (except for customary transfer fees or other remuneration) will be paid in connection with the transaction.
Neither the Collateral Manager nor any Collateral Manager Related Person will be liable to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person for any loss incurred as a result of the actions taken by or recommended by the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach, gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts) or reckless disregard in the performance of its obligations thereunder. Subject to the above mentioned standard of conduct, the Collateral Manager, its shareholders, directors, officers, partners, members, managers, attorneys, advisers, agents, employees and each Collateral Manager Related Person will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer for any losses or liabilities, including legal or other expenses, relating to the issuance of the Notes, the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement, which will be payable in accordance with the Priority of Payments and not arising as a result of breach arising from the bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct, wilful breach, gross negligence (as such concept is interpreted by the New York courts) (or in the case of any pecuniary sanctions to which the Collateral Manager may be become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation, negligence) or reckless disregard of the Collateral Manager.
Resignation of the Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager may resign, upon 90 days’ (or such shorter notice as is acceptable to the Issuer) written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and each Rating Agency. Such resignation will not be effective until the date as of which a successor collateral manager has been appointed as described below.
Removal of the Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager may, following the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (vi) of the definition thereof, be removed by the Issuer upon 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Hedge Counterparties, and each Rating Agency at the direction of (i) the Controlling Class (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) or (ii) holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Ordinary Resolution) (in each case, excluding (x) the holders of any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and CM Non-Voting Notes and (y) those Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons). Such removal and/or termination will not be effective until the date as of which a successor collateral manager has been appointed as described below.
Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement, if the Collateral Manager becomes aware that a Collateral Manager Event of Default has occurred, the Collateral Manager will be required to give prompt written notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Noteholders, the Hedge Counterparties and each Rating Agency upon the Collateral Manager becoming aware of the occurrence of such Collateral Manager Event of Default.
Termination of the Collateral Management Agreement
The Collateral Management Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the payment in full of the Notes, in accordance with their terms, (ii) the liquidation of the Portfolio and the final distribution of the proceeds of such liquidation as provided in the Transaction Documents, and (iii) the determination in good faith by the Issuer that the Issuer or the Portfolio has become required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and the Issuer notifies the Collateral Manager thereof.
Appointment of Successor
Upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Collateral Manager to carry on its duties under the Collateral Management Agreement), the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until the appointment by the Issuer, at the direction of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution (excluding any Subordinated Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons), of a successor manager meeting the Successor Criteria in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement, provided that the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution (excluding the holders of any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, CM Non-Voting Notes and any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons), does not object in writing to such successor within 45 days after receipt of notice of such nomination.
If within three months following a notice of resignation or removal, no successor collateral manager has been appointed and accepted such appointment, then the holders of the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution (excluding the holders of any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and CM Non-Voting Notes and any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons), may appoint a successor collateral manager and the Issuer shall appoint such successor subject to (i) Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation and (ii) the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution (excluding any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons).
If within four months following a notice of resignation or removal, no successor collateral manager has been appointed and accepted such appointment, then the holders of the Subordinated Notes, acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution (excluding any Subordinated Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons), may appoint a successor collateral manager and the Issuer shall appoint such successor subject to (i) Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation and (ii) the holders of the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution (excluding the holders of any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, CM Non- Voting Notes and any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons).
If within five months following a notice of resignation or removal no successor collateral manager has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Collateral Manager (provided that no EU Retention Deficiency has occurred and is continuing) may make such appointment, which appointment shall be final.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Notes held (i) in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non- Voting Notes or (ii) by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons (other than, in respect of the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager which is not a Collateral Manager Related
Person and where the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager is not due to the Collateral Manager having been removed due to a Collateral Manager Event of Default in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Conditions) shall have any voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Replacement Resolution or with respect to the selection or appointment of the successor collateral manager following a CM Removal Resolution.
Any successor collateral manager is required to be an established entity that satisfies the following criteria (collectively, the “Successor Criteria”):
(a) has the ability to professionally and competently perform duties similar to those imposed upon the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement;
(b) is legally qualified and has the capacity to act as Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement;
(c) its appointment or the performance of its activities does not cause the Issuer to become subject to taxation in any jurisdiction other than Ireland or be subject to any other material adverse taxation consequences (and for these purposes the determination of a “material adverse taxation consequence” shall (i) take into account all relevant taxation circumstances which exist at the time of the assessment of the Successor Criteria and (ii) not include any taxation consequences that would be incurred by, or imposed on, the Issuer irrespective of the identity of a particular successor collateral manager);
(d) its appointment will not cause the Collateral Manager to breach the terms of the EU Retention Letter or, if such successor is to commit to retain the Retention Notes subject to and in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, such successor enters into an agreement on substantially the same terms as the EU Retention Letter to acquire the Retention Notes on the date of its appointment as collateral manager; and
(e) it shall not cause the Issuer or the Collateral to become required to be registered under the provisions of the Investment Company Act.
Assignment
The Collateral Manager may assign or transfer its rights and/or obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement subject to, and in accordance with, the Collateral Management Agreement, provided that the assignee/transferee satisfies the criteria set out in the Successor Criteria. The consent of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution shall be required for any assignment or transfer by the Collateral Manager of its rights and/or obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement where the proposed assignee or transferee is not an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Manager will provide notice to the Trustee (for forwarding to Noteholders and each Rating Agency) of any assignment or transfer of the Collateral Manager’s rights and/or obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement. The Collateral Manager may grant security over its rights to the Collateral Management Fees under the Collateral Management Agreement.
Delegation
Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Manager may, without any prior written consent, delegate any of its powers, duties and obligations to an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager which, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Manager, has sufficient personnel and other resources to undertake the duties delegated to it.
Fees and expenses
As compensation for the performance of its obligations as Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will be entitled to receive a fee, which will be payable to the Collateral Manager in arrear on each Payment Date (pro- rated for the related Accrual Period), in an amount equal to the sum of (a) 0.1269 per cent. per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) of the Fee Basis Amount for such Payment Date (exclusive of any VAT) (the “Senior Collateral Management Fee”), (b) 0.1904 per cent. per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) of the Fee Basis Amount for such Payment Date (exclusive of any VAT) (the “Subordinated Collateral Management Fee”) and (c) after the Subordinated Notes have realised the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold, an amount equal to,
as applicable on such Payment Date, the sum of 20 per cent. of any remaining Interest Proceeds distributable pursuant to paragraph (BB) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, 20 per cent. of any remaining Principal Proceeds distributable pursuant to paragraph (R) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and 20 per cent. of any remaining proceeds distributable pursuant to paragraph (X) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such payments described in this paragraph (c), being exclusive of any VAT thereon and collectively, the “Incentive Collateral Management Fee” and, together with the Senior Collateral Management Fee and the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee, the “Collateral Management Fee”) which shall be senior to the residual distributions on the Subordinated Notes, pro rata pari passu, in the case of (a) the Senior Collateral Management Fee with Senior Class M-2 Interest Amounts payable on the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes and
(b) the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee with Subordinated Class M-2 Interest Amounts payable on the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes.
On any Payment Date, the Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, elect to defer any Senior Collateral Management Fees or Subordinated Collateral Management Fees. Any amounts so deferred shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
Any due and unpaid Collateral Management Fees will accrue interest (in arrear) for the period commencing on the Payment Date on which such amount was due to (but excluding) the Payment Date on which it is repaid in accordance with the Priorities of Payments at the EURIBOR rate applicable to the Rated Notes for each Accrual Period that such amount is unpaid. Such accrued and unpaid interest thereon will be payable on any subsequent Payment Date to the extent funds are available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Deferred Senior Collateral Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Collateral Management Amounts shall not accrue interest.
The Collateral Manager may also, in its sole discretion, elect to designate the Senior Collateral Management Fee or the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee for reinvestment to be used to purchase substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, or to purchase Rated Notes in accordance with the Conditions (or to be deposited in the Principal Account pending such reinvestment or purchase in accordance with the Conditions).
If on any Payment Date there are insufficient funds to pay any amount in respect of the Collateral Management Fee in full, the amount not so paid will be deferred and will be payable on such later Payment Date on which funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager will be reimbursed by the Issuer for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with (i) the offering of the Notes and the negotiation and documentation of the Transaction Documents, including the Collateral Management Agreement (including legal fees and expenses and any irrecoverable VAT thereon), and (ii) the performance of its obligations under the Collateral Management Agreement as further set out in the Collateral Management Agreement.
Issuer UK Tax Representative Indemnity
The Issuer will also agree to indemnify the Collateral Manager and/or any of its members against any Issuer UK Tax Representative Liabilities provided that this shall not apply to the extent that such liabilities would not have arisen but as a direct consequence of a Collateral Manager Breach (as defined in the Collateral Management Agreement).
“Issuer UK Tax Representative Liability” means any liability of the Issuer to UK corporation tax, UK income tax or UK diverted profits tax (and in each case interest and/or penalties thereon) which is:
(a) imposed on the Collateral Manager and/or any of its members and recoverable from the Collateral Manager and/or any of its members, under Chapter 6 of Part 22 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, chapter 2B of Part 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and Part 1 of Schedule 16 to the Finance Act 2015; or

and in respect of each liability to UK corporation tax, UK income tax or UK diverted profits tax, any costs or expenses reasonably incurred by the Collateral Manager and/or any of its members in connection therewith (including, without limitation, properly incurred fees and expenses of legal counsel, together with any irrecoverable VAT payable thereon).
No Voting Rights

Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager, or any Collateral Manager Related Person or held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes (a) will have no voting rights with respect to any vote (or written direction or consent) and (b) shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on, in each case for the purposes of, any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution (other than, in the case of Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person, a CM Replacement Resolution in respect of the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager which is not Affiliated with the Collateral Manager and where the appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager is not due to the Collateral Manager having been removed due to a Collateral Manager Event of Default in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and the Conditions) and will be deemed not to be Outstanding in connection with any such vote, provided, however, that any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Persons or any CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will have voting rights (including in respect of written directions and consents) with respect to all other matters as to which Noteholders are entitled to vote.

ESMA Reporting Templates

The Transitional Requirements will apply to the underlying exposure and investor reporting obligations under Article 7(1)(a) and (e) until the regulatory technical standards relating to the EU Transparency Requirements to be adopted by the European Commission apply. The Transitional Requirements provide that, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in the Annexes of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the “CRA3 RTS”). However, there is no dedicated template within Annexes I to VII of the CRA3 RTS for underlying exposure reporting in respect of CLO transactions nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS. Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS sets out the investor reporting obligations and will apply to CLO transactions. The Issuer intends to initially make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Reports.
Upon the adoption of the final ESMA reporting templates for the purposes of compliance with the EU Transparency Requirements, the Transitional Requirements shall cease to apply and the required forms of Investor Reports and Loan Reports will be provided on a quarterly basis thereafter.

ESMA Reporting Templates

The Transitional Requirements will apply to the underlying exposure and investor reporting obligations under Article 7(1)(a) and (e) until the regulatory technical standards relating to the EU Transparency Requirements to be adopted by the European Commission apply.

However, there is no dedicated template
within Annexes I to VII of the CRA3 RTS for underlying exposure reporting in respect of CLO transactions nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS.

Upon the adoption of the final ESMA reporting templates for the purposes of compliance with the EU Transparency Requirements, the Transitional Requirements shall cease to apply and the required forms of Investor Reports and Loan Reports will be provided on a quarterly basis thereafter.

DESCRIPTION OF THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY AGREEMENT
The following description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

Liquidity Facility Agreement

Commitment

The maximum amount of the facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) under the Liquidity Facility Agreement will be the Commitment.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Manager and The Bank of New York Mellon, as a liquidity facility provider (the “Liquidity Facility Provider”), will enter into a liquidity facility agreement (the “Liquidity Facility Agreement”) to be dated on or about the Issue Date.
Purposes
For the period (the “Liquidity Facility Commitment Period”) from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the earliest of (a) the Business Day that is immediately preceding the date that is four years from the Issue Date, subject to renewal for one or two additional one year periods at the Liquidity Facility Provider’s sole and absolute discretion; (b) the date on which the Liquidity Facility is cancelled in its entirety in accordance with its terms; and (c) the date on which the Rated Notes are redeemed in full or, in each case, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately prior to such day (the “Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date”), the Issuer will, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, be entitled to draw funds under the Liquidity Facility Agreement for the payment of amounts under, and in accordance with, the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments (other than amounts payable to the Liquidity Facility Provider pursuant to paragraph (E) thereof) including, for the avoidance of doubt, to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to paragraph (BB) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, on any Drawdown Date that is a Payment Date (provided that all Interest Proceeds have been or will be applied in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments on such Payment Date prior to any application of funds drawn under the Liquidity Facility Agreement) or to the extent requested, the refinancing of any Initial Drawdown (or any refinancing thereof), and not for any other purpose provided that the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn down for such purposes on any Drawdown Date shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Available Commitment and (ii) the Accrued Collateral Debt Obligation Interest in respect of the relevant Payment Date (to the extent that each applicable Coverage Test senior to the payment of the amounts payable in respect of such paragraph is satisfied on the relevant Determination Date).
Drawings and Repayments
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, Initial Drawdowns or Subsequent Drawdowns (each as defined in the Conditions) may be made under the Liquidity Facility Agreement for the purpose of payment of amounts under, and in accordance with, the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments on any Payment Date by no later than
(i) in the case of Initial Drawdowns, four Business Days’ notice but no more than seven Business Days’ notice and (ii) in the case of Subsequent Drawdowns, two Business Days’ notice but no more than seven Business Days’ notice. Initial Drawdowns and Subsequent Drawdowns are subject to a limit equal to the lesser of (i) the Available Commitment and (ii) the Accrued Collateral Debt Obligation Interest in respect of the relevant Payment Date.
Liquidity Drawings shall be subject to the following conditions precedent:
(a) not more than four Liquidity Drawings may be made in any rolling 12 month period;
(b) the Rated Notes not having been redeemed in full and not being scheduled to be redeemed in full on the immediately following Payment Date (as determined by reference to the circumstances existing on such date of determination);
(c) on both the date on which such Liquidity Drawing is requested and on the relevant Drawdown Date, no Note Event of Default or Liquidity Facility Event of Default is outstanding or would result from the provision of such Liquidity Drawing;
(d) each applicable Coverage Test senior to the item of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments that is proposed to receive payment is satisfied on the relevant Determination Date, for such purpose assuming that such Liquidity Drawing has been made;
(e) payment in full of any prior Liquidity Drawing (unless such Liquidity Drawing is being refinanced as a Subsequent Drawdown); and
(f) on both the date on which such Liquidity Drawing is requested and on the relevant Drawdown Date, all representations and warranties made under the Liquidity Facility Agreement are true and accurate in all material respects.
Each Liquidity Drawing shall have an interest period commencing on the relevant Drawdown Date and ending on the relevant Repayment Date (as defined below) or Payment Date as applicable.
Pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, may redraw one or more times, as applicable, an amount thereunder to refinance (in whole or in part) any Initial Drawdown(s) or Subsequent Drawdown(s). Amounts payable between the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Issuer in respect of such drawdown and refinancing shall be payable on a net basis such that, save to the extent a net amount is due from the Issuer in respect of such drawdown and refinancing, the availability of such Subsequent Drawdown to be drawn shall not be dependent on the availability of actual cash funds of the Issuer to discharge the Initial Drawdown(s) or Subsequent Drawdown(s) being refinanced.
The Issuer shall be required to repay all Liquidity Drawings outstanding under the Liquidity Facility Agreement and the Available Commitment shall automatically be cancelled in full, on the earlier to occur of (a) final redemption of the Notes (other than as a result of a Note Event of Default); (b) the occurrence of a Note Event of Default or the Liquidity Facility is accelerated in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement following the occurrence of an event of default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement; (c) the Payment Date immediately following the occurrence of the Moody’s rating assigned to the Class A Notes (or the Class B Notes if the Class A Notes are no longer Outstanding) being downgraded below “Ba2” or the S&P rating assigned to the Class A Notes (or the Class B Notes if the Class A Notes are no longer Outstanding) is below “BB” and (d) the Payment Date immediately following the last day of the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period (the “Final Repayment Date”).
The Issuer shall be required to repay any outstanding Liquidity Drawing on the Repayment Date (as defined below) related thereto in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payments (which repayment may be effected by way of a refinancing thereof under a Subsequent Drawdown); provided that, subject to the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer may, at the election of the Collateral Manager, repay to the Liquidity Facility Provider, together with accrued interest thereon, such Liquidity Drawing on an earlier date from the amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Account pursuant to paragraph (9) of Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) to the extent possible. The “Repayment Date” in respect of any Liquidity Drawing shall be the Payment Date following the applicable Drawdown Date in respect of such Liquidity Drawing or, if applicable, any earlier date elected by the Collateral Manager for repayment of such Liquidity Drawing in accordance with the previous sentence, subject in the case of any Subsequent Drawdown to the provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Each Subsequent Drawdown made by the Issuer shall be applied in repayment (in whole or in part) of the related Initial Drawdown or, if applicable, any Subsequent Drawdown refinancing the same or refinancing any earlier Subsequent Drawdown. Any failure to repay any Liquidity Drawing on the Repayment Date related thereto due to there being insufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Account or Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds (respectively) shall not constitute a Liquidity Facility Event of Default unless such failure to repay occurs on the Final Repayment Date or at any time when the Available Commitment is zero.
Reduction of Available Commitment
On any Payment Date on which any of the Rated Notes are subject to a redemption (in whole or in part) in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Available Commitment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of:
(a) €1,500,000; and
(b) an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to:
(i) the difference between:
(A) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of the Rated Notes before any redemption and/or purchase by the Issuer in respect of any of the Rated Notes as at the previous Payment Date (excluding any Deferred Interest) by the Applicable Margin in respect of each Class of Rated Notes respectively; and
(B) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of the Rated Notes after any redemption and/or purchase by the Issuer in respect of any of the Rated Notes as at the previous Payment Date (excluding any Deferred Interest) by the Applicable Margin in respect of each Class of Rated Notes respectively; and
divided by

(ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of the Rated Notes as at their date of issuance by the Applicable Margin in respect of each Class of Rated Notes respectively as at their respective dates of issuance,
as at such Payment Date.
Renewal of initial Liquidity Facility Commitment Period
The Issuer or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer (copied in each case to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator) may deliver, not more than 30 nor fewer than 15 Business Days before the expiry of the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period, an irrevocable request that the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period be renewed (the “Initial Renewal Request”) to the Payment Date falling immediately before the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date. If the Liquidity Facility Provider in its sole and absolute discretion accepts the Initial Renewal Request, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf may deliver, not more than 30 nor fewer than 15 Business Days before the expiry of the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period (as extended), an irrevocable request that the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period (as extended) be renewed (the “Subsequent Renewal Request” and, together with the Initial Renewal Request, the “Renewal Requests”) to the Payment Date falling immediately before the sixth anniversary of the Issue Date.
If the Liquidity Facility Provider in its sole and absolute discretion wishes to accept such a request to extend the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period, it shall, not later than 10 days before expiry of the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period, deliver to the Issuer (copied to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator and KBRA) an irrevocable notice that it has consented to the request contained in the Renewal Request.
Interest on Drawings and Available Commitment
A commitment fee during the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period shall be payable by the Issuer equal to a rate of 1.0 per cent. per annum, on an amount equal to the Available Commitment accruing on each day during the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period.
Accrued and unpaid commitment fee on the Available Commitment shall be payable by the Issuer in arrear on each Payment Date to the extent that there are sufficient Interest Proceeds and, if required, Principal Proceeds or the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral, available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments or at any time in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Any accrued commitment fee is also payable to the Liquidity Facility Provider on the cancelled amount of the Commitment at and up to the time the cancellation takes effect.
The rate of interest on each loan made or to be made under the Liquidity Facility or deemed to be made under the Liquidity Facility (including any Initial Drawdown and/or Subsequent Drawdown) for each interest period is the rate per annum determined by the Liquidity Facility Provider to be the aggregate of (a) 2.50 per cent. per annum; and (b) EURIBOR (as defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement) for the relevant interest period.
Accrued interest on any Liquidity Drawing shall be payable on the Repayment Date in respect of such Liquidity Drawing and shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
Arrangement Fee
An arrangement fee will be payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date to the Liquidity Facility Provider in the amount of €15,000 (exclusive of any VAT thereon), provided that the Liquidity Facility Provider has provided an invoice for such amount to the Issuer two Business Days prior to the Issue Date, it will be a condition precedent to any Initial Drawdown that the arrangement fee has been paid by the Issuer.
Priority of Amounts Due to the Liquidity Facility Provider under the Liquidity Facility Agreement
Pursuant to the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and/or the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and/or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, interest and commitment fees due and payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement, together with the repayment of Liquidity Drawings will rank senior prior to all amounts payable in respect of the Notes. All other amounts payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement such as expenses, increased costs and indemnification amounts will constitute Administrative Expenses and as such will be payable prior to payment of any amounts in respect of the Notes but only to the extent that such amounts do not exceed the Senior Expenses Cap applicable to the relevant Payment Date (except to the extent that a Note Event of Default is continuing). All amounts payable in excess of such cap will be payable after payment of amongst other things (i) amounts payable in the event of an Effective Date Rating Event, (ii) amounts payable to the Principal Account for reinvestment or in redemption of the Notes upon breach of the Interest Diversion Test and (iii) Trustee Fees and Expenses not paid by reason of the Senior Expenses Cap.
Cancellation
The Commitment may only be cancelled by the Liquidity Facility Provider (in whole or in part) on or at any time
(a) after the occurrence of an event of default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement (a “Liquidity Facility Event of Default”) upon notice from the Liquidity Facility Provider to the Issuer. A Liquidity Facility Event of Default occurs if (i) the Issuer fails to pay any amount due under the Liquidity Facility Agreement on its due date provided that where any non-payment is a result of an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least seven Business Days after the Collateral Manager or the Issuer receives written notice, or has actual knowledge, of the administrative error or omission; (ii) the Notes are accelerated in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) and such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default); (iii) it is or it becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform any of its obligations under the Liquidity Facility Agreement; (iv) the Issuer becomes subject to insolvency proceedings; or (v) the Liquidity Facility Agreement is not or ceases to be in full force and effect and legal, valid, binding and enforceable or (b) it becomes unlawful for the Liquidity Facility Provider to give effect to any of its obligations as contemplated by the Liquidity Facility Agreement or fund or maintain any Liquidity Drawing, provided that prior to any such cancellation under paragraph (b), the Liquidity Facility Provider is obligated pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement to notify the Issuer accordingly (with such notices copied to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator).
Notwithstanding any such cancellations by the Liquidity Facility Provider, the repayment or prepayment of any existing Liquidity Drawings and interest thereon shall not be made until the following Payment Date or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
The Available Commitment may be cancelled at the option of the Issuer in whole or in part at any time upon no less than five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) to the Liquidity Facility Provider (copied to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator). No requests for Liquidity Drawings purporting to draw all or any part of the amount the subject of such notice of such cancellation may be made during such five Business Day notice period.
The Issuer may, without premium or penalty but subject to the payment of accrued interest and Break Costs (as such term is defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement), by notice to the Liquidity Facility Provider, cancel the whole of the Commitment at any time notice is given to the Noteholders in respect of the final redemption of the Notes pursuant to Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption) or if no such notice is forthcoming, on such redemption.
The Commitment may be cancelled in whole but not in part at the option of the Issuer but subject to payment of accrued interest and Break Costs (as such term is defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement) without consent of any party at any time upon no less than five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) to the Liquidity Facility Provider (copied to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator) if, pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to pay any additional amounts to the Liquidity Facility Provider in respect of the Liquidity Facility Provider’s tax liabilities or any amounts to the Liquidity Facility
Provider in respect of the Liquidity Facility Provider’s increased costs, provided that such notice may only be provided if the circumstances are continuing.
The Available Commitment will be automatically cancelled in full at close of business on the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date provided a Liquidity Drawing may be made on the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date (other than when the Liquidity Facility has been cancelled in its entirety in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement). Notwithstanding any such cancellation, any outstanding Liquidity Drawings and accrued interest thereon shall continue to be repayable in accordance with the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
Cancellation Timing
Notwithstanding the delivery of any notice requesting a voluntary cancellation of the Commitment in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement, no cancellation of the Commitment in whole pursuant thereto shall take effect until the following Payment Date.
Assignment
The Liquidity Facility Provider may transfer its interest under the Liquidity Facility Agreement provided certain conditions set out in the Liquidity Facility Agreement are satisfied and the prior consent of the Issuer, Collateral Manager and the Trustee is obtained and notice has been given to the Rating Agencies. The prior consent of the Issuer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and will be deemed to have been given if, within ten Business Days of receipt by the Issuer of a request for consent, it has not been expressly refused. No such consent is required from the Issuer if a Liquidity Facility Event of Default or a Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or the proposed assignment, transfer of novation is to an Affiliate of the Liquidity Facility Provider.
Replacement and Additional Liquidity Facilities
Under the Liquidity Facility Agreement the Issuer will covenant not to enter into additional liquidity facility arrangements at any time prior to the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date.
If a Replacement Liquidity Facility is to be entered into on or following the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date, it must be a condition of such Replacement Liquidity Facility that any outstanding Liquidity Drawings with the existing Liquidity Facility Provider will be repaid in full.
HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the hedging arrangements to be entered into by the Issuer on or about the Issue Date and thereafter. The following is a summary only and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive description of the detailed provisions of such documents (copies of which are available from the registered office of the Issuer). Any Hedge Agreement may include additional or different terms to those described below.

Hedge Agreements
Subject to (i) such arrangements at the time they are entered into satisfying the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria, or (ii) the receipt by the Collateral Manager of legal advice from a reputable legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Collateral Manager to register with the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor pursuant to the CEA, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into hedging transactions as described below and documented under a 1992 (Multicurrency—Cross Border) or 2002 Master Agreement or such other form published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). For the avoidance of doubt, an Asset Swap Agreement and an Interest Rate Hedge Agreement may be documented as one Hedge Agreement.
Form Approved Hedge Agreements
The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, shall provide at least 2 Business Days’ prior written notification to each Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes each time it enters into a Hedge Transaction in the form of a Form Approved Asset Swap or Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge.
“Form Approved Asset Swap” means an Asset Swap Transaction and the related Asset Swap Agreement, the documentation for and structure of which conforms (save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the name and financial aspects of the related Collateral Debt Obligation, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and any other consequential amendments in respect thereof required to reflect the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation) to a form for which Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has been received by the Issuer or which has been approved by the Rating Agencies from time to time provided that any form approved by the Rating Agencies prior to the Issue Date shall, unless otherwise notified to the Issuer by a Rating Agency, constitute a Form Approved Asset Swap.
“Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge” means an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction and the related Interest Rate Hedge Agreement, the documentation for and structure of which conforms (save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the applicable floating rate index, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and any other consequential amendments in respect thereof required to reflect the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation) to a form for which Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has been received by the Issuer or which has been approved by the Rating Agencies from time to time provided that any form approved by the Rating Agencies prior to the Issue Date shall, unless otherwise notified to the Issuer by a Rating Agency, constitute a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge.
Currency Hedging Arrangements

Asset Swap Agreements

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase Non-Euro Obligations provided that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, for any Non-Euro Obligation, enters into an Asset Swap Transaction with an Asset Swap Counterparty no later than (i) if such Non-Euro Obligation is denominated in a Qualifying Unhedged Obligation Currency within 90 days of the settlement date of acquisition thereof and
(ii) otherwise, the settlement date thereof, pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made in connection with funding the Issuer’s acquisition of the related Non-Euro Obligation and the final and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.
Transactions entered into under an Asset Swap Agreement are documented in confirmations to such Asset Swap Agreement. Each transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to an Asset Swap Agreement (each an “Asset Swap Transaction”). An Asset Swap Transaction, if entered into, will be:
(a) used to hedge the currency (and if applicable, interest rate) mismatch between the Notes and any Non- Euro Obligations;
(b) in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to delivery of prior written notice to the Rating Agencies in respect thereof; and
(c) other than in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof.
Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or about the date of such sale in accordance with its terms, resulting in either (i) the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Asset Swap Obligation from the Issuer (which shall be funded outside the Priorities of Payments from the Non-Euro Hedge Account) and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the definition thereof) to the Issuer or (ii) the Issuer retaining the proceeds of sale of the Asset Swap Obligation (which shall be converted into Euro and paid into the Principal Account in accordance with the Conditions) net of any payments due to the Asset Swap Counterparty in connection with the termination of the Asset Swap Transaction in such circumstances (which the Issuer shall pay to the Asset Swap Counterparty on the date such payment is due in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement). Furthermore, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Hedge Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, in which case any Asset Swap Termination Payment would be paid in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be returned to an Asset Swap Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payments in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement) and Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts).
If, following the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes, the Hedge Counterparty elects not to early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, the Asset Swap Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the relevant Asset Swap Obligation, resulting in the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Asset Swap Obligation from the Issuer and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the definition thereof) to the Issuer. An Asset Swap Transaction may also terminate in accordance with its terms upon repayment in full of the related Asset Swap Obligation and related final exchange under such Asset Swap Transaction.
Replacement Asset Swap Transactions

In the event that any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each as defined in the applicable Asset Swap Agreement) the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction within 30 days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies, among other things, the applicable Rating Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
In the event of termination of an Asset Swap Transaction in the circumstances referred to above, any Asset Swap Termination Receipt will be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and shall be applied towards the costs of entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, together with, where necessary, Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that are available for such purpose on any Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payments, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation, save:
(a) where the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, determines not to replace such Asset Swap Transaction and Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation is received in respect of such determination; or
(b) where termination of the Asset Swap Transaction occurs on a Redemption Date pursuant to Conditions 7(a) (Final Redemption), 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (other than in connection with a Refinancing), 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or 10(a) (Note Events of Default); or
(c) to the extent that such Asset Swap Termination Receipt is not required for application towards any Asset Swap Replacement Payment,
in which event such Asset Swap Termination Receipt shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
In the event that the Issuer receives any Asset Swap Replacement Receipt upon entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, such amount shall be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and applied directly by the Collateral Administrator acting on the instructions of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in payment of any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable upon termination of the Asset Swap Transaction being so replaced. To the extent not fully paid out of Asset Swap Replacement Receipts, any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable by the Issuer shall be paid to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty on the next Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments. To the extent not required for making any such Asset Swap Termination Payment, such Asset Swap Replacement Receipts shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
Subject to sub-paragraph (a) above, in the event that a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction cannot be entered into in such circumstances, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell the applicable Non- Euro Obligation, pay the proceeds thereof to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty, to the extent required pursuant to the terms of such Asset Swap Transaction and/or to the extent not so required, shall direct the Collateral Administrator to convert all of such proceeds into Euro at the Applicable Exchange Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account. In the event that such proceeds are insufficient to pay any Asset Swap Termination Payments in full, such amount, including any Defaulted Hedge Termination Payment, shall be paid out of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds on the next following Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into any additional Interest Rate Hedge Transactions from time to time in order to hedge any interest rate mismatch between the Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes) and the Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof and provided that the Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement.
Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

In the event that an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each such term as defined in the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Agreement), the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within 30 days of termination thereof with an Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies the applicable Ratings Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria

The Collateral Manager shall only cause the Issuer to enter into a Hedge Agreement that (i) at the time such Hedge Agreement is entered into, satisfies the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) in respect of which, the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer or Collateral Manager to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.
If a responsible representative of the Collateral Manager with knowledge of the Portfolio has actual knowledge of any change in law or regulation that would lead him or her to reasonably question the viability of the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria mentioned above, the Collateral Manager shall cause the Issuer to seek written legal advice in respect of such Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria. If the Collateral Manager cannot obtain such advice it shall not cause the Issuer to enter into any further Hedge Agreements unless in respect of any such further Hedge Agreement it obtains written legal advice of reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not cause the Issuer or Collateral Manager to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.
Notwithstanding anything in the Collateral Management Agreement or the Trust Deed to the contrary, the Collateral Manager may unilaterally elect to modify the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria without the consent of any other party so long as it causes the Issuer to obtain an opinion from reputable legal counsel that Hedge Agreements entered into in compliance with such modified Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria will not cause the Issuer or Collateral Manager to be required to register as a CPO with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, if, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Manager, entry into a Hedge Agreement would require registration of the Collateral Manager under the CEA, the Issuer will not be permitted to enter into such Hedge Agreement unless such registration is made by the Collateral Manager with respect to, and at the expense of, the Issuer.
In the Collateral Management Agreement, Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria means, at the time a Hedge Transaction is entered into, each of the following is true:
(a) the relevant Hedge Transaction is an interest rate swap or cross currency swap transaction (or both) and is being entered into solely to hedge interest rate risk, timing mismatch or currency risk (or any combination of these) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;
(b) the relevant Hedge Transaction relates to a single Collateral Debt Obligation only, although multiple Hedge Transactions with the same counterparty may be entered into under a single master hedge agreement;
(c) the relevant Hedge Transaction does not change the tenor of the subject matter of the Collateral Debt Obligation;
(d) the relevant Hedge Transaction does not leverage exposure to the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation or otherwise inject leverage into the Issuer’s exposure;
(e) other than with respect to introducing credit risk exposure to the counterparty on the Hedge Agreement, the relevant Hedge Transaction does not change the Issuer’s credit risk exposure to the Obligor on the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;
(f) the relevant Hedge Transaction is documented pursuant to an ISDA Master Agreement, including pursuant to a confirmation for each Hedge Transaction thereunder;
(g) payment dates under the relevant Hedge Transaction correspond to or occur on or about Payment Dates or the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation payment dates;
(h) the notional amount of the relevant Hedge Transaction will decline in line with the principal amount of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;
(i) in the Collateral Manager’s view, in the context of the transaction as a whole, the relevant Hedge Transaction will not change the Noteholders’ investment experience in any material way by virtue thereof; and
(j) either (i) the relevant Hedge Transaction must terminate automatically in whole or in part (as applicable) when the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation is sold or matures; or (ii) the Issuer must have the right to terminate the relevant Hedge Transaction in whole or in part (as applicable) when the subject matter Collateral Debt Obligation is sold or matures and at the time the relevant Hedge Transaction is entered into the Collateral Manager intends to cause the Issuer to exercise such right.
Interest Rate Cap Transactions
On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer may enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions which are interest rate caps (“Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions”). The Issuer will have no payment obligations in respect of any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions other than the payment of a premium in respect of each such transaction to the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty upon entry into such transactions.
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall exercise any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction on any Business Day when EURIBOR is greater than the strike price set out in the applicable Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) shall not sell or transfer any Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction other than in circumstances where Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has been obtained from each Rating Agency in respect of any such sale or transfer.
Standard Terms of the Hedge Agreements
Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is (a) agreed by the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty and (b)(i) subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof or (ii) included in a Form Approved Asset Swap.
Gross up
Under each Hedge Agreement neither the Issuer nor the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Any such event may however result in a “Tax Event” which is a “Termination Event” for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. In the event of the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement), each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the “Affected Party” (as defined therein), where the Hedge Counterparty is the “Affected Party”, to use reasonable endeavours to (i) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty thereto) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all “Transactions” (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (ii) (in the case of the Issuer) transfer its residence for tax purposes to another jurisdiction, or if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation).
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition
The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payments set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payments), provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. The Issuer will have the benefit of limited recourse and non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).
Termination Provisions
Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the occurrence of a number of events (which may include without limitation):
(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account the applicable grace period;
(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or to perform its obligations under, any applicable Hedge Agreement;
(d) the principal due in respect of the Notes is declared to be due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed;
(e) failure by a Hedge Counterparty to comply with the requirements of the Rating Agencies in the event that it (or, in the context of an Asset Swap Counterparty whose obligations are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement;
(f) the Notes are redeemed in whole prior to the Maturity Date (otherwise than as a result of a Note Event of Default thereunder);
(g) representations related to certain regulatory matters prove to be incorrect;
(h) if the Issuer becomes subject to the AIFMD, or if the Issuer or the Collateral Manager is required to register as a “commodity pool operator” and such party does not so register pursuant to the CEA or certain representations relating to EMIR prove to be incorrect;
(i) other regulatory changes or changes to the regulatory status of the Issuer occur (each as further described in the relevant Hedge Agreement);
(j) an amendment is made to any provision of the Transaction Documents without the consent of a Hedge Counterparty which could have a material adverse effect on the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty; and
(k) any other event as specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement.
A termination of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction does not constitute a Note Event of Default under the Notes though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an additional termination event under a Hedge Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or Termination Event (each as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement), a Hedge Agreement may be terminated by the Hedge Counterparty or the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with the detailed provisions thereof and a lump sum (the “Termination Payment”) may become payable by the Issuer to the applicable Hedge Counterparty or vice versa. Depending on the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement, such Termination Payment may be determined by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and/or Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) by reference to market quotations obtained in respect of the entry into a replacement swap(s) on the same terms as that terminated or as otherwise described in the applicable Hedge Agreement or, subject and in accordance with the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement, any loss suffered by a party.
Asset Swap Agreements may also contain provisions which allow an Asset Swap Transaction to terminate upon the occurrence of certain credit events related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These credit events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Debt Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation (as such term is defined in the Conditions). In such instances the related Asset Swap Transaction would terminate and the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) may need to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation unless a new Asset Swap Transaction can be entered into.
Rating Downgrade Requirements
Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies for the type of derivative transaction described in this Offering Circular in the event of the downgrade or withdrawal of the Hedge Counterparty’s rating (or, if applicable, its guarantor’s) to below the applicable Rating Requirement. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty downgraded below certain minimum levels consistent with the ratings of the Notes must post collateral; or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity meeting the applicable Rating Requirement (or, as relevant, whose guarantor meets the applicable Rating Requirement); or procure that an eligible guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement; or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation.
Transfer and Modification
The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Asset Swap or a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge (as applicable) following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement.
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.
Governing Law
Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder in each case, including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data
The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time enter into agreements (each a “Reporting Delegation Agreement”) in a form approved by the Rating Agencies for the delegation of certain derivative transaction reporting obligations to one or more Hedge Counterparties or third parties (each, in such capacity, a “Reporting Delegate”).
TAX CONSIDERATIONS

General
Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.
Potential purchasers who are in any doubt about their tax position on purchase, ownership, transfer or exercise of any Note should consult their own tax advisers. In particular, no representation is made as to the manner in which payments under the Notes would be characterised by any relevant taxing authority. Potential investors should be aware that the relevant fiscal rules or their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, and that this summary is not exhaustive. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice or a guarantee to any potential investor of the tax consequences of investing in the Notes.
Irish Taxation
The following is a summary of the principal Irish tax consequences for individuals and companies of ownership of the Notes based on the laws and practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners currently in force in Ireland and may be subject to change. It deals with Noteholders who beneficially own their Notes as an investment. Particular rules not discussed below may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding Notes, such as dealers in securities, trusts etc. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. This summary does not address the tax consequences of a Contribution for a Contributor or any Noteholder. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and the receipt of interest thereon under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship or domicile.
Unless otherwise provided below, references in this section to the “EU” and its “Member States” shall not be interpreted so as to include the UK.
Withholding Tax

In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.), is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest which should include interest payable on the Notes.
The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note so long as interest paid on the relevant Note does not come within certain rules introduced by the Finance Act 2016 and Finance Act 2017 (as described below under the heading Deductibility of Interest) and falls within one of the following categories:
1. Interest paid on a quoted Eurobond:

The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note where:
(a) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds i.e. securities which are issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are listed on a recognised stock exchange (such as the Global Exchange Market) and which carry a right to interest; and
(b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland, or if such person is in Ireland, either:
(i) the Notes are held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are, amongst others, so recognised); or
(ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the Notes and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland) in the prescribed form; and
(c) one of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) the Noteholder is resident for tax purposes in Ireland; or
(ii) the Noteholder is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, premium or other distribution, to a tax in a relevant territory which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory; or
(iii) the Noteholder is not a Specified Person; or
(iv) at the time of issue of the Notes, the Issuer was not in possession, or aware, of any information which could reasonably be taken to indicate whether or not the beneficial owner of the Notes would be subject to tax on any interest payments,
where the term:
“relevant territory” means a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a country with which Ireland has signed a double tax treaty (“Relevant Territory”); and
“swap agreement” means any agreement, arrangement or understanding that:
(i) provides for the exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of one or more payments based on the value, rate or amount of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof, and
(ii) transfers to a person who is a party to the agreement, arrangement or understanding or to a person connected with that person, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value, rate or amount without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset (including any enterprise or investment pool) or liability that incorporates the financial risk so transferred.
“Specified Person” means a person who is either:
(i) a person which is a company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer or which is controlled by a third company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer (where control is determined in accordance with the provisions discussed below) or
(ii) a person (including any connected persons):
(A) from whom the Issuer has acquired assets,
(B) to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances,
(C) to whom loans or advances held by the Issuer were made; or
(D) with whom the Issuer has entered into a return agreement (as defined in section 110(1) TCA),
where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or agreements represents 75% or more of the assets of the Issuer;
A person will have control of a company in this context if they have the ability to secure, through shares, voting power or the constitutional documents, that the affairs of the company are conducted in accordance with their wishes. A person will also have control of the Issuer if they have:
(i) an ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the Issuer (a “significant influence”); and
(ii) hold more than 20% of any of (i) the share capital of the Issuer, (ii) the principal value of any securities which carry a right to interest or distributions which are to any extent dependent on the results of the Issuer's business or exceed a reasonable commercial rate (iii) the right to more than 20% of the interest payable on securities described at (ii).
Thus, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on the Global Exchange Market, are held in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c) above is met, interest
on the Notes can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognised clearing system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside Ireland and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c) above is met.
2. Interest paid by a qualifying company to certain non-residents:

If, for any reason, the exemption referred to above ceases to apply, interest payments may still be made free of withholding tax provided that:
(a) the Issuer remains a “qualifying company” as defined in Section 110 of the TCA and the Noteholder is a person which is resident in a Relevant Territory, and, where the recipient is a body corporate, the interest is not paid to it in connection with a trade or business carried on by it in Ireland through a branch or agency. The test of residence is determined by reference to the law of the Relevant Territory in which the Noteholder claims to be resident. The Issuer must be satisfied that the terms of the exemption are satisfied; and
(b) one of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) the Noteholder is a pension fund, government body or other person which is resident in a Relevant Territory and which, under the laws of that territory, is exempted from tax that corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains in that territory and which is not a Specified Person; or
(ii) the interest is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, to a tax in a Relevant Territory which corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory.
Deductibility of Interest

Rules contained in the Finance Act 2016 and Finance Act 2017 restrict the deductibility of interest paid by a qualifying company (such as the Issuer) that is profit dependent or exceeds a reasonable commercial return to the extent that the interest is associated with a ‘specified property business’ carried on by that qualifying company. A ‘specified property business’ of a qualifying company means, subject to a number of exceptions, a business of holding ‘specified mortgages’, units in an IREF (being a specified form of investment undertaking within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA) or shares that derive their value or the greater part of their value, directly or indirectly, from Irish land. A ‘specified mortgage’ for this purpose is (a) a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land, (b) a ‘specified agreement’ (effectively a profit dependent derivative) which derives its value, or the greater part of its value, directly or indirectly, from Irish land or a loan to which (a) applies, or (c) the portion of a specified security (essentially a security in respect of which, if the Finance Act 2016 and Finance Act 2017 rules did not apply to it, payments on that security would be deductible under section 110 of the TCA), is attributable to the specified property business in accordance with the rules, or (d) units in an IREF (being a specified form of investment undertaking within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA).
The legislation treats the holding of such assets as a separate business to the rest of the qualifying company’s activities. The qualifying company is taxed on any profit that is attributable to that business at 25% and any such interest that is profit dependent or exceeds a reasonable commercial return, subject to a number of exceptions, is not deductible and potentially subject to Irish withholding tax at 20%.
There is a specific carve out from these rules in respect of CLO transactions, provided the transaction is carried out in conformity with:
(a) a prospectus, within the meaning of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as may be amended or superseded);
(b) listing particulars, where any securities issued by the qualifying company are listed on an exchange, other than the main exchange, in Ireland or another EU or EEA Member State (“relevant Member State”); or
(c) where the securities issued by the qualifying company will not be listed on an exchange in Ireland or a relevant Member State, legally binding documents,
that:
‎
(i) may provide for a warehousing period, which for the purposes of this carve-out means a period not exceeding 3 years during which time the qualifying company is preparing to issue securities; and
(ii) provide for investment eligibility criteria that govern the type and quality of assets to be acquired,
(iii) and where, based on the documents referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) and the activities of the qualifying company, it would not be reasonable to consider that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the qualifying company was to acquire specified mortgages.
Accordingly, on the basis that this document will constitute ‘listing particulars’ (see above) and of a confirmation in the Collateral Management Agreement that neither the Issuer nor the Collateral Manager has as its main purpose, or one of its main purposes, the acquisition of ‘specified mortgages’ within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA, the rules in the Finance Act 2016 and Finance Act 2017 should not apply to this transaction.
Encashment Tax

Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.
Income Tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge

Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax, the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish tax with respect to such interest. Noteholders resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland who are individuals may be liable to pay Irish income tax, social insurance (PRSI) contributions and the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.
Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore may be within the charge to Irish income tax, notwithstanding that the Noteholder is not resident in Ireland. In the case of Noteholders who are non-resident individuals such Noteholders may also be liable to pay the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.
Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of tax and any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within its scope.
There are a number of exemptions from Irish income tax available to certain non-residents. Firstly, interest payments made by the Issuer are exempt from income tax so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA, the recipient is not resident in Ireland and is resident in a Relevant Territory and, the interest is paid out of the assets of the Issuer. Secondly, interest payments made by the Issuer in the ordinary course of its trade or business to a company are exempt from income tax provided the recipient company is not resident in Ireland and is either resident for tax purposes in a Relevant Territory which imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside that territory or the interest is exempted from the charge to Irish income tax under the terms of a double tax agreement which is either in force or which will come into force once all ratification procedures have been completed. Thirdly, interest paid by the Issuer free of withholding tax under the quoted Eurobond exemption is exempt from income tax where the recipient is a person not resident in Ireland and resident in a relevant territory or is a company which is under the control, whether directly or indirectly, of person(s) who by virtue of the law of a relevant territory are resident for the purposes of tax in a relevant territory and is not under the control of person(s) who are not so resident or is a company where the principal class of shares of the company or its 75% parent is substantially and regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange. For the purpose of these exemptions and where not specified otherwise, residence is determined under the terms of the relevant double taxation agreement or, in any other case, the law of the country in which the recipient claims to be resident. Interest falling within the above exemptions is also exempt from the universal social charge.
Notwithstanding these exemptions from income tax, a corporate recipient that carries on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes are held or attributed, may have a liability to Irish corporation tax on the interest.
Relief from Irish income tax may also be available under the specific provisions of a double tax treaty between Ireland and the country of residence of the recipient.
Interest on the Notes which does not fall within the above exemptions is within the charge to income tax, and, in the case of Noteholders who are individuals, the charge to the universal social charge. In the past the Irish Revenue Commissioners have not pursued liability to income tax in respect of persons who are not regarded as being resident in Ireland except where such persons have a taxable presence of some sort in Ireland or seek to claim any relief or repayment in respect of Irish tax. However, there can be no assurance that the Irish Revenue Commissioners will apply this treatment in the case of any Noteholder.
Capital Gains Tax

A holder of Notes will not be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of Notes unless (i) such holder is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland or (ii) such holder carries on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes were used or held or (iii) the Notes cease to be listed on a stock exchange in circumstances where the Notes derive their value or more than 50% of their value from Irish real estate, mineral rights or exploration rights.
Capital Acquisitions Tax

A gift or inheritance comprising Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax (which subject to available exemptions and reliefs, is currently levied at 33 per cent) if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) on the relevant date or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland (i.e. if the Notes are physically located in Ireland or if the register of the Notes is maintained in Ireland).
Stamp Duty

No stamp duty or similar tax is imposed in Ireland (on the basis of an exemption provided for in Section 85(2)(c) of the Irish Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999 so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA and the proceeds of the Notes are used in the course of the Issuer’s business), on the issue, transfer or redemption of the Notes.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

General

The following discussion summarises certain of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of Notes.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States, for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 an estate, whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions.
For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 a non resident alien individual for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 an estate whose income is not subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis; or
 a trust if no court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration or if no United States persons have the authority to control any of its substantial decisions.
An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).
This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes for cash at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors)) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes. Finally, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of a Contribution to a Contributor.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer
The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Paul Hastings LLP to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management Agreement, including certain investment guidelines referenced therein (the “Investment Restrictions”), and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the Investment Restrictions or the Trust Deed may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Investment Restrictions permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Investment Restrictions will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the opinion of Paul Hastings LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
If it were determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer would be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on such effectively connected taxable income (computed possibly without any allowance for deductions) and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such taxes on the Issuer would materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes
Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer intends to treat each Class of the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules relating to U.S. equity owners in PFICs or CFCs. See “—U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes—Possible Treatment of Class E Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes” below. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees or will be deemed to agree to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
This discussion, and the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP described above, do not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes

Class A Notes and Class B Notes

Stated Interest. U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes will include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest accrued or received on their Notes, in accordance with their usual method of tax accounting, as ordinary interest income.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the cash method of accounting will calculate the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the time a payment is received.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the accrual method of accounting or that otherwise are required to accrue stated interest before receipt will calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of Class A Notes or Class B Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are
received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of such payments when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Original Issue Discount. In addition, if the discount at which a substantial amount of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes is first sold to investors is at least 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of the Class, multiplied by the number of complete years to the weighted average maturity of the Class, then the Issuer will treat the Class as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Note within the Class will equal the excess of the principal amount of the Note over its issue price (the price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the Class was first sold to investors). U.S. Holders of Rated Notes that are issued with OID will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders of the Class A Notes or Class B Notes will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a
U.S. Holder of the Class A Notes or Class B Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the
U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes that are issued with OID also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of principal payments on their Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange, or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in its Rated Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by the U.S. dollar value of any amount includable in income as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of payments of principal on such Rated Note (based, in the case of a Class A Note or a Class B Note, on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received).
A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class A Note or Class B Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Rated Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Rated Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class A Note or Class B Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement (less any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above) and the holder’s tax basis in such Rated Note. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Rated Notes are treated under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S.
dollar value of the principal amount of the Rated Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Rated Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Rated Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
Class C Notes, Class D Notes, and Class E Notes

Original Issue Discount. The Issuer will treat the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, and Class E Notes as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Class C Note, Class D Note or Class E Note will equal the sum of all payments to be received under such Note less its issue price (the price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the applicable Class was first sold to investors). U.S. Holders of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, or Class E Notes will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder can elect to calculate the
U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five Business Days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder of Class C Notes, Class D Notes or Class E Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, and Class E Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, or Class E Notes should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class C Notes, Class D Notes or Class E Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest and/or principal payments on their Rated Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange, or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder of a Class C Note, Class D Note or Class E Note will have a basis in such Rated Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Rated Note (based on the euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Rated Note if the Rated Note is treated under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by any amount includable in income by such U.S. Holder as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the
U.S. dollar value of any payments received on such Rated Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received). A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class C Note, Class D Note or Class E prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Rated Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Rated Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Rated Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class C Note, Class D Note or Class E Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement and the holder’s tax basis in such Rated Note. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Rated Note was acquired). The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
The Designation of an Alternative Base Rate

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the designation of an Alternative Base Rate is unclear. If the designation of an Alternative Base Rate is treated as a “significant modification” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the designation an Alternative Base Rate could cause a U.S. Holder that holds Rated Notes that are subject to the designation an Alternative Base Rate to recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between (a)(i) the fair market value of the modified Rated Notes (if, as expected, the Class is treated as publicly traded) or their principal amount (if the Class is not treated as publicly traded), less (ii) any accrued and unpaid interest (which will be taxable as such), and (b) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Rated Notes. Any gain will be long-term capital gain if the applicable Rated Notes were held for more than one year at the time of the designation of an Alternative Base Rate, or otherwise short-term capital gain. The tax on any such gain may exceed the after-tax distributions on the modified Rated Notes during the taxable year in which the designation of an Alternative Base Rate occurs, in which case the U.S. Holder would be required to fund its tax liability in respect of the gain from other sources. In the event that the designation of an Alternative Base Rate is treated as a significant modification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that the U.S. Holder’s holding period in respect of the modified Rated Notes will begin on the day following the modification. U.S. Holders may not be permitted to recognize loss upon a designation of an Alternative Base Rate. Finally, the designation of an Alternative Base Rate could create or change the amount of any OID that U.S. Holders are required to include with respect to their Rated Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the designation of an Alternative Base Rate.
Alternative Characterisation

It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Holder’s OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
Receipt of Euro

U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Possible Treatment of Class E Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes

As described above under “—U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes,” the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and
franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the Class E Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer will be a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain on the sale of the Class E Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on such Rated Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Holder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by writing “Protective QEF Election” on the top of an IRS Form 8621, filling out the form, checking Box A (Election to Treat the PFIC as a QEF) and filing the form with the IRS with respect to their Class E Notes, or by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Holder’s ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a “qualified electing fund” (a “QEF”) and so electing at the appropriate time. Such a U.S. Holder also will be required to file an annual PFIC report. The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the expense of the requesting U.S. Holder, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Class E Notes making a “protective” QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Alternatively, if the Class E Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”), and a U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes—Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” with respect to its Class E Notes.
If the Issuer holds a Collateral Debt Obligation that is treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and if the Class E Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, U.S. Holders of Class E Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
In addition, if the Class E Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 926 with respect to their Class E Notes.
Finally, if the Class E Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the IRS if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 5471 with respect to their Class E Notes.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. Prospective U.S. Holders of Class E Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding whether to make protective filings of IRS Forms 8621, 926 and 5471 with respect to such Notes and the consequences to them if the Class E Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes
Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. The Issuer will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be subject to the PFIC rules, except for certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC (as described below under “—Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”). U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should consider making an election to treat the Issuer as a QEF. Generally, a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election on IRS Form 8621, attaching a copy of that form to its U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it held its Subordinated Notes. If a U.S. Holder makes
a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. Because there is more than one class of Subordinated Notes, a U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain may exceed the amounts payable to the U.S. Holder on the Subordinated Notes during one or more taxable years. A
U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.
In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute all of its earnings in a taxable year, the electing U.S. Holder may also be permitted to elect to defer payment of some or all of the taxes on the QEF’s income, subject to an interest charge (which is nondeductible to individuals) on the deferred amount. In this regard, prospective purchasers of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is expected that the Collateral Debt Obligations will include high-yield debt obligations and such instruments may have substantial OID, the cash payment of which may be deferred, perhaps for a substantial period of time. In addition, the Issuer may use proceeds from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations to retire other classes of Notes. As a result, in any given year, the Issuer may have substantial amounts of earnings for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are not distributed on the Subordinated Notes. Thus, absent an election to defer payment of taxes, U.S. Holders that make a QEF election with respect to the Issuer may owe tax on significant “phantom” income.
The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (other than certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC, described below) that does not make a timely QEF election will be required to report the U.S. dollar value of any gain on the disposition of its Subordinated Notes as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, and to compute the tax liability on such gain and any “Excess Distribution” (as defined below) received in respect of the Subordinated Notes as if such items had been earned ratably over each day in the U.S. Holder’s holding period (or a certain portion thereof) for the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. Holder will be subject to tax on such gain or Excess Distributions at the highest ordinary income tax rate for each taxable year in which such gain or Excess Distributions are treated as having been earned, other than the current year (for which the U.S. Holder’s regular ordinary income tax rate will apply), regardless of the rate otherwise applicable to the U.S. Holder. Further, such
U.S. Holder will also be liable for an interest charge (which is nondeductible to individuals) as if such income tax liabilities had been due with respect to each such year. For purposes of these rules, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganisations and use of the Subordinated Notes as security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions of such Subordinated Notes. In addition, a stepped-up basis in the Subordinated Notes will not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. Holder who has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer.
An “Excess Distribution” is the amount by which the U.S. dollar value of distributions during a taxable year in respect of a Note exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions in respect thereof during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Note).
In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made. A U.S. HOLDER OF SUBORDINATED NOTES SHOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER MAKING A QEF ELECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER.
Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Issuer will be a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the equity interests in the Issuer, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by 10 per cent. United States shareholders. For this purpose, a “10 per cent. United States shareholder” is any United States person that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of equity in the Issuer. Thus, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (and/or any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) possessing directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and, if applicable, any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) would be treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), determined with respect to the combined voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and, if applicable, any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such 10 per cent. United States shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. If, for any given taxable year, the Issuer is treated as a CFC, a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer will be required to include as ordinary income an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of that person’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s “subpart F income” at the end of such taxable year. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income. In general, for purposes of determining a 10 per cent. United States shareholder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s subpart F income, the amount of the Issuer’s subpart F income attributable to each class of Subordinated Notes will be the amount that bears the same ratio to the Issuer’s total subpart F income as (1) the earnings and profits that would be distributed with respect to that class if all of the Issuer’s earnings and profits were distributed on the last day of the Issuer’s taxable year on which the Issuer is a CFC bear to (2) the Issuer’s total earnings and profits for that taxable year.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Holder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the “qualified portion” of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Holder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Holder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified portion and has not made a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In that case, the Issuer will again be treated as a PFIC which is not a QEF with respect to the U.S. Holder and the beginning of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will continue to be the date upon which the U.S. Holder acquired the Subordinated Notes, unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to recognise gain with respect to the Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, the Issuer will provide the information necessary for the U.S. Holder to comply with any filing requirements that arise as a result of the Issuer’s classification as a CFC.
Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs. If the Issuer owns a Collateral Debt Obligation that is treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences.
In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The
U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC, and thus there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Debt Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.
If a Collateral Debt Obligation is treated as an indirect equity interest in a CFC and a U.S. Holder owns directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the CFC’s voting power or value for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the U.S. Holder generally will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” as ordinary income at the end of each taxable year, as described above under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation,” regardless of whether the CFC distributed any amounts to the Issuer during such taxable year or whether the U.S. Holder made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held CFC. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of the CFC, and the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (as described below), generally will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, reduced by any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax issues associated with such investments in light of their own individual circumstances.
Phantom Income. U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the amounts that exceed the distributions they receive on the Subordinated Notes. For example, if the Issuer is a CFC and a U.S. Holder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, or a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the U.S. Holder will be subject to federal income tax with respect to its share of the Issuer’s income and gain (to the extent of the Issuer’s “earnings and profits”), which may exceed the Issuer’s distributions. It is expected that the Issuer’s income and gain (and earnings and profits) will exceed cash distributions with respect to (i) debt instruments that were issued with OID and are held by the Issuer or (ii) the acquisition at a discount of the Rated Notes by the Issuer (including by reason of a Refinancing or any deemed exchange that occurs for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a modification of the Trust Deed). U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the timing of income and gain on the Subordinated Notes.
Distributions. The treatment of actual distributions of cash on the Subordinated Notes will vary depending on whether the U.S. Holder of such Subordinated Notes has made a timely QEF election (as described above). See “—Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company.” If a timely QEF election has been made, distributions should be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) and to this extent will not be taxable to such U.S. Holder. Distributions in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes (as described below under “—Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”), and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, a U.S. Holder will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the distribution on the date received and the U.S. dollar value of the previously taxed amount. Any exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss.
If a U.S. Holder has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer then, except to the extent that distributions are attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules, some or all of any distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes may constitute Excess Distributions, taxable as described above under the heading “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company.” Distributions that do not constitute Excess Distributions will be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income upon receipt to the extent of untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer. Distributions that do not constitute Excess Distributions and are in excess of untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes, and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge, as described below under “—Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”.
Distributions on the Subordinated Notes will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and will not qualify as “qualified dividend income.”
Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition. In general, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes will recognise gain or loss upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes (including a distribution that is treated as a disposition of the Subordinated Notes, as described above under “Distributions”) equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Subordinated Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year.
A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its Subordinated Notes initially will equal the U.S. dollar value of the amount paid by the U.S. Holder for the Subordinated Notes, determined under rules analogous to the rules for determining the
U.S. dollar value of the amount realised. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Holder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a nontaxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.
If the U.S. Holder has made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, then, except to the extent that the Issuer is treated as a CFC and the U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, gain or loss upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election from the date of each deemed distribution pursuant to the election (based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the applicable tax year) to the date of the disposition. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Subordinated Notes for more than one year at the time of the disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
If a U.S. Holder does not make a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer as described above and is not subject to the CFC rules, any gain realised on the sale, redemption, or other disposition of a Subordinated Note (or any gain deemed to accrue prior to the time a non-timely QEF election is made) will be taxed as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge under the special tax rules described above. See “—Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company.”
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, then any gain or loss realised by the U.S. Holder upon a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes, other than gain or loss subject to the PFIC rules, if applicable, generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules from the date of each deemed distribution pursuant to the CFC rules (based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the applicable taxable year) to the date of the disposition. Any gain in excess of foreign currency exchange gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s previously untaxed earnings and profits.
In addition, as described above under “—Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs,” the U.S. dollar value of any gain attributable to interests in PFICs or CFCs owned by the Issuer may be treated as ordinary income to a U.S. Holder upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the U.S. Holder’s Subordinated Notes.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC, in certain cases, a corporate U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer may be eligible for a dividends received deduction to the extent any gain recognized on the disposition of a Subordinated Note is treated as ordinary income, or to the extent that such 10 per cent. United States shareholder receives a distribution that is treated as a dividend in the year in which it disposes of a Subordinated Note, in each case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of any dividends received deduction and the impact of such dividends received deduction on any such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Subordinated Notes.
Receipt of Euro. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Transfer and Information Reporting Requirements. A U.S. Holder that purchases the Subordinated Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such transfer exceeds $100,000.
A U.S. Holder that is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to file an information return on IRS
Form 5471, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes generally will be required to file an annual PFIC report.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers with respect to these or any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Subordinated Notes.
Specified Foreign Financial Asset Reporting
Certain U.S. Holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other “specified foreign financial assets” (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds $50,000. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.
3.8 per cent. Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income”
U.S. Holders that are individuals or estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. tax on net investment income is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax and special rules apply with respect to the PFIC and CFC rules described above. U.S. Holders should consult their advisers with respect to the 3.8 per cent. tax on net investment income.
FBAR Reporting
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Holder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer’s outstanding equity.
Reportable Transactions
A participant in a “reportable transaction” is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisers with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders of the Notes
In general, payments on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to
U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such Non-U.S. Holder is a non resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Under certain circumstances, the Code requires “information reporting” annually to the IRS and to each holder, and “backup withholding”, with respect to certain payments made on or with respect to the Notes. Backup withholding will apply to a U.S. Holder only if the U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its Taxpayer Identification
Number (“TIN”) which, for an individual, would be his or her Social Security Number, (ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report payments of interest and dividends, or (iv) under certain circumstances, fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments. The exemption generally is available to U.S. Holders that provide a properly completed IRS Form W- 9.
A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding.
Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of Notes made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be refunded (or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any), provided that certain required information is furnished. The information reporting requirements may apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Copies of the information returns also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing legislation that will require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to taxing authorities in Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer expects to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the implementing legislation. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Changes Affecting Noteholders
Future legislation, regulations, rulings or other authority could affect the federal income tax treatment of the Issuer and Noteholders. The Issuer cannot predict whether and to what extent any such legislative or administrative changes could change the tax consequences to the Issuer and to the Noteholders. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisers regarding possible legislative and administrative changes and their effect on the federal tax treatment of the Issuer and their investment in the Notes.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” subject thereto on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification and investments being made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and so-called “Keogh” plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest” and each a “Party in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under Federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3 101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, the “Plan Asset Regulation”), if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company,” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.
If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their exposure to liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes may and the Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each of the Class E
Notes, the Class M-1 Subordinated Notes and the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, Class M-1 Subordinated Notes and Class M-2 Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note or a Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor and Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under the section entitled “Transfer Restrictions” of this Offering Circular. No Class E Notes, Class M-1 Subordinated Notes or Class M-2 Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class M-1 Subordinated Notes or the Class M-2 Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA, the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class M-1 Subordinated Note or Class M-2 Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.
It is possible that an investment in any of the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.
Each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to, one or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes, may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).
It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, for example, where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.

(c) if you are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan (1) you are not, and for so long as you hold such Note or interest therein will not be, subject to any federal, state, local non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or any interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to Other Plan Law (“Similar Law”) and (2) your acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note will not constitute or result in a non exempt violation of any Other Plan Law.
If you are a purchaser or transferee of a Class E Note, or Subordinated Note in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate, you will also agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding your interest in such Note
If you are a purchaser or transferee of a Class E Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Definitive Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate, you will be required to represent and warrant in writing to the Issuer that:

If you are a purchaser or transferee of a Class E Note, or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Definitive Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate, you will also agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding your interest in such Note.
No transfer of an interest in the Class E Notes, Class M-1 Subordinated Notes or Class M-2 Subordinated Notes will be permitted or recognized if it would cause the 25 per cent.

If the purchaser or transferee of any Note or beneficial interest therein is a Benefit Plan Investor, it will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or their respective affiliates, has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise acting as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.
Any Plan fiduciary considering whether to acquire a Note on behalf of a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code should consult with its counsel regarding the potential consequences of such investment, the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code or provisions of Similar Law or Other Plan Law, and the scope of any available exemption relating to such investment.
The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by such plans in general or any particular plan, or that this investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan.

The Subscription Agreement entitles the Initial Purchaser to terminate it in certain circumstances prior to payment being made to the Issuer. Each of the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be privately negotiated at the time of sale, which may vary among different purchasers and may be different from the issue price of the Notes.

In addition, the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may have in the past performed and may in the future perform investment banking services or other services for issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations. In addition, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may from time to time as a principal or through one or more investment funds that it or they manage, make investments in the equity securities of one or more of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations, with a result that one or more of such issuers may be or may become controlled by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates.

The Initial Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Initial Purchaser will purchase the Offered Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. NATIXIS may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Natixis Parties expect to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Initial Purchaser may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market.

In the event the purchaser fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to any tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer or its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the purchaser as compensation for any amounts withheld from payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, the Issuer will have the right to compel the purchaser to sell its Notes and, if such purchaser does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or its agents, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to such person as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate securities identifier in the Issuer’s sole discretion. Each purchaser agrees that the Issuer, the Trustee or their agents or representatives may (1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, the IRS and any other relevant tax authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Issuer complies with FATCA and the CRS.
(o) Each purchaser of Class E Notes, or Subordinated Notes, if it is not a “United States person” (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), represents that:
(i) either:
(A) it is not a bank (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code);
(B) after giving effect to its purchase of Notes, it will not directly or indirectly own more than 33⅓ per cent., by value, of the aggregate of the Notes within such Class and any other Notes that are ranked pari passu with or are subordinated to such Notes, and will not otherwise be related to the Issuer (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations section 1.881-3);
(C) it has provided an IRS Form W-8ECI representing that all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and includible in its gross income; or
(D) it has provided an IRS Form W-8BEN-E representing that it is a person eligible for benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that eliminates U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. source interest not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States; and
(ii) it has not purchased the Collateral Debt Obligations in whole or in part to avoid any U.S. federal tax liability (including, without limitation, any U.S. withholding tax that would be imposed on payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations if the Collateral Debt Obligations were held directly by the purchaser).
(p) Each purchaser of Subordinated Notes, if it owns more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes by value or if such purchaser, its beneficial owner, or a direct or indirect owner of the foregoing is otherwise treated as a member of the Issuer’s “expanded affiliated group” (as defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations section 1.1471-5(i) (or any successor provision)), represents that it will (A) confirm that any member of such expanded affiliated group (assuming that the Issuer is a “registered deemed-compliant FFI” within
the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations section 1.1471-1(b)(111) (or any successor provision)) that is treated as a “foreign financial institution” within the meaning of Section 1471(d)(4) of the Code and any
U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder is either a “participating FFI”, a “deemed-compliant FFI” or an “exempt beneficial owner” within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations section 1.1471- 4(e) (or any successor provision), and (B) promptly notify the Issuer in the event that any member of such expanded affiliated group that is treated as a “foreign financial institution” within the meaning of Section 1471(d)(4) of the Code and any U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder is not either a “participating FFI”, a “deemed-compliant FFI” or an “exempt beneficial owner” within the meaning of
U.S. Treasury Regulations section 1.1471-4(e) (or any successor provision), in each case except to the extent that the Issuer or its agents have provided the purchaser with an express waiver of this requirement.
(q) No purchaser of Subordinated Notes will treat any income with respect to its Subordinated Notes as derived in connection with the Issuer’s active conduct of a banking, financing, insurance, or other similar business for purposes of Section 954(h)(2) of the Code.
(r) No purchase or transfer of a Class E Note or a Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate will be recorded or otherwise recognized unless the purchaser or transferee has provided the Issuer with a certificate substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) hereto.
(s) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Issuer has the right under the Trust Deed to compel any Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder to sell its interest in the Notes, or may sell such interest in its Notes on behalf of such Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder.
(t) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator and their agents and Affiliates, and others, will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements.

(a) The purchaser is located outside the United States and is not a U.S. Person.
(b) The purchaser understands that the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that the Issuer has not registered and will not register under the Investment Company Act. It agrees, for the benefit of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and any of their Affiliates, that, if it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer such Notes (or any beneficial interest or participation therein) purchased by it, any offer, sale or transfer of such Notes (or any beneficial interest or participation therein) will be made in compliance with the Securities Act and only (i) to a person (A) it reasonably believes is a QIB purchasing for its own account or for the account of a QIB/QP in a nominal amount of not less than €250,000 for it and each such account, in a transaction that meets the requirements of Rule 144A and takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Note and (B) that constitutes a QP; or (ii) to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 (as applicable) under Regulation S.

Consents and Authorisations
The Issuer has obtained or will obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorisations in Ireland (if any) in connection with the issue and performance of the Notes.

There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 4 November 2019 and there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 4 November 2019.
No Litigation
The Issuer is not involved, and has not been involved, in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer is aware) which may have or have had since the date of its incorporation a significant effect on the Issuer’s financial position or profitability.
Accounts
Since the date of its incorporation, other than entering into certain documentation which has now been terminated, the Issuer has not commenced operations other than in respect of entering into the Warehouse Arrangements in respect of the acquisition of certain assets to be comprised in the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and has not produced accounts.
So long as any Note remains outstanding, copies of the most recent annual audited financial statements of the Issuer can be obtained at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent during normal business hours. The first financial statements of the Issuer will be in respect of the period from incorporation to 31 December 2020. The annual accounts of the Issuer will be audited. The Issuer will not prepare interim financial statements.
The Trust Deed requires the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee on an annual basis and otherwise promptly on request that no Note Event of Default or Potential Note Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) or other matter which is required to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
Documents Available
Copies of the following documents may be inspected in electronic format (and, in the case of each of (b) and (c) below, will be available for collection free of charge) at the registered offices of the Issuer during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and are admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market:
(a) the constitution of the Issuer;
(b) each Monthly Report;
(c) each Payment Date Report;
(d) the Corporate Services Agreement;

(f) the Agency Agreement;
(g) the Collateral Management Agreement;

Enforceability of Judgments

The Issuer is a designated activity company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Ireland. None of the directors and officers of the Issuer are residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United States courts judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States.
As the United States is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the United States courts is enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the United States courts will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are satisfied:
(a) the United States courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and
(b) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where, however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.
However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the United States courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:
(a) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;
(b) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;
(c) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice;

(2) Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in such entity.
Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and (iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the total value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.
If you check box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code: per cent.
AN ENTITY OR FUND THAT CANNOT PROVIDE THE FOREGOING PERCENTAGE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS OWN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT. OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE [CLASS E NOTES] [CLASS M-1 SUBORDINATED NOTES] [CLASS M-2 SUBORDINATED NOTES], 100 PER CENT. OF THE ASSETS OF THE ENTITY OR FUND WILL BE TREATED AS “PLAN ASSETS.”
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section 2, you should consult with your counsel.
(3) Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company’s corporate investment portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”).
If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent. test under the Plan Asset Regulations: per cent. IF YOU DO NOT
INCLUDE ANY PERCENTAGE IN THE BLANK SPACE, YOU WILL BE COUNTED AS IF YOU FILLED IN 100 PER CENT. IN THE BLANK SPACE.
(4) None of Sections 1 Through 3 above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections 1 through 3 above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections 1 through 3 above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer of such change.
(5) No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections 1 through 3 above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] do not and will not constitute or result in a non- exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
(6) Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to laws or regulations that are similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any law or regulation that is similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
(7) Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Collateral Manager, (ii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (iv) any “affiliate” of any of the above persons. “Affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a “Controlling Person.”
Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by class), the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.
(8) Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:
(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer may, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder within 10 days after the date of such notice;
(ii) if we fail to transfer our [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes], the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] or our interest in the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;
(iii) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] and selling such securities to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;
(iv) by our acceptance of an interest in the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes], we agree to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers;
(v) the proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to us; and
(vi) the terms and conditions of any sale under this sub-section shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to us as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
(9) Required Notification and Agreement. We hereby agree that we (a) will inform the Issuer of any proposed transfer by us of all or a specified portion of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] to a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and (b) will not initiate any such transfer after we have been informed by the Issuer or the Transfer Agent in writing that such transfer would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded. We hereby agree and acknowledge that after the Issuer effects any permitted transfer of [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] owned by us to a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person or receives notice of any such permitted change of status, the Issuer shall include such [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] in future calculations of the 25 per cent. Limitation made pursuant hereto unless subsequently notified that such [Class E Notes] [Class M- 1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] (or such portion), as applicable, would no longer be deemed to be held by Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons.
(10) Continuing Representation; Reliance. We acknowledge and agree that the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Certificate shall be deemed made on each day from the date we make such representations, warranties and agreements through and including the date on which we dispose of our interests in the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes]. We understand and agree that the information supplied in this Certificate will be used and relied upon by the Issuer to determine that Benefit Plan Investors own or hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by class) upon any subsequent transfer of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] in accordance with the Trust Deed.
(11) Further Acknowledgement and Agreement. We acknowledge and agree that (i) all of the assurances contained in this Certificate are for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager as third party beneficiaries hereof, (ii) copies of this Certificate and any information contained herein may be provided to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Manager, affiliates of any of the foregoing parties and to each of the foregoing parties’ respective counsel for purposes of making the determinations described above and (iii) any acquisition or transfer of the [Class E Notes] [Class M-1 Subordinated Notes] [Class M-2 Subordinated Notes] by us that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate shall be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.
(12) Future Transfer Requirements.

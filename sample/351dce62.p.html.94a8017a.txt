Application has been made to The Irish Stock Exchange plc trading as Euronext Dublin (the “Euronext Dublin”) for the Notes to be admitted to the official list (the “Official List”) and trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin (the “Global Exchange Market”) which is the exchange regulated market of Euronext Dublin.

In the event that there is a shortfall in such proceeds, the Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets (including the Irish Excluded Assets (as defined herein)) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall, all claims in respect of which shall be extinguished.

(i) which are in the possession of the Collateral Manager;
(ii) which are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure (unless the relevant information can be summarised or disclosed in an anonymised form, in accordance with such legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure); and
(iii) to which the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) does not otherwise have access or which are not otherwise in the Collateral Administrator’s possession, required for compliance by the Issuer with the EU Transparency Requirements;
(c) the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of (and at the expense of) the Issuer and in consultation with the Collateral Manager, shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, compile each of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, in each case in the form required by and in accordance with the frequency requirements set out in the EU Transparency Requirements and

(d) the Collateral Administrator shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, make such Loan Reports and Investor Reports (each as defined below), together with any other information, data and reports (as may be provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available to the Relevant Recipients via the Reporting Website or such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as notified to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Administrator shall not assume any statutory responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information, documents and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information, documentation or reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents. Any such reports may refer to disclaimers excluding liability of the Collateral Administrator for the information provided therein.
The Issuer intends that this Offering Circular constitutes a transaction summary or overview of the main features of the transaction contemplated herein for the purposes of Article 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation.
Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction and the transaction’s structure are sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any similar retention requirements. Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Circular none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Persons, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Corporate Services Provider, the Collateral Administrator or any other Agent, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information or structure is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such Person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or structure or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy or otherwise comply with the requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory, or other requirements. Furthermore, the Retention Holder does not have any obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention due to any future changes in the EU Retention Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements” and “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below.
U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES
Except with respect to asset-backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exceptions or that fall within the scope of the LSTA Decision, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as defined below) require the “sponsor” of a “securitization transaction,” if any, to retain (either directly or through its “majority-owned affiliates”) not less than 5% of the “credit risk” of “securitized assets” (as such terms are defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules prohibit the “sponsor” or its “majority-owned affiliates,” as applicable, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the “credit risk” during the period of time that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules required that the risk be retained.
Based on the LSTA Decision, it should be assumed by each prospective investor that no party involved in the transaction will obtain on the Issue Date and retain any Notes intended to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. None of the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Corporate Services Provider, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder or any Agent or any of their respective affiliates or any other Person makes any representations, warranty or guarantee, and no such Person shall have any liability to any recipient of this Offering Circular or any other Person with respect to the sufficiency of information provided herein or actions described herein with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other
requirements or whether such regulations are applicable to this transaction. Each prospective investor in the Notes, to the extent it considers the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to be relevant to its decision to invest, should independently assess and determine the sufficiency, for the purposes of complying with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, of the information set forth in this Offering Circular, and should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisers or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and with respect to any other related requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – U.S. Dodd-Frank Act”.

VOLCKER RULE
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.
An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund,” as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.
In June 2020, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule adopted amendments to the Volcker Rule’s final regulations, including changes relevant to the treatment of securitisations (the “Volcker Changes”). Among other things, the Volcker Changes ease certain aspects of the “loan securitization” exclusion, and create additional exclusions from the “covered fund” definition, and narrow the definition of “ownership interest” to exclude certain “senior debt interests”. In addition, under the Volcker Changes, a debt interest is no longer considered an “ownership interest” solely because the holder has the right to remove or replace the manager following a cause-related default. The Volcker Changes became effective on 1 October 2020; however it should be noted that in certain circumstances, an adopted regulation, including but not limited to the Volcker Changes, can be rescinded under the Congressional Review Act if a joint resolution of disapproval is adopted by both houses of Congress within a limited number of days following adoption of the regulation.
The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders may seek removal of the Collateral Manager and select a replacement Collateral Manager for Cause (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement). Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.
Prospective investors should make their own determinations as to whether their investment qualifies as an “ownership interest”.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule (including whether it is a “covered fund” for their purposes) or (ii) the ability of any investor to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes.
Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Volcker Rule” below.
INFORMATION AS TO PLACEMENT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
The Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” as defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than the Subordinated Notes) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”) or in the case of the Subordinated Notes or in some other cases definitive certificates (each a “Rule 144A Definitive Certificate” and together the “Rule 144A Definitive Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”) or in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Notes of each Class (other than the Subordinated Notes) sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes”) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”), or the case of the Subordinated Notes or in some other cases by definitive certificates of such Class (each a “Regulation S Definitive Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Definitive Certificates”) in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (“U.S. Residents”) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate. Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Notes in definitive certificated form will be issued in respect of the Subordinated Notes or otherwise only in limited circumstances. In each case, purchasers and transferees of notes will be deemed, and in certain circumstances will be required, to have made certain representations and agreements. See “Form of the Notes,” “Book Entry Clearance Procedures,” “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions” below.
The Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act in reliance on Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Each purchaser of an interest in the Notes (other than a non-U.S. Person outside the U.S.) will be deemed to have represented and agreed that it is a QP and will also be deemed to have made the representations set out in “Transfer Restrictions” herein. The purchaser of any Note, by such purchase, agrees that such Note is being acquired for its own account and not with a view to distribution (other than in the case of the Placement Agent and the Sole Arranger) and may be resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (1) to the Issuer (upon redemption thereof or otherwise), (2) to a person the purchaser reasonably believes is a QIB which is also a QP, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or (3) outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S, in each case, in compliance with the Trust Deed and all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

General Notice
EACH PURCHASER OF THE NOTES MUST COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN EACH JURISDICTION IN WHICH IT PURCHASES, OFFERS OR SELLS SUCH NOTES OR POSSESSES OR DISTRIBUTES THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR AND MUST OBTAIN ANY CONSENT, APPROVAL OR PERMISSION REQUIRED FOR THE PURCHASE, OFFER OR SALE BY IT OF SUCH NOTES UNDER THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN ANY JURISDICTIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT OR IN WHICH IT MAKES SUCH PURCHASES, OFFERS OR SALES, AND NONE OF THE ISSUER, THE PLACEMENT AGENT, THE SOLE ARRANGER, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, THE TRUSTEE (OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES) OR ANY AGENT SPECIFIED HEREIN SHALL HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY THEREFOR.
THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME.
THE ISSUER IS A DESIGNATED ACTIVITY COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES DULY INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF IRELAND AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS PROHIBITED FROM MAKING ANY INVITATION TO THE PUBLIC TO SUBSCRIBE FOR, OR MAKING ANY OFFER TO THE PUBLIC OF, THE NOTES. NEITHER THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR NOR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT CONSTITUTES AN OFFER TO PURCHASE, OR AN INVITATION TO THE PUBLIC BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER TO SUBSCRIBE FOR, THE NOTES.
Commodity Pool Regulation
BASED UPON INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF SWAP DEALER AND INTERMEDIARY OVERSIGHT OF THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”), THE ISSUER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TREATED AS A “COMMODITY POOL” UNDER THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”). HOWEVER, IF ENTERING INTO HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL” UNDER THE CEA, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EXPECT TO CLAIM AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION WITH THE CFTC AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) PURSUANT TO CFTC RULE 4.13(a)(3). THEREFORE, UNLIKE A REGISTERED CPO, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER A CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT TO PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS, NOR WOULD IT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CERTIFIED ANNUAL REPORTS THAT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF CFTC RULES APPLICABLE TO REGISTERED CPOs. IN ORDER TO FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF CFTC REGISTRATION, THE ISSUER (OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER ON THE ISSUER’S BEHALF) MAY ONLY ENTER INTO HEDGE AGREEMENTS (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF “SWAP” IN THE CEA) FOLLOWING
RECEIPT OF LEGAL ADVICE FROM REPUTABLE COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ENTRY INTO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS SHALL NOT REQUIRE ANY OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS EITHER A CPO OR A “COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR” AS DEFINED IN THE CEA IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER.
U.S. Tax
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR TO THE CONTRARY, EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR (AND EACH EMPLOYEE, REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER AGENT OF EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR) MAY DISCLOSE TO ANY AND ALL PERSONS, WITHOUT LIMITATION OF ANY KIND, THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAX TREATMENT OF THE ISSUER, THE NOTES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR AND ALL MATERIALS OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING OPINIONS OR OTHER U.S. TAX ANALYSES) RELATING TO SUCH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAX TREATMENT AND THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING SUCH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAX TREATMENT.
MiFID II Product Governance
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.
PRIIPs Regulation
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.
Prospectus Regulation
This Offering Circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA or in the UK (each, a “Relevant State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant State of Notes that are the subject of an offering contemplated in this Offering Circular may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Placement Agent to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to such offer. None of the Issuer nor the Placement Agent or any of its Affiliates has authorised, nor does either of them authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Placement Agent or any of its Affiliates to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.
APPLICABILITY OF EU LAW IN THE UK
THE UK WITHDREW FROM AND CEASED TO BE A MEMBER STATE OF THE EU AT 11:00 P.M. GMT ON 31 JANUARY 2020. THE NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE UK AND THE EU PROVIDES FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD, COMMENCING ON 31 JANUARY 2020 AND ENDING AT 11.00 P.M. GMT ON 31 DECEMBER 2020, UNLESS EXTENDED BY A SINGLE DECISION FOR UP TO ONE OR TWO YEARS (SUCH PERIOD, THE “TRANSITION PERIOD”) OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT, EU LAW WILL BE
APPLICABLE TO AND IN THE UK DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD ANY REFERENCES IN THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR TO THE “EU” AND ITS “MEMBER STATES” IN THE CONTEXT OF EU LEGISLATION AND THE APPLICATION THEREOF SHALL BE INTERPRETED SO AS TO INCLUDE THE UK (EXCEPT WHERE EXPRESSLY INDICATED OTHERWISE).

Notes










2034





1 The Notes are being issued at a maximum issue price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. Each of the Issuer and the Placement Agent may offer the
Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and be different to the issue price of the Notes.
2 Any Class of Rated Notes may be issued with a fixed rate or a floating rate or a combination of both.
3 Applicable to each three month Accrual Period, provided that the rate of interest of the Notes of each Class (other than the Class B-2 Notes) for the initial Accrual Period will be determined by reference to a straight line interpolation of 6 month EURIBOR and 12 month EURIBOR.
4 Applicable to each 6 month Accrual Period, provided that the rate of interest of the Notes of each Class (other than the Class B-2 Notes) for the period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date will, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls on or about 15 October 2033, be determined by reference to 3 month EURIBOR.
5 Payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes will be made on an available funds basis in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Applicable Margin or spread over EURIBOR, in the case of the Rated Notes (other than the Class B-2 Notes), may be reduced pursuant to a refinancing in accordance with Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders).
6 A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency. Each of S&P and KBRA is established in the EU and Moody’s is established in the UK. As of the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is registered under CRA3 and included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA3. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and Class B Notes by each of S&P and KBRA address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes and Class E Notes by each of S&P and KBRA, and the Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes, Class B Notes and Class F Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.
7 EURIBOR will be subject to a minimum of zero per cent. per annum.

Eligibility CriteriaIn order to qualify as a Collateral Obligation, an obligation must
satisfy certain specified Eligibility Criteria. Each obligation shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such obligation save for an Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must also satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date. See “The Portfolio – Eligibility Criteria”.
Restructured Obligations ........................... In order for a Collateral Obligation which is the subject of a
restructuring to qualify as a Restructured Obligation, such Collateral Obligation must satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria as at the applicable Restructuring Date.
Collateral Quality TestsThe Collateral Quality Tests will comprise the following:
For so long as any of the Rated Notes rated by Moody’s are Outstanding:
(a) the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test (from the Effective Date and until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only);
(b) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test;
(c) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test; and

Form, Registration and
Transfer of the NotesThe Regulation S Notes of each Class will be represented on issue
by beneficial interests in one or more Regulation S Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”). Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may at any time be held only through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Form of the Notes” and “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Interests in any Regulation S Note may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than the Subordinated Notes) will be represented on issue by one or more Rule 144A Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may at any time only be held through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.
The Rule 144A Global Certificates will bear a legend and such Rule 144A Global Certificates, or any interest therein, may not be transferred except in compliance with the transfer restrictions set out in such legend. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
No beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery thereof through a Regulation S Global Certificate unless the transferor provides the Transfer Agent with a written certification substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed regarding compliance with certain of such transfer restrictions. Any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate to a person who takes delivery through an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate is also subject to certification requirements substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed and each purchaser thereof shall be deemed to represent that such purchaser is a QIB/QP. In addition, interests in any of the Regulation S Notes may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident. See “Form of the Notes” and “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”.
Except in the limited circumstances described herein, Notes in definitive, certificated, fully registered form (“Definitive Certificates”) will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests
in either the Regulation S Global Certificates or the Rule 144A Global Certificates provided that a Subordinated Noteholder must hold Subordinated Notes in Definitive Certificates. See “Form of the Notes – Exchange for Definitive Certificates”.
On the Issue Date, an acquirer of a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person unless such acquirer: (i) receives the written consent of the Issuer; and (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed. Other than on the Issue Date, an acquirer of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person unless such acquirer: (i) receives the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed); and (iii) other than with respect to Retention Notes, holds such Class E Note or Class F Note, as applicable, in the form of a Definitive Certificate. The Subordinated Notes will only be issued in the form of Definitive Certificates. Each purchaser and transferee understands and agrees that no transfer of an interest in Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be permitted or recognised if it would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class).
If a holder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Regulation S Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, (but in no case for less than the minimum authorised denomination applicable to such Notes); and (ii) a certificate in the form of part 7 (Form of Definitive Certificate to Regulation S Global Certificate Transfer Certificate of Class E Notes or Class F Notes) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (a copy of which is provided to the Registrar) given by the holder of the beneficial interests in such Notes.
Each person who becomes an owner of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to have represented and agreed to the representations set forth in this Offering Circular relating to such Notes under the heading “Transfer Restrictions”.
If a holder of Class E Notes Class F Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Rule 144A Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (but in no case for less than the minimum authorised denomination applicable to Notes of such Class); and (ii) a certificate in the form of part 6 (Form of Definitive Certificate to Rule 144A Global Certificate Transfer Certificate of Class E Notes or Class F Notes) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (in each case, copies of which are provided to the Registrar as applicable) given by the proposed transferee.
Each person who becomes an owner of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will be deemed to have represented and agreed to the representations set forth in this Offering Circular relating to such Notes under the heading “Transfer Restrictions”.
Transfers of interests in the Notes are subject to certain restrictions and must be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Trust Deed. See “Form of the Notes,” “Book Entry Clearance Procedures” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Each purchaser of Notes in making its purchase will be required to make, or will be deemed to have made, certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

(b) the Collateral Manager will undertake in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, at the expense of the Issuer and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, to assist the Issuer in complying with its obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements, including by providing to the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, any reports, data and other information:
(i) which are in the possession of the Collateral Manager;
(ii) which are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure (unless the relevant information can be summarised or disclosed in an anonymised form, in accordance with such legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure); and
(iii) to which the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) does not otherwise have access or which are not otherwise in the Collateral Administrator’s possession, required for compliance by the Issuer with the EU Transparency Requirements;
(c) the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of (and at the expense of) the Issuer and in consultation with the Collateral Manager, shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, compile each of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, in each case in the form required by and in accordance with the frequency requirements set out in the EU Transparency Requirements and subject to the receipt by the Collateral Administrator of any reports, data and other information that is not otherwise in its possession or reasonably available to it as is necessary in connection with the preparation thereof; and
(d) the Collateral Administrator shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, make such Loan Reports and Investor Reports (each as defined below), together with any other information, data and reports (as may be provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available to the Relevant Recipients via the Reporting Website or such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as notified to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Administrator shall not assume any statutory responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information, documents and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information, documentation or reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents. Any such reports may refer to disclaimers excluding liability of the Collateral Administrator for the information provided therein.
RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral Obligations securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. The following risk factors are applicable to an investment in the Notes. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.

1. GENERAL COMMERCIAL RISKS

1.1 General

It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets) with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment) and Condition 11(b) (Enforcement). In particular,
(i) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the other Classes of Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes.
None of the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Agents or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Agents or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular, the Monthly Reports or the Payment Date Reports, as the case may be.
In preparing and furnishing the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager and third parties) (and reviewed by the Collateral Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.
In addition, the information contained in the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will be dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager. The accuracy of the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, and the information included therein, will therefore be subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager.
1.2 Suitability
Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access
to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer
The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified and or pre funded and/or secured.
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s

Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if there are market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets
European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.
As discussed further in 1.7 “European Union and Euro Zone Risk,” it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.
In addition, Obligors of Collateral Obligations may be organised in, or otherwise Domiciled in, certain of such countries currently suffering from economic distress, or other countries that may begin to suffer economic distress, and the uncertainty and market instability in any such country may increase the likelihood of default by such Obligor. If any such Obligor becomes insolvent, by virtue of being organised in such a jurisdiction or having a substantial percentage of its revenues or assets in such a jurisdiction, it may be more likely to be subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in such jurisdiction at the same time as such jurisdiction is itself potentially unstable.
Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis and the ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loans arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs may be partially or significantly limited.
As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. A continuing decreased ability of obligors to obtain refinancing may result in an economic decline causing a deterioration in loan performance generally and defaults of Collateral Obligations. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.
Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.
The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non- performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.
The global credit crisis and its consequences, together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.
While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors or whether such conditions or markets will deteriorate rather than improve.
COVID-19

There has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (COVID-19)) (“COVID-19”), that was first detected in December 2019 and which has now been found in over 200 countries globally. This outbreak and measures being put in place to restrict its spread have disrupted (and may continue to disrupt) economies and slowed (and may continue to slow) economic growth both in countries where the outbreak has been detected and in others. This may result, and in some cases (including in respect of the United Kingdom and Member States of the European Union) has resulted, in the downgrade of certain sovereign credit ratings by certain rating agencies. This has (and continues to) materially and adversely impact the global supply chain, market and economies. At this time, the outbreak has not been successfully contained and continues to detrimentally affect societies and economies globally and it remains uncertain as to what its ultimately
impact will be in different affected areas, or how disruptive such outbreak and preventive measures (including for example certain financial relief measures for both individuals and corporate entities adopted by governmental bodies and financial institutions) may be to the global and regional economies. This state of affairs is causing (and may continue to cause) significant uncertainty in both domestic and global financial markets, has led to (and may continue to cause) volatility and disruption in the capital markets and has had (and may continue to have) a material adverse effect on Obligors of Collateral Obligations. In particular, these additional risks and market disruptions have materially and adversely affected (and may continue to materially and adversely affect) the ability of certain Obligors to make payments under Collateral Obligations, the liquidity and value of the Notes, the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations (see 4.25 “Ratings on Collateral Obligations”), the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes and the Issuer’s ability to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations.
In particular, rating actions (including, in respect of the potential downgrade of ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations, such ratings being downgraded between the date of this Offering Circular and the Issue Date) may result in the Initial Ratings of any Class of Rated Notes published by the Rating Agencies being lower than is described in this Offering Circular. Furthermore, any such rating actions taken between the Issue Date and the Effective Date could result in (a) a downgrade of one of more Classes of Rated Notes from their Initial Ratings and (b) certain Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests not being satisfied as at the Effective Date, resulting in an Effective Date Rating Event and following which the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) (see also 4.5 “Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period”). If any rating assigned to the Notes is subject to a downgrade, the market value of the Notes may reduce and holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount (see 3.16 “Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope”).
1.6 Illiquidity in the Collateralised Debt Obligation, Leveraged Finance and Fixed Income Markets may Affect the Noteholders
In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk
Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.
As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.
Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.
Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the imposition of capital controls, the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.
1.8 The UK’s Withdrawal from the European Union
On 31 January 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU (as more particularly described below). At this time, the full consequences of such withdrawal are not clear.
In particular, there is uncertainty as to the final trade arrangements to be put in place following the expiry of the Transition Period (as defined below). Investors should be aware that the Issuer's risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.
Applicability of EU law in the UK

The negotiated withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK provides for a transition period, commencing on 31 January 2020 and ending at 11.00 p.m. GMT on 31 December 2020, unless extended by a single decision for up to one or two years (such period, the “Transition Period”). The UK government has stated that it will not seek such an extension. The negotiated withdrawal agreement states that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law will be applicable to and in the UK during the Transition Period. Accordingly, during the Transition Period any references in this Offering Circular to the “EU” and its “Member States” in the context of EU legislation and the application thereof shall be interpreted so as to include the UK (except where expressly indicated otherwise).
During the Transition Period negotiations will continue between the UK and the EU in respect of the nature of their future relationship. It is at present unclear what type of future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will be established. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so or when negotiations of such relationship will be finalised.
Following the end of the Transition Period, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the final trade arrangements to be put in place, substantial amendments to English law may occur and may diverge from the corresponding provisions of EU law applicable after the Transition Period. Consequently, English law may change and differ from EU law and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio, the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects or any potential investors. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Regulatory Risk

Under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EEA and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross- border basis in other EEA countries without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to how, following the expiry of the Transition Period, the existing passporting regime will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the EEA and the UK, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may, following the expiry of the Transition Period, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.
There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU will include arrangements for the continuation of the existing passporting regime or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Market Risk

Following the result of the referendum on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and its subsequent withdrawal, the financial markets have experienced volatility and disruption. This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.
Investors should be aware that as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, any negotiation between the UK and the EU with respect to their future trading relationship and following the expiry of the Transition Period, changes to legislation may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Exposure to Counterparties

The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the end of the Transition Period and depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see 4.17 “Counterparty Risk”.
Ratings Actions

Since the result of the referendum on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU each of S&P, Fitch Ratings Limited, and any successor or successors thereto (“Fitch”) and Moody’s downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and Moody’s also placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, each of Fitch and Moody’s have further downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and Fitch has also placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.
The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, such downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.
While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see 4.17 “Counterparty Risk”.
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available
Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that the Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Corporate Services Provider and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to those amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests. In addition, service providers who are not paid in full, including the Directors may have the right to resign. This could ultimately lead to the Issuer being in default under the applicable laws of Ireland and potentially being removed from the register of companies and dissolved.
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES
In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be, increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.
This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis creating the potential for conflict across jurisdictions. Investors should be aware that risks posed by such regulatory overlap and divergence are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes, could be materially and adversely affected thereby.
None of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All investors whose investment activities are subject to: investment laws, rules and regulations (including risk retention laws, rules and regulations that apply currently to the investor, or which may do so in the future); regulatory capital requirements; or to review by regulatory authorities (including risk retention rules whether currently applicable to the investor or in respect of the introduction or proposal of future risk retention rules) should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes are subject to any such investment or other restrictions and to unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any
representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor’s investment in the Notes).
2.1 Basel III and Basel IV
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the European Union.
In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will be phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027. No timeline has been established for adopting these changes by the U.S. banking regulatory agencies.
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. None of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Trustee or any of their affiliates makes any representation or warranty to any such prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
2.2 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements Securitisation Regulation
Background

A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the CRR (as defined below) (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The
Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).
There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below. Most of the relevant technical standards have not yet been adopted.
Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal regulatory or other requirements. No such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.
Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors

The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the “Capital Requirements Regulations” or the “CRR”), insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).
These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified (among other things) that: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investor; (ii) the originator, sponsor or securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which see “Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation; and (iv) where the originator or original lender is established in a non- EU country, credit granting criteria apply that are substantially similar to those in (iii).
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.
Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those Institutional Investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge in respect of the Notes acquired by the relevant investor.
Risk Retention Obligation

The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or of up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover (the “Pecuniary Sanctions”).
Any such Pecuniary Sanction levied on the Retention Holder may materially adversely affect the ability of the Retention Holder to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements”.

Transparency Requirements

The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e., the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting requirements in Article 7 (the “Transparency Requirements”). The reporting entity must make certain prescribed information available to holders of a securitisation position, to the relevant competent authorities (“Competent Authorities”) and, upon request, to potential investors.
Under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing. It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form by way of a website (see “Description of the Reports”). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date.
Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) (“Inside Information”); and, where applicable, information on “significant events” (“Significant Events”).
The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not more than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.
On 16 October 2019 the Commission adopted certain technical standards under the Transparency Requirements containing detailed draft disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports, Investor Reports and, in relation to public transactions only, Inside Information and Significant Events (the “Transparency RTS”). The Transparency RTS were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 3 September 2020 and apply from 23 September 2020. There remains significant uncertainty as to the jurisdictional scope of the reporting requirements contained in the Transparency RTS.
Transparency Requirements – Collateral Manager and Issuer arrangements

In relation to the reporting obligations in the Transparency Requirements: (a) the Issuer will undertake to be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations and to adhere to its obligations in respect thereof; (b) the Collateral Manager will undertake in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, to assist the Issuer in complying with its obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements, including by providing to the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) subject to any confidentiality undertaking
given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, any reports, data and other information: (i) which are in the possession of the Collateral Manager; (ii) which are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure (unless the relevant information can be summarised or disclosed in an anonymised form, in accordance with such legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure); and (iii) to which the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) does not otherwise have access or which are not otherwise in the Collateral Administrator’s possession, required for compliance by the Issuer with the EU Transparency Requirements; (c) the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of (and at the expense of) the Issuer and in consultation with the Collateral Manager, shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, compile each of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, in each case in the form required by and in accordance with the frequency requirements set out in the EU Transparency Requirements and subject to the receipt by the Collateral Administrator of any reports, data and other information that is not otherwise in its possession or reasonably available to it as is necessary in connection with the preparation thereof; and (d) the Collateral Administrator shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, make such Loan Reports and Investor Reports (each as defined below), together with any other information, data and reports (as may be provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available to the Relevant Recipients via the Reporting Website or such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as notified to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf).
The Issuer intends to ensure that the Loan Reports and Investor Reports will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Transparency RTS. Whether the Collateral Manager will be able to obtain and provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the Transparency Requirements is unclear.
Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the originator as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the reporting entity), or by the Collateral Manager, to fulfil the Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.
If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes; and (ii) the Retention Holder as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Retention Holder as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
Investors should be aware that, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will not be liable for, and will only indemnify the Issuer for, any failure by the Issuer to comply with the Transparency Requirements to the extent such failure constitutes gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) on the part of the Collateral Manager. As described in the section of this Offering Circular titled “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement – Responsibilities of the Collateral Manager,” this represents a significantly lower standard of care than negligence under English law and as a result, if a failure by the Issuer to meet the Transparency Requirements was caused by the negligence of the Collateral Manager, the Issuer would not be able to claim under such indemnity to the extent that such negligence does not constitute gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law). Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer, in particular where no indemnity is available from the Collateral Manager as described herein, may reduce the returns on the Notes to investors. The Collateral Manager may be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager even if Pecuniary Sanctions arise due to the negligence under English law of the Collateral Manager, provided there is no gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York) on the part of the Collateral Manager (see the section of this Offering Circular titled “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement – Responsibilities of the Collateral Manager”).
Jurisdictional Scope of the Securitisation Regulation Obligations

The Securitisation Regulation is silent as to the jurisdictional scope of the direct risk retention obligation and the Transparency Requirements and whether, for example, these obligations apply to U.S. established entities such as the Collateral Manager or the Retention Holder.
As regards the jurisdictional scope of the direct risk retention obligation, the Explanatory Memorandum to the original European Commission proposal for a Securitisation Regulation implied that the direct obligation would not apply where none of the originator, sponsor or original lender is established in the EU. The European Banking Authority (the “EBA”) confirmed this interpretation (in its “Feedback on the public consultation” section of its Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards published on 31 July 2018) where it said: “The EBA agrees however that a “direct” obligation should apply only to originators, sponsors and original lenders established in the EU as suggested by the Commission in the explanatory memorandum”. This EBA interpretation is, however, non-binding and not legally enforceable.
The Securitisation Regulation is silent as to the jurisdictional scope of the Transparency Requirements, and it is unclear if they apply where none of originator, sponsor and SSPE is established in the EU.
Uncertainties in the Scope of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements

Aspects of the detail and effect of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements and what is, or will be, required to demonstrate compliance to Competent Authorities remain unclear. The EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention. Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements by an institution, similar to the Retention Holder. Furthermore, any relevant regulator’s views with regard to the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.
Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
No assurance can be given that the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention due to any future changes in the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation and the Irish STS Regulations shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.
Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or any similar requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, any other Agent, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any information described herein is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements, any implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements in any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.
Irish STS Regulations

The European Union (General Framework for Securitisation and Specific Framework for Simple, Transparent and Standardised Securitisation) Regulations 2018 of Ireland (the “Irish STS Regulations”)
came into operation on 1 January 2019 and gives full effect to the Securitisation Regulation in Ireland. The Irish STS Regulations appointed the Central Bank of Ireland as the national competent authority in Ireland and it has the power to (i) give directions to the originator, sponsor, SSPE, or other original lender or any other person, (ii) issue a contravention notice to an originator, sponsor, SSPE or other original lender to ensure compliance with, or to prevent a breach of the Securitisation Regulation or the Irish STS Regulations, or to direct that reporting errors or omissions be corrected, (iii) appoint an assessor to investigate a breach by a non-regulated entity of the Securitisation Regulation or the Irish STS Regulations, and impose sanctions for such a breach (including pecuniary sanctions of up to EUR 5,000,000, or, of up to 10.0 per cent. of the total annual net turnover), and (iv) apply its administrative sanctions procedure to any negligent or intentional contravention of the Securitisation Regulation or the Irish STS Regulations by a regulated financial services provider.
Pursuant to the Irish STS Regulations, the Issuer must make a notification to the Central Bank of Ireland within 15 working days of the issue of the Notes and in the manner prescribed in Regulation 6 of the Irish STS Regulations (the “15 Day Notification”). Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the Issuer will (with reasonable assistance from the Collateral Manager, if required) covenant to make the 15 Day Notification within the period required under the Irish STS Regulations.
U.S. Risk Retention Rules

On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). On 9 February 2018, a three- judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favour of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and held that collateral managers of “open market CLOs” (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) are not “securitizers” or “sponsors” under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention and do not have to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (the “LSTA Decision”). The Panel’s opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on 5 April 2018, when the district court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on 3 April 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof.
As a result the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that it does not expect to be required to retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules; provided, however, that the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder will retain the Retention Notes on the Issue Date, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements. Accordingly investors will not be entitled to the protections previously afforded by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that required CLO collateral managers to have “skin in the game” and to comply with certain disclosure obligations specified in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.
No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for the type of transaction contemplated herein (a “New Risk Retention Rule” and together with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, “U.S. Retention Regulations”), and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.
If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.
In the event that the U.S. Retention Regulations become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuer’s ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to the consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to each such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required under the Trust Deed with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-
interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuers and/or any holders of Notes).
Recent developments concerning the treatment of CLOs for certain Japanese investors

On 15 March 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitisation Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitisation Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitisation exposures they purchase after 31 March 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitisation, including the establishment and utilization of a due diligence system for evaluating securitised products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitisation transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitisation Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organization of the securitised product,” retains at least 5% of the securitised exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitisation Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5% retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitised exposures”).
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining Notes of each Class with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed,” that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitisation Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
2.3 Retention Financing
The Retention Holder intends to enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the EU Retention Requirements (any such arrangements, the “Retention Financing Arrangements”) and in respect of any Retention Financing Arrangements, will either grant security over, or transfer title to, the Retention Notes in connection with such financing. If the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would retain the economic risk in the Retention Notes but not legal
ownership of them and furthermore, the counterparty having acquired the Retention Notes may have the ability to dispose of them. None of the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that such Retention Financing Arrangements will comply with the EU Retention Requirements. In particular, should the Retention Holder default in the performance of its obligations under the Retention Financing Arrangements, the lender or lenders thereunder would have the right to enforce the security granted by the Retention Holder, including effecting the sale or appropriation of some or all of the Retention Notes or, if the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would not be entitled to have the Retention Notes (or equivalent securities) returned to it. In exercising its rights pursuant to any Retention Financing Arrangements, any lender would not be required to have regard to the EU Retention Requirements or the Noteholders and any such sale or appropriation may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements. See 5 “Certain Conflicts of Interest – Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates”.
The term of any Retention Financing Arrangements may be considerably shorter than the effective term of the Notes, and separately, or as a result of other terms of the Retention Financing Arrangements may require the Retention Holder to repay or refinance the Retention Financing Arrangements whilst some or all Classes of Notes are Outstanding. If refinancing opportunities were limited at such time and the Retention Holder was unable to repay the retention financing from other its own resources, the Retention Holder could be forced to sell some or all of the Retention Notes in order to obtain funds to repay the retention financing without regard to the EU Retention Requirements, and such sales may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements.
2.4 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 as amended from time to time (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” (“FCs”) (such as certain investment firms, alternative investment funds (see 2.5 (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive)), credit institutions and insurance companies), “non- financial counterparties” (“NFCs”) or third country entities equivalent to FCs or NFCs.
Types of entities and obligations

EMIR sets out thresholds for entities to assist with the categorisation thereof: (i) in the case of NFCs, the aggregate month-end average position for the previous 12 months of all OTC derivative contracts entered into by the NFC and other non-financial entities within its “group” (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives), however, once the threshold for one asset class is exceeded, the NFC will be categorised as an NFC+ and (ii), in the case of FCs, the same thresholds apply, but FCs: (A) cannot exclude their hedging transactions from the threshold calculations, and (B) once the threshold for one asset class is exceeded, the FC must clear all OTC derivatives via an authorised or recognised central counterparty. FCs and NFCs, in each case, which are above the “clearing threshold” (“FC+s” and “NFC+s” respectively) are subject to an obligation to clear through an authorized or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties (NFC+s need only clear those asset classes in respect of which the clearing threshold is exceeded). All counterparties must report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”) (provided that from 18 June 2020, FCs have been responsible under EMIR for reporting in connection with OTC derivative contracts on behalf of both themselves and their NFC counterparties that are not subject to the clearing obligation, and accordingly, each Hedge Counterparty will be required to report details of any relevant Hedge Transactions for both itself and the Issuer) and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by FCs and NFC+s must also be marked-to-market on a daily basis and collateral may be required to be exchanged (the “margin requirement”) to the extent that the FC or NFC+ enters into OTC derivatives transactions with other counterparties subject to the margin requirement.
NFCs which are below such clearing threshold (each, an “NFC-”) and small financial counterparties (as described under EMIR) are not subject to the clearing obligation. An NFC- is also exempted from certain additional risk mitigation obligations, such as the posting of collateral.
Margin requirement

The margin requirement applies to non- cleared OTC derivatives. The margin requirement applies to FCs and NFC+s which transact with other FCs, NFC+s and third country equivalents (subject to exemptions) and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin. Variation margin requirements already apply and initial margin requirements are taking effect through a staged implementation period.
Under EMIR, NFCs may choose to calculate their aggregate month-end average positions for the previous 12 months. However, if an entity (such as the Issuer) is classified as NFC-, it is important that the calculation is made to avoid any concern or questions arising relating to the correct classification of the entity as an NFC-.
The Issuer expects to be an NFC-. However, if the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and/or if the aggregate month-end average position of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. Also, please see 2.5 “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below in respect of the potential classification of the Issuer as an AIF.
Prospective investors should be aware that if the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into or materially amend Hedge Transactions (and may also lead to termination of existing Hedge Transactions and/or Hedge Agreements) and/or may significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (to the extent that the Issuer is reclassified as a FC or NFC+ and becomes subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as the Asset Swap Transactions and the Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be, as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “Hedging Arrangements”.
The Conditions permit the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to the making of such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in the future.
2.5 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
AIFMD introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of AIFs. If the Issuer were to be considered to be an alternative investment fund (“AIF”) within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). If considered to be an AIF managed by an AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with the EMIR clearing obligation and/or risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivative contracts (including obligations to exchange margin) with respect to Hedge Transactions
(under the EMIR REFIT, all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also
2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”.
There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “SSPEs” (the “SSPE Exemption”). The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, “registered financial vehicle corporations” within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as, or appoint, an AIFM unless the Central Bank of Ireland issues further guidance advising them to do so.
If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.
The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.
If the Issuer were to be considered an AIF and an AIFM were to be appointed to manage the Issuer’s assets, such AIFM would need to comply with a number of requirements under AIFMD, including the appointment of a custodian in respect of the Issuer’s assets and compliance with certain reporting and disclosure obligations. Compliance with AIFMD by any such AIFM appointed by the Issuer will involve significant additional costs which may affect the return Noteholders receive from their investment.
2.6 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional notes issued pursuant to Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent or the Sole Arranger makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and
make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
2.7 U.S. Swap Regulations

Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including: (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps and (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.
Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but compliance with such regulations will not be required for in-scope entities until October 2021 at the earliest. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.
2.8 Commodity Pool Regulation

The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and, the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC and become a member of the NFA unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable interpretive guidance from the staff of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight of the CFTC, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA. In order to comply with the conditions of such guidance, or otherwise fall outside the scope of CFTC registration, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may only enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) if the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable international legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not require any of the Issuer, its Directors or officers or the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates to register with the CFTC and become a member of the NFA as a CPO or a CTA pursuant to the CEA.
If entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool,” the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), (A) the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer’s liquidation value; (B) purchasers of the Notes must be limited to specified eligible investors, including “qualified eligible persons” as defined in CFTC Rule 4.7, which term includes “qualified purchasers”; and (C) the Issuer must be able to represent that it is not, and is not marketed as, a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures or commodity options markets or in swaps. In addition, in order to claim
exemption from registration under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Collateral Manager would be required to represent to the CFTC that neither it nor any of its principals are subject to specified statutory disqualifications under the CEA. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Alternatively, the Collateral Manager may seek to rely on another exemption from CFTC registration. The conditions of such exemption may constrain the extent to which the Issuer may be able to enter into swap transactions. In particular, the limits imposed by such exemptions may prevent the Issuer from entering into a Hedge Agreement that the Collateral Manager believes would be advisable or result in the Issuer incurring financial risks that would have been hedged pursuant to swap transactions absent such limits. In addition, the costs of obtaining and maintaining such exemption will be passed on to the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.
Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
Neither the CFTC nor the NFA pass judgement upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related agreement for the placement or purchase of Notes by any Person.
2.9 Volcker Rule

Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.
An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund,” as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.
It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.
In June 2020, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule adopted amendments to the Volcker Rule’s final regulations, including changes relevant to the treatment of securitisations (the “Volcker Changes”). Among other things, the Volcker Changes ease certain aspects of the “loan securitization” exclusion, and create additional exclusions from the “covered fund” definition, and narrow the definition of “ownership interest” to exclude certain “senior debt interests”. In addition, under the Volcker Changes, a debt interest is no longer considered an “ownership interest” solely because the holder has the right to remove or replace the manager following a cause-related default. The Volcker Changes became effective on 1 October 2020; however it should be noted that in certain circumstances, an adopted regulation, including but not limited to the Volcker Changes, can be rescinded under the Congressional Review Act if a joint resolution of disapproval is adopted by both houses of Congress within a limited number of days following adoption of the regulation.
The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders may seek removal of the Collateral Manager and select a replacement Collateral Manager for Cause (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement). Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non- Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.
Prospective investors should make their own determinations as to whether their investment qualifies as an “ownership interest”.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.
2.10 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. Investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Changes in capital requirements have been announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and it is uncertain when all such changes will be fully implemented. When fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.
2.11 Flip Clauses

The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payments which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbor provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.
On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), 553 B.R. 476 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were ipso facto clauses which, in the absence of safe harbour protection, are unenforceable under the Code. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s holding that priority of distribution was a part of the liquidation of a swap agreement and therefore protected by the Code’s safe harbour provisions was affirmed on appeal by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on 14 March 2018 (Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), No. 17 CIV. 1224 (LGS), 2018 WL 1322225 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2018))
and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 11 August 2020 (Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Branch Banking and Tr. Co. (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), No. 18-1079, 2020 WL 4590247 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2020)) These judgments highlight the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payments, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses
contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
2.12 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform
The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has been reformed, with developments including:
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers’ Association in February 2014;
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.
In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.
The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.
It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.
The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, “EURIBOR”), together with LIBOR, and other so-called “benchmarks” are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.
In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.
The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks,” and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks
Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively.
Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator. On 2 July 2019, the European Money Markets Institute, administrator for EURIBOR, was granted authorisation under the Benchmarks Regulation by the Financial Services and Markets Authority of Belgium. EURIBOR is now considered compliant with the Benchmarks Regulation.
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):
(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and
(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.
Investors should be aware that:
(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”;
(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:
(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and
(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;
(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fall-back mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is
permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented within the timescale provided in and where required by Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Notes.
Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes.
2.13 Financial Transaction Tax (“FTT”)
In February 2013 the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, other than Estonia, the “Participating Member States”). However, on 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.
Under the Commission Proposal, the proposed FTT would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State or the financial instrument in which the parties are dealing is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.
Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain.
Additional Member States may also decide to participate in the FTT. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to any FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.
2.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures

Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “AML Requirements”). Any of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Agents could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure.
In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in
connection therewith. A Noteholder may also be obliged to provide information they may have previously identified or regarded as confidential to satisfy the Issuer’s AML Requirements.
2.15 CRA

CRA Regulation in Europe

Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013. CRA3 has subsequently been supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 of 30 September 2014 (the “CRA3 RTS”).
Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.
2.16 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
On 5 October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.
The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.
The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.
On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,” developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included Ireland and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.
Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 January 2019 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019.
Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument Ireland provided a list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties Ireland has entered into by the inclusion of a PTT.
In particular it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to any double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.
It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.
Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see 2.17 “EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.
2.17 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2

As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, and to provide a framework for a harmonised implementation of the BEPS conclusions across the EU, the EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “ATAD 1”) on 12 July 2016. The EU Council adopted Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2” and together with ATAD 1, “ATAD”) on 29 May 2017, amending the ATAD 1, to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU member states and third countries. EU member states had until 31 December 2018 to implement ATAD 1 (subject, in certain cases, to derogations for EU member states which have equivalent measures in their domestic law) and have until 31 December 2019 to implement the ATAD 2 (except for measures relating to reverse hybrid mismatches, which must be implemented by 31 December 2021 and which will apply as of 1 January 2022). The Directives contain various measures that could, depending on their implementation in Ireland, potentially result in certain payments made by the Issuer ceasing to be fully deductible. This could increase the Issuer’s liability to tax. There are two measures of particular relevance.
First, ATAD provides for an “interest limitation rule” which restricts the deductible interest of an entity to the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. However, the interest limitation only applies to the net borrowing costs of an entity (being the amount by which its borrowing costs exceed its taxable interest revenues and other economically equivalent taxable revenues). The interest limitation rule is anticipated to be in effect in Ireland from 1 January 2022.
Secondly, the ATAD provides for hybrid mismatch rules. These rules are designed to neutralise arrangements where amounts are deductible from the income of one entity but are not taxable for another, or the same amounts are deductible for two entities. These rules could potentially apply to the Issuer where: (i) the interest that it pays under the Notes, and claims deductions, from its taxable income for, is not brought into account as taxable income by the relevant Noteholder, either because of the characterisation of the Notes, or the payments made under them, or because of the nature of the Noteholder itself; and (ii) the mismatch arises between associated enterprises, between the Issuer and an associated enterprise or under a ‘structured arrangement’. ‘Associated’ for these purposes includes direct and indirect participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 25 per cent. or more or an entitlement to receive 25 per cent. or more (50 per cent. in certain circumstances) of the profits of that entity, as well as entities that are part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes or enterprises that have a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. A structured arrangement is an arrangement involving a transaction, or series of transactions, under which a mismatch outcome arises where; (a) the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement; or (b) the arrangement was designed to give rise to a mismatch outcome. The anti-hybrid rules have been in effect in Ireland since 1 January 2020.
If the Irish tax authorities impose net income, profits or similar tax upon the Issuer or its representative of any amount in excess of €1,000 for the relevant year a Note Tax Event will occur. If Issuer was unable to cure such Note Tax Event the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which
determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
2.18 Taxation Implications of Contributions
A Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Contribution in accordance with Condition 2(l) (Contributions). Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Contribution. Noteholders are solely responsible for any and all taxes that may be applicable in such circumstances. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisor as to the tax treatment to them of making a Contribution in accordance with Condition 2(l) (Contributions).
2.19 Irish Value Added Tax Treatment of the Collateral Management Fees

The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish domestic law, the Collateral Management Fees should be exempt from VAT. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a “qualifying company” as defined in Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.
This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the “VAT Directive”), which provides that Member States shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” as defined by Member States.
Historically, a similar position has been taken by the Netherlands, though recent developments have changed this and, in February 2020 the Dutch tax authorities issued letters to participants in the Dutch CLO market explaining that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in the Netherlands with effect from 1 April 2019. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS. However, on 22 April 2020, the Dutch tax authorities subsequently provided written guidance confirming that, although collateral management and administration fees remain subject to VAT, this will not apply with retroactive effect.
Partly in response to the Fiscale Eenheid X case, the European Commission has asked the VAT Committee (an advisory body comprising representatives from tax authorities of all of the Member States and chaired by a representative from the European Commission) (the “VAT Committee”) to shed light on the types of entities that can also qualify as “special investment funds”. A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a “special investment fund” if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.
The views expressed by the VAT Committee are merely advisory and do not necessarily have the agreement of the European Commission. Furthermore, its views are not legally binding and the courts may disagree with them. There is nevertheless a risk that the European Commission will accept the views of the VAT Committee and will conclude that entities such as the Issuer cannot qualify as a “special investment funds” because they are either not subject to the right sort of regulatory supervision in Ireland and/or because they do not target the same circle of investors as UCITS.
Member States have a degree of discretion on how to define “special investment funds”, and therefore there are some discrepancies amongst Member States on the meaning of the term. The Fiscale Eenheid X case was about how broad that discretion is. The application of the VAT exemption for “special investment funds” could now be reviewed at a Member State level and/or by the European Commission to ensure that the definitions used are within the ambit of discretion permitted by the VAT Directive.
The Issuer is not aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management fees paid by entities such as the Issuer. However, it is possible that some Member States (including Ireland) could change their domestic VAT laws, or the European Commission
could require them to do so. If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Collateral Management Fees. The VAT rate in Ireland is currently 21.0 per cent. for a temporary period up to 28 February 2021. The VAT rate will increase to 23 per cent. from 1 March 2021. It is also possible that Ireland could be required to recover the benefit of the VAT exemption obtained before the date on which the law changes from the Issuer together with interest.
The imposition of VAT in Ireland on the Collateral Management Fees will constitute a Note Tax Event. If a Note Tax Event occurs, the Issuer shall, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to cure that Note Tax Event (which may include changing the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would not give rise to a Note Tax Event). If the Issuer is unable to cure the Note Tax Event, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Furthermore, it may not be possible to substitute the Issuer with another company that is incorporated in another jurisdiction within the European Economic Area that does not charge VAT on CLO collateral management fees.
2.20 The Common Reporting Standard
The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) (“FIs”) relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implements the CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year (or from 2018 in the case of Austria).
Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS while the Finance Act 2014 of Ireland and the Finance Act 2015 of Ireland contain measures necessary to implement the CRS internationally and across the European Union, respectively. The Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 of Ireland (the “Regulations”) giving effect to the CRS from 1 January 2016 came into operation on 31 December 2015.
Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 50 countries, including Ireland and all other EU Member States (known as the “Early Adopter Group”) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners have indicated that Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer
being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.
The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance,
(iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.
2.21 Regulated Banking Activity

While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non-bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.
Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.
2.22 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.
The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.
The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.
2.23 U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts

U.S. regulators have adopted final rules and interpretative guidance setting forth limitations on certain insolvency-related default rights of parties to certain “qualified financial contracts” (“QFCs”) entered into with counterparties that have been designated as systemically important, along with certain of such entities’ subsidiaries and affiliates (each, a “Covered Entity”). Such rules and guidance (the “QFC Stay Rules”) generally require: (i) the Covered Entity to ensure that any stays imposed as a result of the entry of such entity into certain liquidation proceedings are contractually acknowledged by the counterparty to the QFC (in particular, where the relevant QFC is governed by non-U.S. law and/or the counterparty is located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction); and (ii) the Covered Entity to not agree in its QFCs to certain types of cross-defaults that are related, directly or indirectly, to the entry into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding of certain affiliates of the Covered Entity. If a Covered Entity enters into a contract with the Issuer that is subject to the QFC Stay Rules, the Covered Entity will be responsible for ensuring that such QFC complies with the QFC Stay Rules. As a result of the application of such rules, the Issuer may be required to accept limitations in its insolvency-related default rights against the Covered Entity.
2.24 Centre of Main Interests

Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), has been in force in Ireland since 26 June 2017 and applies to “insolvency proceedings” opened after 26 June 2017. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests (“COMI”) shall be “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties” and in the case of a company, such as the Issuer, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the registered office has not been moved from another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of “insolvency proceedings”.
In the decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the Court of Justice of the European Union restated the presumption in Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings, that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect”. This is consistent with Recital 30 to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.
Recital 28 to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation further indicates that in assessing whether a company’s centre of main interests is ascertainable to third parties for these purposes, “special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests”. As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has not moved its registered office from another Member State to Ireland within the three month period prior to a request for the opening of “insolvency proceedings,” has an Irish corporate services provider, has Irish directors and is registered for tax in Ireland, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI is not located in Ireland, and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, main insolvency proceedings may not be opened in Ireland.
Accordingly, pursuant to Article 3 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and as the Issuer is an Irish incorporated company and has its registered office in Ireland there is a rebuttable presumption that the Issuer’s COMI is in Ireland and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings applicable to it would be governed by Irish law.
2.25 Central Securities Depositories Regulation
Regulation (EU) No. 909/2014 of 23 July 2014 (the “CSDR”) requires that, amongst other things, from 1 January 2025 any EU issuer that issues transferable securities which are admitted to trading on a trading venue, multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility must arrange for such securities to be represented in book-entry form. The Global Exchange Market is a multilateral trading facility for this purpose, and it is therefore expected that the Issuer will be required to comply with the CSDR in respect of the Notes. Accordingly, if any Notes are represented by Definitive Certificates and in this regard, investors should note in particular that all Subordinated Notes will be required to be represented by Definitive Certificates on the Issue Date and Class E Notes and Class F Notes may be represented by Definitive Certificates following the Issue Date, the Issuer will be required to take action prior to 1 January 2025 to exchange such Definitive Certificates for interests in a Global Certificate, and in connection with which any holders of Definitive Certificates would be required to accept interests in a Global Certificate in exchange for their Definitive Certificates (and in particular, Subordinated Noteholders who will be required to hold Definitive Certificates on and from the Issue Date and Class E Noteholders and Class F Noteholders who hold Definitive Certificates following the Issue Date, will be so required to exchange their Definitive Certificates for interests in Global Certificates). There is no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to successfully implement such an exchange in all cases in order to comply with the CSDR and, any failure to so comply could result in the Issuer (or other transaction parties) becoming subject to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on Noteholders.
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES

3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer
Neither the Placement Agent nor the Sole Arranger (or any of their affiliates) is not under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be
transferred only to certain transferees. See the sections of this Offering Circular titled “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.
In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
3.2 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty or the Trustee

None of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty, the Trustee or any Affiliate thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any Noteholder of ownership of the Notes, and no Noteholder may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each Noteholder will be required to represent (or, in the case of certain non-certificated Notes, deemed to represent) to the Issuer, the Placement Agent and the Sole Arranger, among other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is within its powers and authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly authorised by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.
3.3 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility
The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
3.4 The Notes are Subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds (or a combination thereof):
(a) on any Business Day after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution;
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution; or
(c) on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event at the direction of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, in the case of any redemption in part pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders), the consent of the Collateral Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions (including, in the case of any redemption in part pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders), the consent of the Collateral Manager) at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).

If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Subordinated Notes. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).
The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.
The Collateral Manager may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Payment Date falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
If there is an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes or, in certain circumstances, that losses would not be incurred on the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.
3.5 The Notes are Subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Collateral Manager
The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole and absolute discretion notifies the Trustee that using reasonable endeavours it has been unable, for a period of 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.
3.6 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes

Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Class F Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests) and Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event).

3.7 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early

The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following an Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager notifies the Issuer that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.
3.8 The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio – Management of the Portfolio – Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
3.9 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and an Event of Default

Additional Issuances

At any time, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Retention Holder, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).
Redirection of Funds to Reinvestment

The Collateral Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds (including by deferring or waiving payment of some or all of its Collateral Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses.
Collateral Manager Advances

The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(k) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Outstanding Collateral Manager Advances may accrue interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 2.0 per cent. per annum. The making of Collateral Manager Advances are subject to the following conditions:
(i) the aggregate amount outstanding of all Collateral Manager Advances shall not, at any time, exceed
€5,000,000 (or such greater number as the Subordinated Noteholders may approve, acting by Ordinary Resolution); (ii) each Collateral Manager Advance shall be a minimum of €1,000,000 and a maximum of €3,000,000 (or such greater number as the Controlling Class may approve, acting by Ordinary Resolution); and (iii) not more than 3 Collateral Manager Advances (or such greater number as the Controlling Class may approve, acting by Ordinary Resolution) may be made in aggregate.
Reinvestment Amounts
Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iii) (Reinvestment Amounts – Requests to Reinvest) by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will decide (in consultation with the relevant Subordinated Noteholder but at the discretion of the Collateral Manager) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.
Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent an Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see 3.17 “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations”).
3.10 Limited Recourse Obligations
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders and (f) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders and (g) lastly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders, the Trustee or any other Secured Party (or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, examinership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer. These limited recourse provisions shall survive the termination of the Notes.
3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders

Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain conditions) result in one or more
payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.
3.12 Subordination of the Notes
The Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.
The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer during the Reinvestment Period to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Collateral Enhancement Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account if the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.
Non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes when the same becomes due and payable (save, in each case, as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon in the circumstances described in the Conditions), will constitute an Event of Default (where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five consecutive Business Days or ten consecutive Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). In such circumstances, the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default).

Non-payment of interest amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds will not constitute an Event of Default.
If any acceleration of the Class A Notes occurs, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of could be adverse to the interests of Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies
pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of the most senior Class of Notes Outstanding. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).

3.13 Calculation of Rate of Interest

If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Calculation Agent will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Floating Rate of Interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Calculation Agent is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Floating Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Floating Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, none of the Calculation Agent, any Agent or the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Floating Rate of Interest on any other basis and shall suffer no liability to any Noteholder for any adverse effects or losses incurred as a result.
Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes (if there is a material disruption to, change in the methodology of calculating, or cessation of, EURIBOR, or the Collateral Manager reasonably expects any of the foregoing will occur) without the consent of the Noteholders, subject to the conditions specified in Condition 14(c)(xxix) (Modification and Waiver).
3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, (so long as the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class D Notes, (so long as the Class C Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class E Notes, (so long as the Class D Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class F Notes, (so long as the Class E Notes are Outstanding) or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be an Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each
Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
3.15 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited
The Monthly Reports, Payment Date Reports, Investor Reports and Loan Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Noteholders may access these reports by way of a unique password obtained from the Collateral Administrator (or as may otherwise be permitted by the Collateral Manager) or, in connection with Investor Reports and Loan Reports, as further described herein. In preparing and furnishing these reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, recompute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.
3.16 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope
A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Rated Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Rated Notes and the market value of such Rated Notes is likely to be adversely affected.
Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.
The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Rated Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, Noteholders may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral Obligations including by restricting the ability of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to reinvest Sale Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds in Substitute Collateral Obligations following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, in each case due to the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period following a downgrade or withdrawal of ratings in relation to certain of the Rated Notes. See the sections of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio” and “Ratings of the Notes”.
Each of S&P and KBRA is established in the EU and Moody’s is established in the UK. As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is registered under CRA3 and included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Rating Agencies may refuse to give Rating Agency Confirmations

Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by Noteholders.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in Withdrawal of Ratings if Certain Actions are not Taken by the Issuer

On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,
(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.
Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes. The Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee and each of their respective Affiliates are not obliged to take any action following the publication or announcement of any such Unsolicited Ratings.
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.
Actions of any Rating Agency can Adversely Affect the Market Value or Liquidity of the Notes
The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations
The Maturity Date of the Notes is 15 January 2034 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.
3.18 Projections, Forecasts and Estimates are Forward Looking Statements and are Inherently Uncertain
Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
3.19 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes

The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority. Furthermore, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any creditors’ rights against the Issuer and will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the Trust Deed. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to the holders of subordinated Classes of Notes and in particular, the Subordinated Notes, following any liquidation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds from the Collateral to pay senior Classes of Notes and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the Issuer.
In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes, or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations, instead being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.6 “Mandatory Redemption of the Notes”.
Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.
3.20 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes
It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of an Event of Default on or about that date.
3.21 Withholding Tax on the Notes
So long as the Notes remain listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin or another recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (“TCA”) and the Notes are held in a “recognised clearing system” for the purposes of Section 64 or interest on the Notes is paid by a paying agent that is not in Ireland, no withholding tax under current law is expected to be imposed in Ireland on payments of interest on the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 9 (Taxation), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Issuer shall, subject to and in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to cure that Note Tax Event (which may include changing the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would not give rise to a Note Tax Event). If the Issuer is unable to cure the Note Tax Event, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
3.22 Book-entry Holders are not Considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed and may Delay Receipt of Payments on the Notes
Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.
Noteholders owning a book-entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “Form of the Notes”.
3.23 Security
Clearing Systems

Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities if the Custodian or its sub- custodian becomes insolvent.
In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee,
the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.
Fixed Security

Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
3.24 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers

The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution, or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.
The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. Any CM Voting Notes held by or on behalf of any Collateral Manager Related Person other than the Collateral Manager shall have voting rights with respect to, and shall be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. See 5 “Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates”.
If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. The voting threshold at any Noteholders’ meeting in respect of an Ordinary Resolution or an Extraordinary Resolution of all Noteholders is, respectively, more than 50 per cent. or at least 66⅔ per cent. of the votes cast on such Resolution. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 662/3 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, if a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum
thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.
Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.
Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.
Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class. Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.
Certain amendments, waivers and modifications to the Transaction Documents may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendments, waivers or modifications could be adverse to certain Noteholders. Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Criteria or the Collateral Quality Tests and the related definitions, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has been obtained (save in the case of certain modifications or amendments to the components of a the Moody’s Test Matrix, the S&P CDO Monitor BDR, the S&P CDO Monitor SDR or S&P Recovery Rates as specified in paragraph (xiv) of Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) and (to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) the Controlling Class has consented by way of Ordinary Resolution but without the consent of any other Class of Noteholders.
Certain entrenched rights relating to the Notes including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution, cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.
In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents which, in its opinion, are made to correct a manifest error or which are of a formal, minor or technical nature, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).

Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.
3.25 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes

If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Noteholders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).
3.26 Enforcement Rights Following an Event of Default
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) or Condition 10(a)(vii) (Illegality) such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed or the Irish Security Agreement becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), take Enforcement Action in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; (B) otherwise, in the case of an Event of Default specified in Conditions 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest), 10(a)(ii) (Non-payment of principal) or 10(a)(iv) (Collateral Obligations) the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default; or (C) in the case of any other Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes voting separately by Class by way of Ordinary Resolution may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.
3.27 Certain ERISA Considerations
Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “Certain ERISA Considerations”.
3.28 Forced Transfer
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both
a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA. The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a
U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule 144A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Holder”) or a Noteholder is a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) demanding that such Noteholder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) within 30 days (or 10 days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder) of the date of such notice. If such Noteholder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non- Permitted ERISA Holder), (a) upon direction from the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, a Transfer Agent, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to such Transfer Agent and the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.
In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that, if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
3.29 U.S. Tax Risks
Imposition of Tax on Non-U.S. Holders

Payments on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this Offering Circular titled “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consideration”) that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer (including the certifications described below under “FATCA”) and gain recognised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the payments or gain are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States or, in the case of gain, the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale, and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Holders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.
U.S. Trade or Business

Although the Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a “United States real property interest” or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to an Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it were determined that the Issuer was treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer had taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer would be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.
Additional Notes May Not Be Fungible for Tax Purposes

Any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date in accordance with Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) may not be treated as part of the same issue for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the Outstanding Notes of the same Class that were previously issued. As a result, different blocks of Notes could be treated differently for U.S. federal income tax purposes from other blocks of the same Class. If all blocks of a Class of Notes bear the same securities identifier, the Issuer and holders may not be able to distinguish between different blocks of that Class. As a result, information returns furnished to investors may not accurately reflect the amount of OID required to be accrued by them.
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer intends to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information or documentation to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Possible Treatment of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes as Equity in the Issuer for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes

The Class E Notes and the Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note or Class F Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Holders (as defined in the section of this Offering Circular titled “Tax Considerations - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective “qualified electing fund” election with respect to their Class E Notes and their Class F Notes. Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are treated as equity for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of those Notes could be subject to the rules pertaining to 10 per cent United States shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”). See the section of this Offering Circular titled “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations –
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes – Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes”.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes are Uncertain

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL

4.1 The Portfolio
The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after any Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date) (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgement and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.
Neither the Issuer nor the Placement Agent has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.
Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults
The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds as well as certain other investments lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio”.
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed
terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.
To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.
The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Collateral Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Placement Agent or the Sole Arranger may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor’s participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent or the Sole Arranger, would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent or the Sole Arranger and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder’s Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will not influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Collateral Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Obligations. Except for a right to approve purchases under the Warehouse Arrangements as described below, each of the Placement Agent and the Sole Arranger have not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date
On behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager has acquired, or entered into binding commitments to acquire, certain Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements. The Warehouse Arrangements were provided by an Affiliate of the Placement Agent as senior lender, and various subordinated lenders (some of whom could choose to invest in the Notes) (together, the “Warehouse Providers”). Some of the Collateral Obligations may have been acquired from the Warehouse Providers. The Warehouse Arrangements will be terminated in all respects on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements must be repaid by the Issue Date from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Warehouse Providers in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date.
The prices paid for such Collateral Obligations will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and the Issue Date including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”.
Although an Affiliate of the Placement Agent was involved in the Warehouse Arrangements, its involvement in such arrangements, and their approval of the purchase of assets acquired under such arrangements, was solely in its capacity as a Warehouse Provider and should not be viewed as a determination by the Placement Agent or such Affiliate as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether such asset satisfies the Eligibility Criteria applicable to the Issuer. The Affiliate of the Placement Agent’s determination to approve the acquisition of such assets was not based on any credit analysis undertaken by, or available to it in relation to such assets, and the Placement Agent and its Affiliate will not, nor are they required to, monitor the value of such assets or the creditworthiness of the Obligor of any such asset.
In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Providers on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during such period provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Providers (other than in relation to Originated Assets, in respect of which the risk will be borne by the Collateral Manager during the Seasoning Period). In addition, all net realised losses in respect of the Collateral Obligations arising during the period of the Warehouse Arrangements will also be for the Issuer’s account.
For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.
The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Obligation is entered into and any failure by such obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action (other than in the case of Issue Date Collateral Obligations).
4.4 Acquisitions of Collateral Obligations

For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.
The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only (i) at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Obligation is entered into, (ii) in respect of Issue Date Collateral Obligations, on the Issue Date and (iii) in respect of certain of the Eligibility Criteria that comprise the Restructured Obligation Criteria, those Collateral Obligations which are the subject of a restructuring (whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor), on the applicable Restructuring Date, and, in each case, any failure by such Collateral Obligation to satisfy the relevant Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.
4.5 Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period

During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy, as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after any Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date), Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions, international political events and other macroeconomic events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions upon the acquisition of Non- Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Asset Swap Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Asset Swap Transactions. See also 2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Asset Swap Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.
Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.6 The Target Par Amount
As of the Effective Date, the Issuer is required to have acquired, or entered into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that for the purposes of determining such Aggregate Principal Balance, any repayments or prepayments of Collateral Obligations not subsequently reinvested subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation shall be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value). If the Target Par Amount has not been reached on the Effective Date an Effective Date Rating Event may occur pursuant to the Conditions which may in certain circumstances lead to an early redemption of the Notes.
4.7 Prepayment Risk

Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or make whole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable
interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made. The rate of prepayments, amortisation and defaults may be influenced by various factors including:
 changes in Obligor performance and requirements for capital;
 the level of interest rates;
 lack of credit being extended and/or the tightening of credit underwriting standards in the commercial lending industry; and
 the overall economic environment, including any fluctuations in the recovery from the current economic conditions.
The Issuer cannot predict the actual rate of prepayments, accelerated amortisation or defaults which will be experienced with respect to the Collateral Obligations. As a result, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for any investor that requires a regular or predictable schedule of principal payments.
Bonds frequently have call or redemption features (with or without a premium or make whole) that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date.
Repayments on bonds may be caused by a variety of factors which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such repayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a repayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and may be acquired in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by holders of the Notes and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.
4.8 Defaults and Recoveries
The Collateral Obligations will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in non-investment grade loans and bonds, which are subject to liquidity, market value, credit, interest rate, reinvestment and certain other risks. It is anticipated that the Collateral Obligations generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade corporate obligations. These risks could be exacerbated to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in one or more particular types of Collateral Obligations.
Prices of the Collateral Obligations may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, prevailing credit spreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The current uncertainty affecting the European economy and the economies of countries in which issuers of the Collateral Obligations are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the value and performance of the Collateral Obligations. Additionally, loans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organised exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customised, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the debt securities market.
There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any
particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.
A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors (including any such analysis prepared by the Placement Agent for or at the direction of investors) in determining whether to purchase the Notes.
In some European jurisdictions (including the UK), obligors or lenders may seek a “scheme of arrangement”. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms.
Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See 4.26 “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations”.
It is a requirement of the rating of the Rated Notes that Collateral Obligations that are to constitute Restructured Obligations following a restructuring satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria on the applicable Restructuring Date. Such requirement may result in Collateral Obligations ceasing to be Collateral Obligations following a restructuring of the terms thereof.
For the purpose of the foregoing “Senior Obligations” means Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Obligations.
4.9 Underlying Portfolio
Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, not less than 90 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Loans or Secured Senior Bonds (which term shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.
Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.
Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.
Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at 4.20 “Interest Rate Risk”.
The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior
Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan.
However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.
Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations

In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations

The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.
Mezzanine Obligations are likely to be subject to intercreditor arrangements that may include restrictions on the ability of the holders of the relevant Mezzanine Obligations from taking independent enforcement action.
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds

High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for High Yield Bonds.
High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.
The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.
European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.
In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by Obligors with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.26 “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations”. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Transaction Documents, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks

The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in- possession” financings.
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Obligations

The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Obligations. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Obligations occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.
4.10 Corporate Rescue Loans
Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a
company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.
Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan may be unsecured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.
4.11 Bridge Loans
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.
4.12 Collateral Enhancement Obligations
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time as well as from Contributions by Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.
The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.
To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, an “Collateral Manager Advance”) to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
4.13 Workout Obligations

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time, purchase Workout Obligations subject to and in accordance with the Conditions and the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement including the following limitations:
(i) the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Workout Obligations acquired with Principal Proceeds and held by the Issuer as of any date (i) during the first calendar year following the Issue Date, shall not exceed 2.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; (ii) during the first calendar quarter thereafter, shall not exceed 2.25 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; and (iii) during each calendar quarter thereafter, shall not exceed an amount equal to the limit applicable during the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus 0.25 per cent. of the Target Par Amount;
(ii) the cumulative aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Workout Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or after the Issue Date with Principal Proceeds (for the avoidance of doubt whether or not any such Workout Obligation continues to be held by the Issuer) shall not exceed 10.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; and
(iii) the cumulative aggregate principal amount outstanding (and in the case of any obligation other than a debt obligation, the nominal value thereof as reasonably determined by the Collateral Manager) of all Workout Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or after the Issue Date with Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds (for the avoidance of doubt whether or not any such Workout Obligation continues to be held by the Issuer) shall not exceed 10.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Workout Obligations may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account, the Interest Account or the Principal Account at the relevant time, in each case subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.
Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account), the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account shall be comprised of all sums deposited in such account from time to time which will include: (i) interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account during the Reinvestment Period, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders, as a Collateral Enhancement Amount subject to the limits set out in the definition thereof; and (ii) the amount of any Collateral Manager Advance contributed by the Collateral Manager and deposited into the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed.
Workout Obligations may be sold at any time by the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, and all sale proceeds (and other Distributions) received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Interest Account or the Principal Account in each case subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.
For the avoidance of doubt, Workout Obligations shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and none of the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria or Restructured Obligation Criteria shall be required to be satisfied in connection with the purchase thereof, save that, in accordance with the definition thereof (i) Principal Proceeds Workout Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on any date on or after their date of acquisition shall, on and with effect from such date, be deemed to be Collateral Obligations for the purposes of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (and all associated provisions and definitions); and (ii) where sub-paragraph (i) does not apply, Principal Proceeds Workout Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria (other than the criteria set out at paragraphs (c), (f), (g), (i), (j), (m), (n), (v), (w), (z), (aa), (dd), (ee), (ff)) on any date on or after their date of acquisition shall, on and with effect from such date (and notwithstanding any definition or provision of these Conditions, excluding for the avoidance of doubt, proviso (i) above) at all times be deemed to be Defaulted Obligations for the purposes of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (and all associated provisions and definitions).
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may notify the Issuer in writing (which may be by way of email) no later than 10 Business Days following the acquisition thereof, as to whether or not any Workout Obligation purchased with Interest Proceeds
or amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Conditions, is to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation (and if the Collateral Manager so notifies the Issuer that the relevant Workout Obligation (i) is to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation, then it shall be treated (irrevocably) as such; or (ii) is not to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation, then it shall (irrevocably) not be treated as such); provided that if the Collateral Manager does not so notify the Issuer within such timeframe, then the relevant Workout Obligation shall be treated (irrevocably) as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation.
4.14 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations
As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
4.15 Participations, Novations and Assignments
The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.
The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.
Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer
would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. If the Selling Institution selling a Participation becomes insolvent, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.
In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See
2.22 “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive”.
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (excluding any Defaulted Obligations).
4.16 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders
The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.
4.17 Counterparty Risk
Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.
If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will generally be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy as results in the rating of the Rated Notes being
maintained at their then current level within the remedy period specified in the ratings criteria of the Rating Agencies.
Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction (see 4.20 “Interest Rate Risk” and 4.21 “Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions – Currency Risk”). For further information, see the section of this Offering Circular titled “Hedging Arrangements”.
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See 2.22 “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive”.
4.18 Concentration Risk
Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio – Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”. Although the resulting diversification of Collateral may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.
4.19 Credit Risk

Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.
4.20 Interest Rate Risk

The Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. The Class B-2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.
In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain.
As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, floating rate basis mismatch, maturity date mismatch and/or mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such interest rate hedge is a Form Approved Interest Rate Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer’s exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “Hedging Arrangements”.
If a significant number of Collateral Obligations pay interest on a semi-annual basis there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and reset risks, respectively.
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.
To the extent that the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in obligors in respect of financial instruments held by the Issuer as Eligible Investments incurring negative deposit rates as a result of having issued such instruments and whilst such instruments remain outstanding, the Issuer (as holder of such instruments) may also be required to compensate the relevant obligors for such chargeable interest incurred in the form of a mandatory reduction in the principal amount outstanding of such instruments in accordance with their terms.
The Issuer has established the Principal Reduction Reserve Account for the purposes of covering any Principal Reductions. The Principal Reduction Reserve Account will be funded after the Issue Date and replenished at the Collateral Manager’s discretion (acting in accordance with the standard of care required under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) out of (amongst other sources) Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments on a senior
basis, subject to a cap of €50,000 per annum (or, if lower, the amount (if any) of the Senior Expenses Cap remaining after the payment of all Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments). The Collateral Manager may also fund the Principal Reduction Reserve Account on a subordinated basis (but senior to payments on the Subordinated Notes) in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments to the extent necessary, in its reasonable discretion, to fund anticipated Principal Reductions for the current Due Period.
Accordingly, payments made into the Principal Reduction Reserve Account in order to cover anticipated Principal Reductions as described above, may have a negative impact on amounts available to the Issuer to apply as interest payments on the Notes. In addition, whilst the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) is only permitted to invest in Eligible Investments to the extent that amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Reduction Reserve Account at the time of investment will be sufficient, in the Collateral Manager’s reasonable determination, to cover anticipated Principal Reductions for the applicable Due Period, there can be no guarantee that such amounts will be sufficient to cover all Principal Reductions that may arise, and the occurrence of Principal Reductions in respect of Eligible Investments may therefore negatively affect the Aggregate Collateral Balance (and the Par Value Ratios).
The calculation of EURIBOR on the Floating Rate Notes is subject to a floor of zero, and holders of such Notes, notwithstanding that the rate of EURIBOR reaches such floor, will remain entitled to receive no less than the Applicable Margin.
4.21 Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions – Currency Risk
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 25 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Non-Euro Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limit set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. The Issuer is required to enter into an Asset Swap Transaction in respect of each Non-Euro Obligation.
Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations may be subject to Asset Swap Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non-Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Asset Swap Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Asset Swap Counterparties willing to provide Asset Swap Transactions. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Asset Swap Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Asset Swap Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non- Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Asset Swap Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Asset Swap Counterparty. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Asset Swap Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See
2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),” 2.7 “U.S. Swap Regulations” and 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”.
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Asset Swap Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes. In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial up- front payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.
The Issuer will depend upon the Asset Swap Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Asset Swap Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise,
the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Asset Swap Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.
4.22 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances

To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.
During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds - see
3.8 “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period”. The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Portfolio. Any decrease in the yield of the Portfolio will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that if the Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest
payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.
4.23 Rising Interest Rates may Render some Obligors Unable to pay Interest on their Collateral Obligations
Most of the Collateral Obligations bear interest at floating interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by the related Obligors will also increase. As prevailing interest rates increase, some Obligors may not be able to make the increased interest payments on Collateral Obligations or refinance their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligations, resulting in payment defaults, Defaulted Obligations and an inability of the Issuer to make payment on some or all Classes of Notes. Conversely if interest rates decline, Obligors may refinance their Collateral Obligations at lower interest rates which could shorten the average life of the Notes.
4.24 Balloon Obligations and Bullet Obligations Present Refinancing Risk
The Collateral may consist of Collateral Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligation on a timely basis or at all.
4.25 Ratings on Collateral Obligations
Credit ratings of Collateral Obligations represent the rating agencies’ opinions regarding their credit quality but are not a guarantee of such quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Obligations and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a credit rating assigned to any Collateral Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Obligations that the Issuer holds from time to time will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward.
The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Moody’s Caa Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating. In some instances, the Moody’s Rating and the
S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Moody’s and S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the Moody’s Rating or the S&P Rating is derived from the rating of another rating agency and vice versa. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See the sections of this Offering Circular titled “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.
There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised as at the date of this Offering Circular despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Moody’s Caa Obligations and S&P CCC Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates (provided that, in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, such Determination Date is on or after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date), which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf), from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.26 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations
Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, if the relevant Obligor becomes insolvent.
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.
4.27 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination
In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.
In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.
Because Affiliates of, or Persons related to, the Collateral Manager may hold equity or other interests in Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the Issuer could be exposed to claims for equitable subordination or lender liability or both based on such equity or other holdings.
The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.
4.28 Loan Repricing

Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.
4.29 Withholding Tax on the Collateral Obligations

At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than withholding imposed under FATCA and U.S. withholding taxes on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, extension fees, or similar fees) under current market practice or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can be eliminated or reclaimed by application being made under an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise; or (ii) the Obligor is required to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the Obligor or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross.
A large number of double tax treaties which Ireland is a party to have recently been amended or will be amended in the future as part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. In particular a new rule is being added which will deny a treaty
benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. If this rule applies the Issuer will not be able to take advantage of the relevant double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made.
If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole
– Subordinated Noteholders).
4.30 Collateral Manager

The Collateral Manager is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See the sections of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio” and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The powers and duties of the Collateral Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Impaired Obligation); and
(c) the participation in restructuring and work-outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio”. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time will, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, be limited to a review of readily available public information and in respect of Collateral Obligations which are bonds which are not publicly listed, any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of bonds and, in respect of Collateral Obligations which are Assignments or Participations of senior and mezzanine loans and in relation to which the Collateral Manager has non-public information, such analysis will include due diligence of the kind common in relation to loans of such kind. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Obligations will be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of assets.
In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.
The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than entry into the Warehouse Arrangements. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.
The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives,
leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.
The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.
In addition, the Collateral Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described in the section of this Offering Circular titled “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.
The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.
4.31 No Placement Agent Role Post-Closing
The Placement Agent takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Placement Agent or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity. While the Placement Agent may own a portion of certain Classes of Rated Notes on the Issue Date and may own Notes at any time, it has no obligation to make any investment in any Notes and may sell at any time any Notes it does purchase. See also 5 “Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates”.
4.32 Trading Gains

The Collateral Manager may, in its discretion, direct that any Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments are instead deposited into the Interest Account, subject to certain conditions, including the aggregate amount of Trading Gains deposited into the Interest Account being no greater than 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. See Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account).
In either case, such Trading Gains may not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.
4.33 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations
The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals at least approximately €296,500,000 (representing approximately 98.8 per cent. of the Target Par Amount). The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including,
without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be paid into the Collection Account and used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be transferred from the Collection Account and retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations during the Initial Investment Period (as defined in the Conditions). The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes. There is no assurance that the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria, as applicable.
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 15 June 2021, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Equity Security or Workout Obligation, a Credit Impaired Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
4.34 Valuation Information; Limited Information

None of the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee, or Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. The Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders. In particular, the Collateral Manager will not have any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Collateral Obligations, except as may be required in connection with the regular reports prepared by the Issuer (or the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trust Deed.
The Noteholders and the Trustee will not have any right to inspect any records relating to the Collateral Obligations, and the Collateral Manager will not be obligated to disclose any further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Obligations, unless (i) specifically required by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or
(ii) following its receipt of a written request from the Trustee, the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion determines that the disclosure of such further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Obligation to the Trustee would not be prohibited by applicable law or the Underlying Instruments relating to such Collateral Obligation, in which case the Collateral Manager will disclose such further information or evidence to the Trustee; provided that (a) the
Trustee will not disclose such further information or evidence to any third party except (i) to the extent disclosure may be required by law or any governmental or regulatory authority; and (ii) to the extent that the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations under the Trust Deed. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager may, with respect to any information that it elects to disclose, demand that persons receiving such information execute confidentiality agreements before being provided with the information.
5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Placement Agent and its Affiliates and the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The activities of the Rating Agencies in connection with the transaction described herein may also give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
Collateral Manager

Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates

The following briefly summarises certain potential and actual conflicts of interest which are likely to arise from the overall activities of the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and their Related Entities (as defined below), but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
Although the Collateral Manager and certain of its officers and personnel will devote such time and effort as the Collateral Manager deems appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties to the Issuer under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, they will not devote all of their working time to the affairs of the Issuer. As part of their regular business, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and their respective Affiliates and any respective officers and employees of such entities hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions for their respective accounts, for the account of the Issuer and for the accounts of their Related Entities and others in which the Issuer has no interest, on a principal or agency basis, with respect to loans, investments and any other financial instruments. Such other accounts will have investment objectives, programs, strategies and positions that are similar or dissimilar to or conflict with those of the Issuer. Also, such other accounts will invest in businesses that compete with, have interests adverse to, or are affiliated with the obligors on loans or other obligations held by the Issuer, which could adversely affect the performance of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and its Related Entities may invest in the Notes issued by the Issuer or could elect to bid at any auction of Defaulted Obligations or Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their Affiliates also provide investment advisory services for a negotiated fee to obligors who may or may not be Affiliates or Related Entities with respect to the Collateral Manager and whose loans are Collateral Obligations, and neither the Noteholders, nor the Issuer shall have any right to such fees. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their Affiliates receive fees or other benefits for these services which are greater than and in addition to any fees the Collateral Manager is receiving for its services to the Issuer. This disparity in fee income creates potential conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager’s obligations to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s interest in generating fee income. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager may waive, rebate or share all or a portion of its Collateral Management Fees with any Person as it may agree or as may otherwise be required by applicable law. From time to time, the Collateral Manager enters into arrangements with, or establishes private investment vehicles for, certain clients, including Related Entities, pursuant to which the Collateral Manager is compensated through a sharing of fees and remuneration earned by such clients in connection with specific investment recommendations of the Collateral Manager. Such arrangements could result in an incentive for the Collateral Manager to favour the interests of such clients relative to the interests of the Issuer. No Noteholder will have the right to review or to receive the economic or other benefits of any such arrangement to which such Noteholder is not a party. Any such arrangements affect the incentives of the Collateral Manager in managing the Collateral Obligations and also affect the incentives of any Noteholders benefitting from such arrangements in taking actions that such Noteholders may be permitted to take under the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including votes concerning amendments to the Transaction Documents and the removal for “Cause” (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) of the Collateral Manager. Subject to compliance with the Collateral Manager’s internal policies and procedures, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates also carry on
investment activities for their own accounts and for family members and friends who do not invest in the Issuer, and give advice and recommend investments or strategies to Related Entities and such advice and recommendations can differ from advice given to, or action taken with respect to investments and any other type of financial instrument recommended for or held by, the Issuer, even though their investment objectives are the same or similar.
As mentioned above, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities provide investment advisory services, among other services, that are substantially similar to and competitive with the Issuer. The operation of such competing businesses could conflict with and adversely affect the performance and operation of the Issuer and the Collateral Obligations by, among other things, impacting the value and availability of investment opportunities available to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their Affiliates and/or officers and employees of such entities will not be restricted in their ability to expand their business, services offering, operations, or in the types of investments which they may make. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities have economic interests in, or other relationships with, issuers in whose obligations or credit exposures the Issuer could invest. In particular, such Persons may invest, or may have already invested, in other financial instruments that are senior or junior to, or pari passu with, certain obligations or financial instruments of the same issuer that are held by the Issuer (e.g., another account advised by the Collateral Manager acquires senior debt while the Issuer acquires subordinated debt) or in which partners, security holders, officers, directors, agents or employees of such Persons serve on boards of directors or otherwise have ongoing relationships. Accordingly, investment by the Issuer in such obligations or instruments could also benefit the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities or other clients of the Collateral Manager or CBAM U.S. Each of such ownership and other relationships and business operations could result in restrictions imposed by law or internal policies on the investment activities by the Collateral Manager for the Issuer and otherwise create conflicts of interest for the Issuer. In such instances, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities could in their discretion make investment recommendations and decisions that are the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer’s investments. In connection with any such activities described above, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions in investments of a type that are suitable to be included as Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or any officers and employees of such entities will not be required to offer such investments to the Issuer or provide notice of such activities to the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or certain of their respective Affiliates serve as a general partner, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager of partnerships or companies organised to issue collateralised bond or loan obligations secured by non-investment grade bank loans. In such instances the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their respective Affiliates could give advice or take action with respect to such investments which differs from the advice given or the timing or nature of any action taken with respect to the investments of the Issuer. As a result of such advice or actions, the prices and availability of other financial investments in which the Issuer invests or may seek to invest, and the performance of the Issuer, may be adversely affected.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or their Related Entities have invested and expect to continue to invest in debt obligations that would also be appropriate as Collateral Obligations and purchase or sell such obligations and other financial instruments for or on behalf of themselves and their Related Entities without purchasing or selling such obligations and other financial instruments for the Issuer and may purchase or sell other financial instruments for the Issuer without purchasing or selling such other financial instruments for themselves or their Related Entities. Accordingly, the performance of Related Entities and other clients of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer will differ. Neither the Collateral Manager nor any Affiliate has any duty, in making or maintaining such investments, to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any such opportunity to the Issuer. The investment policies, fee arrangements and other circumstances applicable to such other parties may vary from those applicable to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or their Related Entities are not restricted from forming additional investment funds, from entering into other investment advisory relationships or from engaging in other business activities, even though such activities will be in competition with the Collateral Manager’s responsibility to manage the Collateral Obligations and/or involve substantial time and resources of certain partners, officers or employees of the Collateral Manager. These activities could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest in that the time and effort of the principals of the Collateral Manager,
CBAM U.S. or their respective Affiliates and any officers and employees of such entities will not be devoted exclusively to the business of the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or their Affiliates, but will be allocated between the business of the Collateral Manager and the services provided to their other clients. Further, such other activities could generate higher fees, which also gives rise to conflicts of interest.
Unless prohibited by applicable law, the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or certain documentation with respect to other clients of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager may make investments that result in the payment of fees or remuneration other than management or incentive compensation for its advisory services to the Issuer, any Affiliate or Related Entity of the Collateral Manager or CBAM U.S. or to any other client in which the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or any Affiliate or Related Entity of the Collateral Manager or CBAM U.S. has a pecuniary interest. The Collateral Manager, in such instances, may allocate the commitment portion and the syndicate portion of any such transaction to different clients, in accordance with its applicable internal policies and procedures (as such policies and procedures may change from time to time in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, the “Internal Policies”), which Internal Policies are deemed, in the judgment of the Collateral Manager, to be fair and equitable in the aggregate over time. Subject to applicable law, the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their Affiliates or Related Entities may retain some or all fees, consideration or compensation, including fees relating to arranger, syndication, agency, origination, sourcing, structuring, collateral management, advisory, commitment, facility, float or other services in connection with investments made on behalf of any client of the Collateral Manager and its other clients (including the Issuer) may not receive any benefit in connection with such fees. Except as required by the Transaction Documents, such fees or remuneration generally are in addition to and do not reduce or offset the fees paid in connection with the Collateral Manager’s advisory services under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The receipt of such fees by the Collateral Manager, CBAM
U.S. or any of their respective Affiliates or Related Entities could potentially create an incentive to make investments that give rise to additional compensation in connection with transactions unrelated to the transaction contemplated hereunder and under the Trust Deed.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or Related Entities are engaged in loan origination, loan syndication, asset financing and loan servicing businesses and receive a fee in connection with such activities. Subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is not prohibited from acquiring such loans on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer should not expect to participate in the fees or compensation received by the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or Related Entities in connection with such businesses. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and/or Related Entities also have or could establish relationships with companies whose debt obligations or other financial instruments are included in the assets and could, now or in the future, own or seek to acquire such obligations or other financial instruments issued by issuers of certain debt obligations and other financial instruments included in the assets, and the holders or beneficial owners of such debt obligations and other financial instruments may have interests different from or adverse to the investments that are Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or any of their respective Affiliates organise and manage one or more entities with objectives similar to or different from those of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or any of their Affiliates will also provide other advisory services for a customary fee to other entities, and neither the Noteholders nor the Issuer will have any right to such fees. Some clients (including Related Entities) and investors and prospective clients and investors request and receive, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, more specific and detailed portfolio information concerning a given portfolio or the strategy and specific investments with respect to such a portfolio, than is routinely provided to other clients in general or specifically with respect to the same portfolio. The Collateral Manager provides such information in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of any engagements that the Collateral Manager enters into after the Issue Date with other clients and the Collateral Manager will have no obligation or commitment to provide the same or similar information to all clients, including the Issuer for the benefit of the Noteholders. As such, there can be no assurance that the quality, amount nor the frequency of delivery of any such information furnished to any clients or investors (or prospective clients or investors) by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or any of their respective Affiliates will be the same or similar among its clients, including the Issuer for the benefit of the Noteholders. Similarly, the Collateral Manager has no obligation to provide written commentary, research or other communications or analysis to any client regardless of whether any such information may be provided to other clients. In connection
with the foregoing activities, the Collateral Manager and/or any Affiliate from time to time may come into possession of material non public information (“Inside Information”) that could restrict by law, internal policies or otherwise, the Collateral Manager from effecting transactions or taking other actions that otherwise might have been initiated on behalf of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Manager will generally make its investment decisions on behalf of the Issuer based on public information. In an effort to avoid restrictions for the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s, CBAM U.S.’s and their respective Affiliates’ other clients, the Collateral Manager generally elects not to obtain access to Inside Information concerning any issuer or obligor of the Issuer’s investments. As a result, in such instances, the Collateral Manager does not possess all of the information relating to an issuer or obligor that other investors in securities or obligations of such issuers or obligors could have, and consequently the Collateral Manager will from time to time take actions or refrain from taking actions on behalf of the Issuer that it would not take or refrain from taking were it in possession of such Inside Information known to other market participants. As a result, the Issuer’s performance could be adversely affected. Because the actions taken by the Collateral Manager on behalf of its other clients conflict with the interests of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, in order to manage such conflicts, could elect to abstain from making an investment or taking an action which in some cases could be to the benefit of or the detriment of the Issuer.
Furthermore, the Collateral Manager’s ability to advise the Issuer to buy obligations for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell obligations which are part of the Portfolio will be restricted by limitations contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed and due to other activity undertaken by the Collateral Manager on behalf of other clients. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Issuer will be unable to buy or sell obligations or to take other actions that the Collateral Manager might consider in the best economic interests of the Portfolio. The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S, and/or any of their respective Affiliates or Related Entities will engage in other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others, which may include, without limitation, serving as collateral manager or investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being Affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by securities such as the Notes and other trusts and pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with obligations issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others or effect transactions on behalf of itself or others that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer, and the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their respective Affiliates and Related Entities that have furnished (and expect to continue to furnish) investment management and advisory services to others who have investment policies similar to those followed by the Collateral Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own obligations which are the same type as the Collateral Obligations. For example, the Collateral Manager may purchase an asset for the Issuer while simultaneously selling the same or related asset for another client, an Affiliate or a Related Entity.
Any such separately managed accounts or funds advised by the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their respective Affiliates could require the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their respective Affiliates to apply a different valuation methodology in valuing specific investments than the valuation methodology set forth in the Transaction Documents for the Issuer. As a result of such different methodology, the value of certain investments held in such separately managed accounts or funds managed by the Collateral Manager will differ from the value assigned under the Transaction Documents to the same investments held by the Issuer.
To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Collateral Manager expects to, on behalf of the Issuer and subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, for liquidity, trade allocation or other reasons, purchase debt obligations and other financial instruments from, sell debt obligations and other financial instruments to, or enter into any client cross-transaction with any of its clients, partners, members or their employees and their Affiliates, and any investment vehicles, funds, accounts or similar entities advised by the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates (collectively, the “Related Entities”) in order to further the investment programs of certain accounts or funds managed by the Collateral Manager, or for other reasons consistent with the investment and operating guidelines of such funds or accounts. In addition, with the prior authorisation of the Issuer, which can be revoked at any time, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, in which case any such Affiliate may receive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both parties to the transaction. To the extent that a cross-transaction may be viewed as a principal transaction due to the Collateral Manager’s, CBAM U.S.’s or any respective Affiliate’s ownership interest in another account advised by it or any of its Affiliates, the Collateral Manager will seek to comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act, as applicable.
The Issuer could acquire from time to time Collateral Obligations selected by the Collateral Manager from one or more other collateralised debt obligation or similar transactions for which the Collateral Manager or one of its Affiliates serves as collateral manager or investment manager. Such transactions in some circumstances could be deemed principal transactions governed by the Investment Advisers Act. Any such principal transactions will be effected in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, subject to applicable law, including, where applicable, a requirement that the Issuer provide consent prior to settlement of the transaction. By its investment in the Notes, each investor will be deemed to have consented to this procedure.
The Collateral Manager is expected to purchase a minority (by principal amount) of each tranche of Notes on the Issue Date (including, but not limited to the case of the Retention Holder holding and retaining the Retention Notes pursuant to the Risk Retention Letter for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements) and it is expected that the Collateral Manager and one or more Affiliates of the Collateral Manager will purchase 100 per cent. of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes. The Collateral Manager and certain of its Affiliates and Related Entities may purchase additional Notes at any time on or after the Issue Date, subject to the applicable restrictions set forth in the Trust Deed. Any Notes owned by the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates or Related Entities may be sold by such party or parties to related and unrelated parties at any time after the Issue Date, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed. Although the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates and Related Entities may at times be Noteholders, the interests and incentives thereof will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of the other Noteholders, including holders of the same Class or Classes.
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of, voting on any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. Any CM Voting Notes held by or on behalf of any Collateral Manager Related Person other than the Collateral Manager shall have voting rights with respect to, and shall be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution.
In the event that any Originated Asset (as defined in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below) fails to meet the Eligibility Criteria within 15 Business Days of the date upon which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation, the Issuer shall have the right to require the Collateral Manager to purchase from it the relevant Originated Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Originated Asset, in accordance with the terms summarised in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations” below. The Noteholders, by their acquisition of the Notes, will be deemed to have consented to the foregoing.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their respective Affiliates could make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of its Related Entities which differ from those effected with respect to the Issuer and the Portfolio. The Collateral Manager will often be seeking simultaneously to purchase or sell investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as investment manager (including Related Entities) and the Collateral Manager will have the discretion to apportion such purchases or sales among such entities. Related Entities are expected to hold (at the recommendation or direction of the Collateral Manager) some of the same investments as the Issuer. Related Entities and other clients of the Collateral Manager are likely to acquire any such investments on terms more or less favourable than the terms on which the Issuer acquired such investments. As such, the Collateral Manager cannot assure equal treatment or investment results across its investment clients. When the Collateral Manager determines that it would be appropriate for the Issuer and one or more Related Entities to participate in an investment opportunity or sell an investment, the Collateral Manager will seek to execute orders for all of the participating investment accounts, including the Issuer and its own account, consistent with its Internal Policies.
The Collateral Manager advises, or will advise, multiple clients with similar investment strategies. If an investment opportunity would be appropriate for more than one such client, the Collateral Manager will determine in its sole discretion which clients will participate in the investment opportunity and to what extent. This results in a client receiving no allocation of a particular investment or receiving an allocation of an investment which is less than it would otherwise have received if the Collateral Manager did not have multiple clients. Where the Collateral Manager recommends an investment opportunity to both the Issuer and another client, which client could be Affiliated with the Collateral Manager, conflicts can arise, including but not limited to conflicts related to the allocation of disposition opportunities and conflicts related to voting or other actions vis-à-vis obligors (including a situation where an Affiliated client has no incentive to vote in the same manner as the Issuer or has an incentive to vote against the Issuer with respect to an investment opportunity recommended by the Collateral Manager). The Collateral Manager has adopted policies and procedures designed to allocate investment opportunities to clients in a manner it deems to be fair and equitable taken as a whole (including, a complete opt-out of an allocation) over time, consistent with the client’s investment strategy, guidelines and objectives. Accordingly, the Collateral Manager will weigh factors it deems relevant when determining which client portfolios will receive particular investment allocations and to what extent. Such factors include, among others, investment objectives, target returns/yields, risk tolerance, investment guidelines and metrics, limitations and restrictions, market conditions, internal investment policies, expected duration of the investment, maturity constraints, cash positions or needs, existing and target issuer and industry exposures, issue size, tax gains/losses and any other factor deemed relevant by the Collateral Manager in good faith. There is no assurance that any or all of these factors will be considered when making allocation decisions or that each factor will be weighed equally. As such, there is no assurance that the Issuer will hold the same investments or the same amount of an investment as the other clients of the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Manager’s policy affords it substantial discretion in allocating investment opportunities and such discretion will affect performance. Certain clients may not participate in the gains or losses realised by other clients with similar investment objectives and there is no assurance that all client portfolios will hold the same positions or will perform similarly, even when clients share the same investment strategy and/or investment objective.
In certain circumstances, when allocating orders, the Collateral Manager’s focus on constructing fully invested portfolios results in (i) certain investment preference being given to new clients, (ii) allocating certain investments to accounts or vehicles and certain other actions in connection with the EU Retention Requirements, (iii) allocating one or more investments to CLO warehouse vehicles or other proprietary or client accounts that maintain such investments temporarily in anticipation of contributing such investment(s) to a newly organised CLO or other pooled investment vehicle and/or (iv) making such investments available to certain clients who have or are expected to have a substantial amount of cash to invest/ramp up. In other circumstances, additional preferential consideration will be given to clients, including the Related Entities, responsible for sourcing or identifying a particular investment opportunity or group of investment opportunities. Clients that receive such consideration relative to other clients include those where the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S., their Related Entities, existing investors, prospects, or principals and employees of the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their Related Entities and other Affiliated parties may have a financial interest, which interest could be substantial. These clients can include those whose investments have been seeded by the Collateral Manager or its Related Entities, or accounts that are or have been used to satisfy the EU Retention Requirements or that maintain warehoused assets. Allocations to certain such client accounts and to those accounts with performance-based fees or compensation or higher fee rates will result in an increased economic benefit to the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and their Related Entities. To the extent that a client does not participate in an allocation or a bunched order, but seeks to purchase the investment at a later time, this client could receive a better or worse execution or not be able to execute at all.
As set forth above, pro rata allocation of investment opportunities should not be expected. Further, because each allocation decision is determined based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of allocation, the Collateral Manager does not subscribe to a single methodology to make its allocations. There can be no assurance that any particular investment opportunity will be allocated in a particular manner and further, the Collateral Manager may employ allocation methodologies which differ from, or are inconsistent with, previously used methodologies. Investment opportunities that are presented to the Related Entities (other than the Collateral Manager) or their officers, directors, employees or agents, do not fall within the Collateral Manager’s allocation policies and procedures to the extent they are not presented directly to the Collateral Manager.
The Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their Related Entities, from time to time, acquire, hold, or sell for their own accounts, investments which are also appropriate for clients. The Collateral Manager is not required to offer these investment opportunities to its clients or share with or inform them of such opportunities before the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or their Related Entities make such investments. Further, there is the possibility that the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or their Related Entities will invest in opportunities that the Collateral Manager declined to recommend for client investment, including the Issuer. Accordingly, there will be instances where all or substantially all of an investment opportunity will be allocated to the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or their Related Entities but not to unaffiliated clients, including the Issuer. This results in the potential for an increased economic benefit to the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. or their Related Entities.
If the Collateral Manager determines to purchase or sell the same security or obligation for more than one of the accounts it advises, the Collateral Manager may, but is not obligated to, aggregate orders placed simultaneously in an effort to seek best execution and reduce transaction costs to the extent permitted by applicable law. There can be no assurance that such aggregation will reduce costs or result in best execution.
The Collateral Manager may participate in official and unofficial creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or workout of issuers of Collateral Obligations. In such circumstances, the Collateral Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or its Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Obligations.
The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral, and the Collateral Manager is required to comply with these restrictions contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral or to take other actions which it might consider in the best economic interests of the portfolio of Collateral, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager will be permitted to discuss the composition and performance of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations and other assets with CBAM U.S., Related Entities, Affiliates, Noteholders, potential Noteholders and other stakeholders in the transaction, including actual or potential clients or investors, which may influence the Collateral Manager’s performance of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, and the Collateral Manager will be permitted to use the Issuer’s track-record and investment performance in its marketing materials and disclosures in connection with its investment management business. There can be no assurance that any such discussions will not influence the Collateral Manager’s decisions. Further, such discussions will not be shared with the Noteholders.
Other present and future activities of the Collateral Manager, CBAM U.S. and/or their respective Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.
Rating Agencies

Moody’s, KBRA and S&P have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as is the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Placement Agent and its Affiliates

Citigroup Global Markets Limited and its Affiliates (the “Citi Parties”) will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction, as a financing party in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, and in other roles described below.
The Citi Parties have formulated and developed the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests and Priorities of Payment and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. These may be influenced by discussions that the Placement Agent may have or have had with one or more investors and there is no assurance that
investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes.
Citigroup Global Markets Limited will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a lower fee being paid to the Placement Agent in respect of those Notes. The Citi Parties may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Citi Parties expect to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Citi Parties may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market. The Citi Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.
In carrying out its obligations as Placement Agent or any other transaction party, no Citi Party shall be under any duty to disclose to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholders, prospective investor or any other person, any non public information acquired in the course of carrying on any business for, or in connection with, the provision of services to any other party. The Citi Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed, underwritten or syndicated certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. The financial services that the Citi Parties provide also include financing and, as such, the Citi Parties may provide financing to the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates and such financing may directly or indirectly involve financing of the Retention Notes. In the case of such financing, the Citi Parties will receive security over assets of the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates, including security over the Retention Notes, resulting in the Citi Parties having enforcement rights and remedies which will include the right to appropriate or sell the Retention Notes. When exercising its rights in connection with such financing, the relevant Citi Party may seek to enforce its security over all or some of the Retention Notes and take possession or sell such Retention Notes to a third party. In such circumstances, the Collateral Manager may not be able to comply with its undertakings related to the EU Retention Requirements which may (i) have adverse implications for investors who are subject to the EU Retention Requirements including, without limitation, the imposition of penal capital charges on the securities held by such investors and (ii) negatively affect the liquidity and, correspondingly, the value of the Notes. In addition, the Citi Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of such financing. In addition, the Citi Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Citi Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the holders of the Notes or any other party including, without limitation, in deciding whether to enforce its security granted in connection with any financing. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors affiliated with the Citi Parties or in which one or more Citi Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Citi Party’s own investments in such Obligors.
From time to time the Collateral Manager will purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Citi Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Citi Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participation interests and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Citi Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser and/or collateral manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.
The Citi Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business,
Citi Parties and employees or customers of the Citi Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to or referencing the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Citi Party becomes an owner of or obtains exposure to any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Citi Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Citi Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the initial offer price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.
The Placement Agent takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer, and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Collateral or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and will have no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer (respectively). If the Placement Agent or its Affiliates own Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owners of Notes in actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.
By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.
6. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c 6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Holder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. See 3.28 “Forced Transfer”.
7. RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER UNDER IRISH LAW

7.1 Lack of Operating History
The Issuer is a recently incorporated designated activity company with limited liability under Irish law that has no prior operating history or revenues upon which may be used to evaluate its likely performance and the performance of the Notes.
7.2 Preferred Creditors under Irish Law and Floating Charges
If the Issuer becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Issuer has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, the Noteholders (and other Secured Parties) may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company, such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) which have been approved by the relevant Irish courts. See 7.3 “Examinership”.
The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish tax resident company (which would include the Issuer) may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.
Where the holder of the security has given notice to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 calendar days of its creation or, where the fixed charge has been transferred, on or before 31 January 2020 or within 21 days of the date of transfer of the fixed charge (whichever is the later), the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.
In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company which are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.
The essence of a fixed charge is that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer any charge constituted by the Trust Deed and/or the Irish Security Agreement may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.
In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the monies standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.
Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security over the relevant charged assets would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.
Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:
(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;
(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up even if crystallised prior to the commencement of wind-up;
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and
(e) they rank after fixed charges.
7.3 Examinership
Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court under Section 509 of the Companies Act 2014.
The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.
During the period of protection (which is for an initial period of 70 days and may be extended to 100 days and further extended to 150 days at the discretion of the court), the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist in the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. The ability to extend the period of protection to 150 days is an interim measure introduced as a result of COVID-19, which will remain in force until 31 December 2020, although it may be further extended. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.
In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders. The fact that the Issuer is a special purpose vehicle and that all of its liabilities should be of a limited recourse nature means that it is unlikely that an examiner would be appointed to the Issuer.
However, if for any reason, an examiner were appointed while any amounts due by the Issuer under the Notes were unpaid, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed and/or the Irish Security Agreement;
(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and
(d) if a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.
7.4 Irish Taxation Position of the Issuer
Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Irish withholding tax if there is a change in Irish tax law or if the various exemption conditions set forth under the section of this Offering Circular titled “Tax Considerations – Irish Taxation – Taxation of Noteholders – Withholding Tax” are not fulfilled. The Issuer is not obligated to gross up or otherwise compensate Noteholders for withholding taxes incurred. This may, therefore, affect the return which Noteholders received on the Notes.
Changes in Irish tax laws may adversely impact the Issuer’s business and the value of the Noteholders’ investment.
The Issuer is treated as a securitisation vehicle which is taxed pursuant to Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (“TCA”). There is no guarantee that the tax treatment of an Irish securitisation company will not change in the future. The tax deductibility of the Issuer’s interest costs will depend on the applicability of Section 110 TCA and the current revenue practice in relation to that matter. If these rules change this may have an impact on the return for Noteholders.
Ireland’s Finance Act 2019 introduced some measures which may qualify the extent to which interest payable in respect of results-dependent securities (such as the Subordinated Notes) may be deducted for Irish tax purposes. The measures provide that in many cases interest paid to persons which both hold more than 20.0 per cent. of any results-dependent securities issued by the Issuer (or the interest payable in respect of them) and exercise “significant influence” over the Issuer may only be deducted for Irish tax purposes to the extent it is paid to a person that is resident in Ireland or is subject to tax in a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a jurisdiction with which Ireland has a double tax treaty. The term “significant influence” is defined as meaning an ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the Issuer. The changes to Ireland’s tax legislation came into force as of 1 January 2020. It remains to be seen how the measures will be applied in practice and, as a result, it is not clear who could be considered to exercise “significant influence” over the Issuer.
If the Irish tax authorities impose net income, profits or similar tax upon the Issuer or its representative of any amount in excess of €1,000 for the relevant year a Note Tax Event will occur. If Issuer was unable to cure such Note Tax Event the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
7.5 No Regulation of the Issuer any Irish Regulatory Authority
The Issuer is not required to be licensed or authorised under any current securities, commodities, insurance or banking laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. In particular, the Issuer is not and will not be licensed or authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland as a result of issuing the Notes. Any investment in the Notes does not have the status of a bank deposit and is not within the scope of the deposit protection scheme operated by the Central Bank of Ireland.

The holders of each Class of Notes are entitled to the benefit of, are bound by and are deemed to have notice of all the provisions of the Trust Deed, and are deemed to have notice of all the provisions of the Transaction Documents applicable to them.
The UK withdrew from and ceased to be a member state of the EU at 11:00 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. The negotiated withdrawal agreement entered into between the UK and the EU provides for a transition period, commencing on 31 January 2020 and ending at 11.00 p.m. GMT on 31 December 2020 (such period, the “Transition Period”). Unless otherwise provided in the negotiated withdrawal agreement, EU law will be applicable to and in the UK during the Transition Period.

The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Registrar shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to submit a written certification substantiating that it is a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. If such holder fails to submit any such requested written certification on a timely basis, the Issuer has the right to assume that the holder of the Notes from whom such a certification is requested is not a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. Furthermore, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse to honour a transfer of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Note to any Person who is not either a non-U.S. Person or a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP.
(i) Forced sale pursuant to FATCA
Each Noteholder (which, for the purposes of this Condition 2(i) (Forced sale pursuant to FATCA) may include a nominee or beneficial owner of a Note) will agree to provide the Issuer and its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer. In the event the Noteholder fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of the Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any taxes to which the Issuer is subject under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges, and any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Noteholder as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may assign each such Note, or procure that each such Note is assigned, a separate securities identifier in the Issuer’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would enable the Issuer to comply with FATCA.
(j) Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA
If any Noteholder is determined by the Issuer to be a Noteholder who has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction, Benefit Plan Investor, Controlling Person, Other Plan Law, Similar Law or other ERISA representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading, or whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in Title I of ERISA and the related U.S. Department of Labor regulations (any such Noteholder a “Non-Permitted ERISA Holder”), the Non-Permitted ERISA Holder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) within 10 days of receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Non-Permitted ERISA Holder requiring such sale or transfer at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of such Notes or an interest in such Notes, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer, to the extent required to effect such transfers. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer. The Non-Permitted ERISA Holder will receive the balance, if any.
(k) Forced Transfer Mechanics and Registrar Authorisation
In order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced sale pursuant to FATCA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA), the Issuer may repay any affected Notes at par value and issue replacement Notes and the Issuer shall work with the Clearing Systems to take such action as may be necessary to effect such repayment and issue of replacement Notes. The Noteholders hereby authorise the Issuer and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced sale pursuant to FATCA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder. The Noteholders shall be bound by any actions taken by the Issuer, the Clearing Systems or any other party taken pursuant to the above-named Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer.
(l) Contributions
At any time during or after the Reinvestment Period, any Noteholder may make a contribution of cash (a “Contribution” and each such Noteholder, a “Contributor”). The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may accept or reject any Contribution in its reasonable discretion and will notify the Collateral
Administrator of any such acceptance. If a Contribution is accepted, it will be received into the Contribution Account and applied towards a Permitted Use by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer as directed by the Contributor at the time such Contribution is made (or, if no direction is given by the Contributor, at the Collateral Manager’s reasonable discretion) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(xi) (Contribution Account). No Contribution or portion thereof will be returned to the Contributor at any time. The acceptance of Contributions shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) Contributions from Contributors shall be a minimum of EUR 1,000,000 in aggregate; and
(ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will be satisfied immediately after a Contribution has been received.
(m) Exchange of Voting/Non-Voting Notes
Each of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes may be in the form of a CM Voting Note, a CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Note or a CM Non-Voting Note.
CM Voting Notes shall carry a right to vote in respect of, and be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Replacement Resolution and any CM Removal Resolution. CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and CM Non-Voting Notes shall not carry any rights in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution but shall carry a right to vote on and be counted in respect of all other matters in respect of which the CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted.
CM Voting Notes shall be exchangeable at any time upon request by the relevant Noteholder into CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes. CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes shall be exchangeable (a) upon request by the relevant Noteholder at any time into CM Non-Voting Notes or
(b) into CM Voting Notes only in connection with the transfer of such Notes to an entity that is not an Affiliate of the transferor upon request of the relevant transferee or transferor and in no other circumstance. CM Non-Voting Notes shall not be exchangeable at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
Any such right to exchange a Note, as described and subject to the limitations set out in the immediately prior paragraph, may be exercised by a Noteholder holding a Definitive Certificate or a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate delivering to the Registrar or a Transfer Agent a duly completed exchange request substantially in the form provided in the Trust Deed.
(n) Acquisitions of Subordinated Notes
Any purchaser of Subordinated Notes must: (i) provide the Issuer with a duly completed Relevant Declaration; and (ii) in the case of a purchaser which acquires Subordinated Notes as a result of a transfer happening after the Issue Date, confirm to the Issuer that it is not a ‘specified person’ within the meaning of section 110 TCA, in each case, prior to such purchase.

Where the payment of any amount in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out above is subject to any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax or any other tax is payable by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of any such amount, payment of the amount so deducted or withheld or of the tax so due shall be made to the relevant taxing authority pari passu with and, so far as possible, at the same time as the payment of the amount in respect of which the relevant deduction or withholding or other liability to tax has arisen.
(iii) Reinvestment Amounts – Requests to Reinvest
(A) Any Subordinated Noteholder may deliver a written notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager (a “Reinvestment Request”) proposing to designate as a contribution to the Issuer all or a specified portion of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be distributed on a Payment Date to such holder pursuant to paragraph (DD)(2)(b) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments or paragraph (T)(2)(b) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. A Reinvestment Request must be received by the Issuer and the Collateral Manager no later than seven Business Days prior to a Payment Date and any Reinvestment Request received after such date shall be deemed null and void.
(B) The Collateral Manager shall, in consultation with such Subordinated Noteholder (but in the Collateral Manager’s sole and absolute discretion), determine (which determination will not be called into question as a result of subsequent events) whether to accept or reject a Reinvestment Request and shall notify the relevant Subordinated Noteholder within two Business Days of receiving the Reinvestment Request (or such longer notice period as may be agreed by the relevant Subordinated Noteholder and the Collateral Manager), and in any event, subject to Condition 3(c)(iii)(E)(5) (Reinvestment Amounts – Requests to Reinvest), no later than five Business Days prior to a Payment Date) whether a Reinvestment Request has been accepted or rejected.
(C) If a Reinvestment Request has been accepted by the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager shall promptly (and in any event, no later than five Business Days prior to a Payment Date) deliver a Reinvestment Instruction to the Collateral Administrator. The Reinvestment Instruction shall (i) confirm that such Reinvestment Request has been accepted by the Collateral Manager, (ii) specify the portion of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that is not to be distributed to the relevant Subordinated Noteholder on the upcoming Payment Date and which is instead to constitute a Reinvestment Amount; and (iii) instruct the Collateral Administrator to procure that any such Reinvestment Amount is not distributed on the upcoming Payment Date and is instead deposited on such Payment Date to the Principal Account.
(D) The Collateral Manager must utilise Reinvestment Amounts for a Permitted Use (as determined by the Collateral Manager). Any Reinvestment Amount shall be treated as an outstanding debt owed by the Issuer to a Reinvesting Noteholder but shall not earn interest and shall not increase the Principal Amount Outstanding or accrued interest of the Subordinated Notes held by such holder and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be an alternative debt to (and not in addition to) any claim to Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise have been distributed to such Reinvesting Noteholder on the relevant Payment Date.
(E) In connection with the foregoing:
(1) each Reinvestment Request and Reinvestment Instruction shall be irrevocable;
(2) each Subordinated Noteholder by purchasing and holding the Subordinated Notes acknowledges and agrees that it may only issue a Reinvestment Request while the Subordinated Notes are held as Definitive Certificates;
(3) none of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other Agent shall be required to keep a record of the outstanding Reinvestment Amounts from time to time, such duty being the responsibility of the Collateral Manager (and such parties shall be entitled to rely on the records of the Collateral Manager accordingly);
(4) none of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other Agent shall have any responsibility to determine or monitor whether a Reinvestment Amount is utilized for a Permitted Use;
(5) the Collateral Administrator shall have no liability where it refrains from accepting or acting upon a Reinvestment Instruction delivered to it later than five Business Days prior to a Payment Date but shall use reasonable endeavours to consider whether such Reinvestment Instruction can be accepted in the remaining timeframe prior to the Payment Date and, where the Collateral Administrator refrains from accepting a Reinvestment Instruction, it shall be the responsibility of the Collateral Manager to inform the Subordinated Noteholder that it failed to provide the Reinvestment Instruction by the relevant time and that the Reinvestment Request is therefore unable to proceed; and
(6) each of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and any other Agent shall be entitled, without liability, to rely on any determination, notice, instruction or request made or given by the Collateral Manager in connection with a Reinvestment Request, a Reinvestment Instruction or a Reinvestment Amount without enquiry.
(iv) Reinvestment Amounts – Payment
(A) In the absence of notice being given by a Reinvesting Noteholder in accordance with this Condition, no Reinvestment Amounts shall be repaid by the Issuer until the Maturity Date or upon an acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), in each case, in accordance with the relevant Priority of Payments.
(B) A Reinvesting Noteholder may deliver written notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager (a “Reinvestment Amount Payment Request”) requesting that some or all of any outstanding Reinvestment Amounts are paid to the relevant Reinvesting Noteholder on the next Payment Date in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. A Reinvestment Amount Payment Request must be received by the Issuer and the Collateral Manager no later than six Business Days prior to a Payment Date and any Reinvestment Amount Payment Request received after such date shall be deemed null and void.
(C) If a Reinvestment Amount Payment Request has been accepted by the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager shall promptly (and in any event, no later than five Business Days prior to a Payment Date) deliver a Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction to the Collateral Administrator. Such notice shall (i) confirm that such Reinvestment Amount Payment Request has been accepted by the Collateral Manager (ii) specify the amount to be distributed to a Reinvesting Noteholder; (iii) specify the relevant contact details, account information and any other information required by the Collateral Administrator to process such payment; and (iv) constitute an instruction to the Collateral Administrator from the Collateral Manager accordingly.
(D) In connection with the foregoing
(1) each Reinvestment Amount Payment Request and Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction shall be irrevocable;
(2) none of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other Agent shall be required to keep a record of the outstanding Reinvestment Amounts from time to time following repayment or partial repayment of a Reinvestment Amount, such duty being the responsibility of the Collateral Manager (and such parties shall be entitled to rely on the records of the Collateral Manager accordingly);
(3) the Collateral Administrator shall have no liability where it refrains from accepting or acting upon a Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction delivered to it later than five Business Days prior to a Payment Date but shall use reasonable endeavours to consider whether such Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction can be accepted in the remaining timeframe prior to the Payment Date and, where the Collateral Administrator refrains from accepting a Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction, it shall be the responsibility of the Collateral Manager to inform the Subordinated Noteholder that it failed to provide the Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction by the relevant time and that the Reinvestment Amount Payment Request is therefore unable to proceed; and
(4) each of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and any other Agent shall be entitled, without liability, to rely on any determination, notice, instruction or request made or given by the Collateral Manager in connection with a Reinvestment Amount Payment Request, a Reinvestment Amount Payment Instruction or a Reinvestment Amount without enquiry.
(d) Non-payment of Amounts
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes, pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payment by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not be an Event of Default unless and until such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days (or ten Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission), save in each case as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon as set forth in Condition 9 (Taxation). Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds shall not at any time constitute an Event of Default.
Subject always, in the case of Interest Amounts payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes to Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) and save as otherwise provided in respect of any unpaid Collateral Management Fees (and VAT payable in respect thereof) or Reinvestment Amounts to Reinvesting Noteholders, if non-payment of any amounts referred to in the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments or the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments occurs on any Payment Date, such amounts shall remain due and shall be payable on each subsequent Payment Date in the orders of priority provided for in this Condition 3 (Status). References to the amounts referred to in the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments of this Condition 3 (Status) shall include any amounts thereof not paid when due in accordance with this Condition 3 (Status) on any preceding Payment Date.
(e) Determination and Payment of Amounts
The Collateral Administrator will, in consultation with the Collateral Manager, as of each Determination Date, calculate the amounts payable on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment and will notify the Issuer and the Trustee of such amounts. The Account Bank (acting in accordance with the instructions of the Collateral Administrator who is acting in accordance with the Payment Date Report compiled by the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer), shall, on behalf of the Issuer not later than 12.00 noon (London time) on the Business Day preceding each Payment Date, cause the amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account, the Unused Proceeds Account and if applicable the Interest Account and the Collateral Enhancement Account (together with, to the extent applicable, amounts standing to the credit of any other Account) to the extent required to pay the amounts referred to in the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments which are payable on such Payment Date, to be transferred to the Payment Account in accordance with Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts).

(i) account to the Trustee for or otherwise apply all sums received in respect of such Trust Collateral as the Trustee may direct (provided that, subject to these Conditions and the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall be entitled to apply the benefit of such Trust Collateral and such sums in respect of such Trust Collateral received by it and held on trust under this paragraph without prior direction from the Trustee);
(ii) exercise any rights it may have in respect of the Trust Collateral at the direction of the Trustee; and
(iii) at its own cost take such action and execute such documents as the Trustee may in its sole discretion require.
The Issuer may from time to time grant security (to the extent required):
(i) by way of a first priority security interest to a Hedge Counterparty over a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral deposited by such Hedge Counterparty in the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account as security for the Issuer’s obligations to repay or redeem such Counterparty Downgrade Collateral pursuant to the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement and these Conditions (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between such third party, the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and the Trustee (to the extent the Trustee is a party to the relevant security document and for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may grant such security interest directly to the Hedge Counterparty)); and/or
(ii) by way of first priority security interest over amounts representing all or part of the Unfunded Amount of any Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and deposited in its name with a third party as security for any payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation including but not limited to reimbursement or indemnification obligation of the Issuer owed to any other lender under such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, subject to the terms of Condition 3(j)(vii) (The Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account),
excluding for the purposes of (i) and (ii) (inclusive) above, (A) the Irish Excluded Assets and (B) any and all rights and assets of the Issuer that are the subject of a security interest pursuant to the Irish Security Agreement.
All deeds, documents, assignments, instruments, bonds, notes, negotiable instruments, papers and any other instruments comprising, evidencing, representing and/or transferring the Portfolio will be deposited with or held by or on behalf of the Custodian until the security over such obligations is irrevocably discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement. If the ratings of the Custodian are downgraded to below the Rating Requirement or withdrawn, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that a replacement Custodian with the Rating Requirement is appointed in accordance with and on substantially the same terms as the Agency Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement, the Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction in value of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure the Collateral and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held in a clearing system or in safe custody by the Custodian, a bank or other custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for ensuring that the Custodian, the Account Bank or any Hedge Counterparty satisfies the Rating Requirement applicable to it or, if it fails to satisfy such Rating Requirement, to procure the appointment of a replacement custodian, account bank or hedge counterparty. The Trustee has no responsibility for
the management of the Portfolio by the Collateral Manager or to supervise the administration of the Portfolio by the Collateral Administrator or the performance of the functions of the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator or by any other party and is entitled to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without enquiry or liability. The Trust Deed also provides that the Trustee shall accept without investigation, requisition or objection such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
Pursuant to the Irish Security Agreement, the Issuer shall, on or around the Issue Date, create in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of itself and the other Secured Parties, an Irish law first fixed charge and first floating charge over the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts).
(b) Application of Proceeds upon Enforcement
The Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement provide that the net proceeds of realisation of, or enforcement with respect to the security over, the Collateral constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the priorities of payment set out in Condition 11 (Enforcement).
(c) Limited Recourse and Non-Petition
The obligations of the Issuer to pay amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties at any time shall be limited to the proceeds available at such time to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Conditions or any Transaction Documents, if the net proceeds of realisation of the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement, upon enforcement thereof in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement are less than the aggregate amount payable in such circumstances by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties (such negative amount being referred to herein as a “shortfall”), the claims, obligations, debts and liabilities of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of each Class and its claims, obligations, debts and liabilities to the other Secured Parties in such circumstances will be limited to such net proceeds, which shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In such circumstances, the other assets (including the Irish Excluded Assets) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall which shall be borne by the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Subordinated Noteholders, the Reinvesting Noteholders (if any) and the other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (applied in reverse order). The rights of the Secured Parties (including the Noteholders) to receive any further amounts in respect of such claims, obligations, debts and liabilities shall be extinguished and none of the Noteholders of each Class or the other Secured Parties may take any further action to recover such amounts. None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee or the other Secured Parties (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, examinership, winding up, restructuring plan or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed, the Irish Security Agreement or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration or judgement as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
In addition, none of the Noteholders or any of the other Secured Parties shall have any recourse against any director, shareholder or officer of the Issuer in respect of any obligations, covenants or agreement entered into or made by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Conditions of the Notes or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party or any notice or documents which it is requested to deliver hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Trustee, the Directors, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Corporate Services Provider nor any Agent has any obligation to any Noteholder of any Class for payment of any amount by the Issuer in respect of the Notes of any Class.
(d) Acquisition and Sale of Portfolio
The Collateral Manager is required to manage the Portfolio and to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the parameters set out in, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and subject to the overall supervision and control of the Issuer. The duties of the Collateral Manager with respect to the Portfolio include (amongst others) the use of reasonable endeavours to:
(i) purchase Collateral Obligations on or prior to the Issue Date and during the Initial Investment Period;
(ii) invest the amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account, the relevant Hedge Termination Account, the relevant Asset Swap Account, the Payment Account, the Collection Account and any Swap Tax Credits standing to the credit of the Interest Account) in Eligible Investments; and
(iii) sell certain of the Collateral Obligations and reinvest the Principal Proceeds received in Substitute Collateral Obligations in accordance with the criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager is required to monitor the Collateral Obligations with a view to seeking to determine whether any Collateral Obligation has converted into, or been exchanged for, an Exchanged Equity Security or Defaulted Obligation, provided that, if it fails to do so, it will not have any liability to the Issuer except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (where gross negligence shall be given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of its obligations. No Noteholder shall have any recourse against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Trustee for any loss suffered as a result of such failure.
Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Retention Holder, the holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Controlling Class have certain rights in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and appointment of a replacement Collateral Manager.
(e) Exercise of Rights in Respect of the Portfolio
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer authorises the Collateral Manager, prior to enforcement of the security over the Collateral, to exercise all rights and remedies of the Issuer in its capacity as a holder of, or person beneficially entitled to, the Portfolio. In particular, the Collateral Manager is authorised, subject to any specific direction given by the Issuer, to attend and vote at any meeting of holders of, or other persons interested or participating in, or entitled to the rights or benefits (or a part thereof) under, the Portfolio and to give any consent, waiver, indulgence, time or notification, make any declaration or agree any composition, compounding or other similar arrangement with respect to any obligations forming part of the Portfolio.
(f) Information Regarding the Collateral
The Issuer shall procure that a copy of each Monthly Report and any Payment Date Report is made available, in pdf format, with the underlying portfolio data being made available in Excel or CSV format, via the Reporting Website, which shall be accessible to any Relevant Recipient. It is not intended that such Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports will be made available in any other format, save in limited circumstances with the Collateral Administrator’s agreement. The Collateral Administrator’s website does not form part of the information provided for the purposes of the offering circular relating to the Notes and disclaimers may be posted with respect to the information posted thereon.
(g) Securitisation Regulation
The Issuer hereby agrees to be designated as the entity required to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer will assume all costs of complying with the EU Transparency Requirements (including the properly incurred costs and expenses (including legal fees) of all parties incurred amending the Transaction Documents for this purpose) and, if applicable, shall reimburse each of the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Administrator for any such costs incurred by the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator in connection with their assisting the Issuer with the preparation and/or filing of such information and reports required pursuant to the provisions of
the Securitisation Regulation and the Irish STS Regulations, such costs to be paid as Administrative Expenses.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Administrator shall not assume any statutory responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents. Any such reports may refer to disclaimers excluding liability of the Collateral Administrator for the information provided therein.
5. Covenants of and Restrictions on the Issuer
(a) Covenants of the Issuer

If, however, it is unable to do so, having used such endeavours, or if the maintenance of such listings are agreed by the Trustee to be unduly onerous and the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the holders of the Outstanding Notes of each Class would not thereby be materially prejudiced, the Issuer will instead use all reasonable endeavours promptly to obtain and thereafter to maintain a listing for such Notes on such other stock exchange(s) as it may (with the approval of the Trustee) decide, provided that such other stock exchange is a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA and Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

(D) it shall not open any office or branch or place of business outside of Ireland;
(E) it shall not knowingly take any action (save to the extent necessary for the Issuer to comply with its obligations under the Transaction Documents) which will cause its “centre of main interests” (within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation) to be located in any jurisdiction other than Ireland and will not establish any offices, branches or other establishments (as defined in the Insolvency Regulation) or register as a company in any jurisdiction other than Ireland; and

(b) Restrictions on the Issuer
For so long as any of the Notes remain Outstanding, save as contemplated in the Transaction Documents, the Issuer covenants to the holders of such Outstanding Notes that (to the extent applicable) it will not, without the prior written consent of the Trustee (and in the case of paragraph (vi) below only, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s):
(i) sell, factor, discount, transfer, assign, lend or otherwise dispose of any of its right, title or interest in or to the Collateral, other than in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, nor will it create or permit to be outstanding any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge,
encumbrance or other security interest over the Collateral except in accordance with the Trust Deed, the Conditions of the Notes or the Transaction Documents;
(ii) sell, factor, discount, transfer, assign, lend or otherwise dispose of, nor create or permit to be outstanding any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, encumbrance or other security interest over, any of its other property or assets or any part thereof or interest therein other than in accordance with the Trust Deed, a Hedge Agreement, the Conditions of the Notes or the Transaction Documents;
(iii) engage in any business other than the holding or managing or both the holding and managing, in each case in Ireland, of “qualifying assets” within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA and in connection therewith shall not engage in any business other than:
(A) acquiring and holding any property, assets or rights that are capable of being effectively secured in favour of the Trustee or that are capable of being held on trust by the Issuer in favour of the Trustee under the Trust Deed or the Irish Security Agreement;
(B) issuing and performing its obligations under the Notes;
(C) entering into, exercising its rights and performing its obligations under or enforcing its rights under the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, as applicable; or

(A) the Notes (including the issuance of additional Notes pursuant to Condition 17 (Additional Issuances)) or any document entered into in connection with the Notes or the sale thereof or any additional Notes or the sale thereof;

(xi) convey or transfer all or a substantial part of its properties or assets (in one or a series of transactions) to any person, otherwise than as contemplated in these Conditions;

(xiii) enter into any material agreement or contract with any Person (other than an agreement on customary market terms which for the avoidance of doubt will include agreements to buy and sell obligations and documentation relating to restructurings (including steering committee indemnity letters), which terms do not contain the provisions below) unless such contract or agreement contains “limited recourse” and “non-petition” provisions and such Person agrees that, prior to the date that is after all the related obligations of the Issuer have been paid in full (or, if longer, the applicable preference
period under applicable insolvency law), such Person shall not take any action or institute any proceeding against the Issuer under any insolvency law applicable to the Issuer or which would reasonably be likely to cause the Issuer to be subject to or seek protection of, any such insolvency law; provided that such Person shall be permitted to become a party to and to participate in any proceeding or action under any such insolvency law that is initiated by any other Person other than one of its Affiliates;

6. Interest

(a) Payment Dates
(i) Rated Notes
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes each bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable:
(A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling on 15 July 2021;
(B) in respect of each 6 month Accrual Period, semi-annually; and
(C) in respect of each 3 month Accrual Period, quarterly, in each case in arrear on such Payment Date.
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Interest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes to the extent funds are available in accordance with paragraph (DD) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph (T) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (AA) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments on each Payment Date and shall continue to be payable in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) notwithstanding redemption in full of any Subordinated Note at its applicable Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the Trust Deed, all references herein and therein to the Subordinated Notes being redeemed in full or at their Principal Amount Outstanding shall be deemed to be amended to the extent required to ensure that a minimum of €1 principal amount of each such Class of Notes remains Outstanding at all times and any amounts which are to be applied in redemption of each such Class of Notes pursuant hereto which are in excess of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof minus €1, shall constitute interest payable in respect of such Notes and shall not be applied in redemption of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof, provided always however that such €1 principal shall no longer remain Outstanding and each such Class of Notes shall be redeemed in full on the date on which all of the Collateral securing the Notes has been realised and is to be finally distributed to the Noteholders.
If the aggregate of income and gains earned by the Issuer during an accounting period exceeds the costs and expenses accrued for that period, such excess shall accrue as additional interest on the Subordinated Notes but shall only be payable on any Payment Date following payment in full of amounts payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payment on such Payment Date.
(b) Interest Accrual
(i) Rated Notes
Each Rated Note (or, as the case may be, the relevant part thereof due to be redeemed) will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, it shall continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of:
(A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder; and
(B) the day following seven calendar days after the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent has notified the Noteholders of such Class of Notes in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes of such Class up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Payments on the Subordinated Notes will cease to be payable in respect of each Subordinated Note upon the date that all of the Collateral has been realised and no Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral remain available for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(c) Deferral of Interest
(i) Deferred Interest
The Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes in full on any Payment Date, in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount which would, but for the first paragraph of this Condition 6(c)(i) (Deferred Interest) otherwise be due and payable in respect of such Class of Notes on any Payment Date (each such amount being referred to as “Deferred Interest”) will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class of Notes, and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will not be an Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Notes are to be repaid or redeemed in full. Interest will cease to accrue on each Note, or in the case of a partial repayment, on such part, from the date of repayment or the Maturity Date or early redemption date unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or unless default is otherwise made with respect to such payment of principal.
(ii) Non-payment of Interest
Non-payment of interest on the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes, subject to Condition 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest), shall constitute an Event of Default following the expiry of the five Business Days grace period (or ten Business Days due to an administrative error or omission) in accordance with Condition 10 (Events of Default).
(d) Payment of Deferred Interest
Deferred Interest in respect of any Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note shall only become payable by the Issuer in accordance with respectively, paragraphs (K), (N), (Q) and (T) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraphs (D), (G), (J) and (M) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraphs (K), (N), (Q) and (T) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and under the Note Payment Sequence in each place specified in the Priorities of Payment, to the extent that Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, as applicable, are available to make such payment in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (and, if applicable, the Note Payment Sequence). For the avoidance of doubt, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes, as applicable will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes. An amount equal to any such Deferred Interest so paid shall be subtracted from the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes as applicable.
(e) Interest on the Rated Notes
(i) Floating Rate of Interest
The rate of interest from time to time in respect of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Floating Rate of Interest), in respect of the Class B-1 Notes (the “Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class C Notes (the “Class C Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class D Notes (the “Class D Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class E Notes (the “Class E Floating Rate of Interest”) in respect of the Class F Notes (the “Class F Floating Rate of Interest”) (and each, a “Floating Rate of Interest”) will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:
(A) On each Interest Determination Date:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, the Calculation Agent will determine a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for 6 and 12 month EURIBOR;
(2) in the case of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for 3 month EURIBOR; and
(3) (i) in the case of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for 6 month EURIBOR, or (ii) in the case of the Accrual Period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls on or about 15 October 2033, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for 3 month EURIBOR,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. Such offered rate will be that which appears on the display designated on the Bloomberg Screen “BTMM EU” Page (or such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying EURIBOR rates). The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (as defined below) in respect of (i) the initial Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (1) above; and (ii) each six month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (3)(i) above; and (iii) each three month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (2) or (3)(ii) above (as applicable), in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(B) If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then paragraph (A) shall be applied, with any necessary consequential changes, to the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not so appear, or if the relevant page is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of four major banks in the Euro zone interbank market (selected by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager
on behalf of the Issuer subject to this Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest)) acting in each case through its principal Euro zone office (the “Reference Banks”) to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for 6 and 12 month EURIBOR;
(2) in respect of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of 3 months; and
(3) (i) in respect of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of 6 months or, (ii) in the case of the Accrual Period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls on 15 October 2033, for a period of 3 months,
in each case as at 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (if any) and the arithmetic mean, in each case, (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of, in respect of (i) the initial Accrual Period; the quotations referred to in paragraph (1) above; and (ii) each 6 month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (3)(i) above; and
(iii) each 3 month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (2) or (3))(ii) above (as applicable) (or of such quotations, being at least two, as are so provided), all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(C) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides such quotation, the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, respectively, for the next Accrual Period shall be the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, in each case in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period; provided that following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event in respect of the Accrual Period ending on the Maturity Date if such Accrual Period is a three month period, the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, respectively, shall be determined by reference to the most recent offered rate for three month Euro deposits obtainable by the Calculation Agent.
(D) Where:
“Applicable Margin” means:
(1) in the case of the Class A Notes: 1.15 per cent. per annum;
(2) in the case of the Class B-1 Notes: 2.15 per cent. per annum;
(3) in the case of the Class C Notes 2.70 per cent. per annum;
(4) in the case of the Class D Notes: 3.85 per cent. per annum;
(5) in the case of the Class E Notes: 6.70 per cent. per annum; and
(6) in the case of the Class F Notes: 8.14 per cent. per annum.
(E) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B) above, if, in relation to any Interest Determination Date, EURIBOR in respect of any Rated Notes as determined in accordance with paragraphs
(A) and (B) above would yield a rate less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of determining the Floating Rate of Interest pursuant to this Condition 6(e)(i)) (Floating Rate of Interest).
(ii) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Interest Determination Date, but in no event later than the Business Day after such date, determine the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest and calculate the interest amount payable in respect of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes for the relevant Accrual Period. The amount of interest (the “Interest Amount”) payable shall be calculated by applying the Class A Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class B-1 Notes, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class D Notes, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class E Notes and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest in the Class F Notes, respectively, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned, divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
Where Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest) applies, any test or calculation required to be made in accordance with the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document: (i) where such test or calculation requires a determination of a Floating Rate of Interest, and (ii) the date of such test or calculation falls in between two Interest Determination Dates, the applicable offered rate shall be the offered rate which was applicable as of the previous Interest Determination Date.
(iii) Reference Banks and Calculation Agent
The Issuer will procure that, so long as any Class A Note, Class B-1 Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note remains Outstanding:
(A) a Calculation Agent shall be appointed and maintained for the purposes of determining the interest rate and interest amount payable in respect of the Notes; and
(B) if the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest are to be calculated by Reference Banks pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), that the number of Reference Banks required pursuant to such Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest) are appointed by the Issuer and that the Calculation Agent has been provided with contact details for each such Reference Bank.
If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the purpose of calculating interest hereunder or fails duly to establish any Floating Rate of Interest for any Accrual Period, or to calculate the Interest Amount on any Class of Rated Notes, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the Trustee) appoint some other leading bank to act as such in its place. The resignation of the Calculation Agent shall not be effective until such time as a successor has been appointed.
(f) Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 am (Brussels time) on each Interest Determination Date, but in no event later than the Business Day after such date, calculate the amount of interest (an “Interest Amount”) payable in respect of the Class B-2 Notes for the relevant Accrual Period by applying the Class B-2 Fixed Rate, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned (the number of
days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 months of 30 days each) divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards) where:
“Class B-2 Fixed Rate” means 2.30 per cent. per annum.
(g) Proceeds in respect of Subordinated Notes
Solely in respect of Subordinated Notes, the Collateral Administrator will on each Determination Date calculate the Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds payable to the extent of available funds for the relevant Accrual Period considering the amount of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds to be applied on the Subordinated Notes on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to the relevant Priorities of Payment.
(h) Publication of Floating Rates of Interest, Interest Amounts and Deferred Interest
The Calculation Agent will, at the cost of the Issuer (such cost being an Administrative Expense), cause the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest and the Interest Amounts payable in respect of each Class of Rated Notes, the amount of any Deferred Interest due but not paid on any Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes for each Accrual Period and Payment Date, the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event on any Frequency Switch Measurement Date, and the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes as of the applicable Payment Date to be notified to the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, Euronext Dublin as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter, and the Principal Paying Agent shall cause each such rate, amount and date to be notified to the Noteholders of each Class in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible following notification to the Principal Paying Agent but in no event later than the third Business Day after such notification. The Interest Amounts in respect of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes or the Payment Date in respect of any Class of Notes so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made with the consent of the Trustee by way of adjustment) without notice if an extension or shortening of the Accrual Period occurs. If the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10 (Events of Default), interest shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) but no publication of the applicable Interest Amounts shall be made unless the Trustee so determines.
(i) Notifications, etc. to be Final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Calculation Agent, will (in the absence of manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and all Noteholders and (in the absence of the negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud of the Reference Banks or the Calculation Agent, as applicable) no liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders of any Class shall attach to the Reference Banks or the Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise or delay in exercising by them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 6(i) (Notifications, etc. to be Final).
7. Redemption and Purchase

(a) Final Redemption
Save to the extent previously redeemed in full and cancelled, the Notes of each Class will be redeemed on the Maturity Date of such Notes. In the case of a redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption), the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes will be redeemed at their Redemption Price in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence and the Subordinated Notes will be redeemed at the amount equal to their share of the amounts of Principal Proceeds to be applied towards such redemption pursuant to paragraph (Q) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Notes may not be redeemed other than in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

Subject to the provisions of Condition 7(b)(iv) (Terms and Conditions of an Optional Redemption), and Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing), the Rated Notes of any Class may be redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable Redemption Prices, from Refinancing Proceeds (in accordance with Condition 7(b)(v) below) ((Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing)) on any Business Day falling on or after expiry of the Non- Call Period at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices) subject to the consent of the Collateral Manager.
No such Optional Redemption may occur unless any Class of Rated Notes to be redeemed represents the entire Class of such Rated Notes.
(iii) Optional Redemption in Whole – Collateral Manager Clean-up Call
Subject to the provisions of Condition 7(b)(iv) (Terms and Conditions of an Optional Redemption), and Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes effected through Liquidation only), the Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part by the Issuer, at the applicable Redemption Prices, from Sale Proceeds on any Payment Date falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period if, upon or at any time following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount and if directed in writing by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer).
(iv) Terms and Conditions of an Optional Redemption In connection with any Optional Redemption:
(A) the Issuer shall procure that at least 17 Business Days’ prior written notice of such Optional Redemption (which notice shall state that any Optional Redemption is subject to satisfaction of the conditions in this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption)), including the applicable Redemption Date, and the relevant Redemption Price therefor, is given to the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices);
(B) the Rated Notes to be redeemed shall be redeemed at their applicable Redemption Prices (subject, in the case of an Optional Redemption of the Rated Notes in whole, to the right of holders of 100 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of any Class of Rated Notes to elect to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to the holders of such Class of Rated Notes). Such right shall be exercised by delivery by each holder of the relevant Class of Rated Notes of a written direction confirming such
holder’s election to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price that would otherwise be payable to it, together with evidence of their holding to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager no later than 17 Business Days (or such shorter period of time as may be agreed by the Collateral Manager, acting reasonably) prior to the relevant Redemption Date (and for the avoidance of doubt the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on confirmation from the Issuer or the Collateral Manager that such election has been made without enquiry or liability);
(C) the Collateral Manager shall have no right or other ability to prevent an Optional Redemption directed by the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) other than as expressly contemplated in Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders);

(E) any redemption in part of the Notes pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part
– Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders) may be effected from Refinancing Proceeds in accordance with Condition 7(b)(v) below (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).
(v) Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing
Following either (A) receipt of, or as the case may be, confirmation from the Transfer Agent or Principal Paying Agent of receipt of a written direction from the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders); or (B) receipt of, or as the case may be, confirmation from the Transfer Agent or Principal Paying Agent of receipt of a written direction from the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders) along with the written consent of the Collateral Manager, the Issuer may:
(1) in the case of a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders):
(a) enter into a loan (as borrower thereunder) with one or more financial institutions; or
(b) issue replacement notes; and
(2) in the case of a redemption of an entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes (but not of all Classes of Rated Notes) in accordance with Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders) issue replacement notes (each, a “Refinancing Obligation”),
whose terms in each case will be negotiated by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer (any such refinancing, a “Refinancing”). Each Refinancing is required to satisfy the conditions described in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).
Refinancing Proceeds may be applied in addition to (or in place of) Sale Proceeds in the redemption of the Rated Notes in whole pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders). In addition, Refinancing Proceeds must be applied in the redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders). In connection with a Refinancing pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders), the Collateral Manager may designate Principal Proceeds as Interest Proceeds in an amount not to exceed the Excess Par Amount provided that (i) the Collateral Manager shall give notice to each Rating Agency of such designated amount; (ii) the Class B-1 Noteholders shall have provided their consent (acting by Extraordinary Resolution); and (iii) each of the Collateral Quality Tests is satisfied as of the date such Refinancing is completed.

In the case of a Refinancing in relation to the redemption of all of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders) as described above, such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to the Rating Agencies;
(2) all Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs, (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Trustee Fees and Expenses that are Refinancing Costs and any Administrative Expenses that are Refinancing Costs) and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes save for the Subordinated Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments;
(3) all Principal Proceeds, Refinancing Proceeds, Sale Proceeds, if any, and other available funds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(4) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed; and
(5) all Refinancing Proceeds and all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments, are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date,
in each case, as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without any liability or enquiry) by the Collateral Manager.
(B) Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Part
In the case of a Refinancing in relation to a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Refinancing of a Class or Classes of Notes in whole by Subordinated Noteholders), such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to the Rating Agencies;
(2) the Refinancing Obligations are in the form of notes;
(3) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption;
(4) the sum of (A) the Refinancing Proceeds and (B) the Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds will be at least sufficient to pay in full:
(a) the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption; plus

(b) all accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses in connection with such Refinancing;
(5) the Refinancing Proceeds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(6) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed;
(7) the Refinancing Proceeds and Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds are applied in accordance with the Partial Redemption Priority of Payments;
(8) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Obligations for each Class is equal to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds and the Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds;
(9) the maturity date of each class of Refinancing Obligation is the same as the Maturity Date of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds;
(10) the interest rate of any Refinancing Obligations will not be greater than the interest rate of the Rated Notes subject to such Optional Redemption;
(11) payments in respect of the Refinancing Obligations are subject to the Priorities of Payment and rank at the same priority pursuant to the Priorities of Payment as the relevant Class or Classes of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(12) the voting rights, consent rights, redemption rights (other than any modification to remove the right of the Subordinated Noteholders or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem by refinancing the Refinancing Obligations) and all other rights of the Refinancing Obligations are the same as the rights of the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the proportions of Refinancing Obligations issued in the form of “non-voting notes,” “non-voting exchangeable notes,” and “voting notes” in each case pursuant to these Conditions and the Trust Deed, may differ from the proportions of such types of Note applicable to the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(13) all Refinancing Proceeds are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and
(14) if the Partial Redemption Date is not otherwise a Payment Date, the Collateral Manager reasonably determines that Interest Proceeds will be available on the next following Payment Date in an amount at least equal to the sum of the amount that will be required for distribution under the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments for the payment of all Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses on the next following Payment Date;
(15) a Class of Fixed Rate Notes may not be refinanced into a Class of Floating Rate Notes; and
(16) a Class of Floating Rate Notes may not be refinanced into a Class of Fixed Rate Notes,
in each case, as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) by the Collateral Manager.
If, in relation to a proposed optional redemption of the Notes (whether in whole or in part, as applicable), any of the relevant conditions specified in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the relevant redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Any such cancellation shall not constitute an Event of Default.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee shall be liable to any party, including the Subordinated Noteholders, for any failure to obtain a Refinancing.
(C) Consequential Amendments
In connection with a Refinancing, the Trustee shall agree to the modification of the Trust Deed (including these Conditions) and the other Transaction Documents required by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf to the extent that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that such modification is necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing as approved by the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution)_(including any modification to remove the right of the Subordinated Noteholders or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem by refinancing the Refinancing Obligations), subject as provided below. No further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of Notes.
The Trustee will not be obliged to enter into any modification that, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the rights, powers, authorisations, discretions, indemnities and protections, of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents, and the Trustee will be entitled to conclusively rely without enquiry or liability upon an officer’s certificate and/or opinion of counsel as to matters of law (which may be supported as to factual (including financial and capital markets) matters by any relevant certificates and other documents necessary or advisable in the judgment of counsel delivering such opinion of counsel) provided by the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document to the effect that such amendment meets the requirements specified above and is permitted under the Trust Deed (including these Conditions) without the consent of the holders of the Notes (except that such officer or counsel will have no obligation to certify or opine as to the sufficiency of the Refinancing Proceeds).
(vi) Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes effected through Liquidation only
Following receipt of notice from the Issuer or, as the case may be, of confirmation from the Transfer Agent or Principal Paying Agent of:
(A) a direction in writing from the requisite percentage of Subordinated Noteholders (in the case of Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event));
(B) a direction in writing from the requisite percentage of the Controlling Class (in the case of Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event)); or
(C) a direction in writing from the Collateral Manager (in the case of a Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Collateral Manager Clean-up Call)),
as the case may be, to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Collateral, the Collateral Administrator shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 17 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date (the “Redemption Determination Date”), provided that the Collateral Administrator has received such notice or confirmation at least 20 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, calculate the Redemption Threshold Amount in consultation with the Collateral Manager.
The Notes shall not be optionally redeemed where such Optional Redemption is to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Portfolio unless:
(1) At least five Business Days before the scheduled Redemption Date the Collateral Manager shall have furnished to the Trustee a certificate (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) signed by an officer of the Collateral Manager that the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer has entered into a binding agreement or agreements with a financial or other institution or institutions which:
(a) either:
(i) has a long-term senior unsecured credit rating of at least “A2” by Moody’s or, if it does not have a Moody’s long-term senior unsecured credit rating, has a short- term senior unsecured rating of at least “P–1” by Moody’s,
(ii) in respect of which a Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s and KBRA Confirmation has been obtained (provided, for the purposes of this clause (ii), that a Rating Agency Confirmation cannot be deemed to not be required in these circumstances and must be provided as a positive confirmation))
(b) either:
(i) has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least “A” by S&P provided that it has a short-term issuer credit rating of at least “A-1” by S&P or, if it does not have such
a short-term issuer credit rating, a long-term issuer credit rating of at least “A+” by S&P; or
(ii) in respect of which Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P and KBRA Confirmation has been obtained,
to purchase (directly or by participation or other arrangement) from the Issuer, not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Redemption Date in immediately available funds, all or part of the Portfolio at a purchase price at least sufficient, together with the Eligible Investments maturing, redeemable or put-able to the issuer thereof at par on or prior to the scheduled Redemption Date and (without duplication) the amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts which would be applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments if the Notes fell due for redemption in full on such Redemption Date, to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount.
(2) (a) Prior to selling any Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments, the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that, in its judgment, the aggregate sum of:
(i) expected proceeds from the sale of Eligible Investments; and
(ii) for each Collateral Obligation, the product of its Principal Balance and its Market Value, and
(iii) (without duplication) amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts which would be applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments if the Notes fell due for redemption in full on such Redemption Date, and
shall be at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount; and
(b) no later than the Business Day before the scheduled Redemption Date, the Issuer shall have received proceeds of disposition of all or part of the Portfolio at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount.
(3) At least three Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) shall give notice to the Trustee in writing of the amount of all expenses that have been or will be incurred by the Issuer up to and including the scheduled Redemption Date in effecting such liquidation or realisation (to the extent such amounts are ascertainable by the Collateral Administrator or have been provided to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or any Secured Party).
(4) Any certification delivered by the Collateral Manager pursuant to this section must include:
(a) the prices of, and expected proceeds from, the sale (directly or by participation or other arrangement) of any Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments;
(b) details of the amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts that will be available to be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment; and
(c) all calculations required by this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) (as applicable).
Any Noteholder, the Collateral Manager or any of the Collateral Manager’s Affiliates shall have the right, subject to the same terms and conditions afforded to other bidders, to bid for Collateral Obligations to be sold as part of an Optional Redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes effected through Liquidation only).
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively and without enquiry or liability on any evidence, confirmation or certificate of, or formalised by, the Collateral Manager furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes effected through Liquidation only).
If either of the conditions (1) or (2) above is not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Such cancellation shall not constitute an Event of Default.
(vii) Mechanics of Redemption
Following calculation by the Collateral Administrator in consultation with the Collateral Manager of the relevant Redemption Threshold Amount, if applicable, the Collateral Administrator shall make such other calculations as it is required to make pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Registrar, whereupon the Registrar (using a notice prepared by the Issuer and at the cost of the Issuer) shall notify the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) of such amounts.
Any exercise of a right of Optional Redemption by the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or the Subordinated Noteholders or the Controlling Class pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) shall be effected by delivery to a Transfer Agent, by the requisite amount of Subordinated Noteholders or the requisite amount of Notes comprising the Controlling Class (as applicable) held thereby together with duly completed Redemption Notices not less than 17 Business Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. No Redemption Notice, Subordinated Note or Notes comprising the Controlling Class so delivered or any direction given by the Collateral Manager may be withdrawn without the prior consent of the Issuer. The Registrar shall copy each Redemption Notice or any direction given by the Collateral Manager received to each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and, if applicable, the Collateral Manager. Notwithstanding anything else in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), where a right of Optional Redemption is exercised by way of Ordinary Resolution or an Extraordinary Resolution of a meeting of the Subordinated Noteholders or the Controlling Class (as applicable), no separate Redemption Notice will be required to be issued in connection therewith and for the purposes of this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) any such resolutions shall be deemed to be Redemption Notices.
The Collateral Manager shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and the Principal Paying Agent in writing upon satisfaction of all of the conditions set out in this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and shall arrange for liquidation and/or realisation of the Portfolio in whole or in part as necessary, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Issuer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the funds required for an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) in the Payment Account on or before the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date or, in the case of a Refinancing, on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Principal Proceeds and Interest Proceeds received in connection with a redemption in whole of all the Rated Notes shall be payable in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments. Any redemption in whole of a Class of Rated Notes (other than a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes) shall be paid to the holders of such Class of Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(viii) Optional Redemption of Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part in aggregate at their Redemption Price on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of:
(A) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); or
(B) the Collateral Manager.
(c) Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests
(i) Class A Notes and Class B Notes
If the Class A/B Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on or after the Effective Date or if the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date or any Determination Date
thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Class A/B Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(ii) Class C Notes
If the Class C Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on or after the Effective Date or if the Class C Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Class C Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(iii) Class D Notes
If the Class D Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on or after the Effective Date or if the Class D Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Class D Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.

(d) Special Redemption
Principal payments on the Notes shall be made in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments at the sole and absolute discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) if, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) certifies to (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) the Trustee that using reasonable endeavours it has been unable, for a period of 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its discretion which meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account that are to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations (a “Special Redemption”). On the first Payment Date following the Due Period in which such certification is given (a “Special Redemption Date”), the funds in the Principal Account representing Principal Proceeds which, using reasonable endeavours, cannot be reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations (the “Special Redemption Amount”) will be applied in accordance with paragraph (O) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Notice of payments pursuant to this Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption) shall be given by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) not less than three Business Days prior to the applicable Special Redemption Date to each Noteholder and to each Rating Agency. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of a Special Redemption shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Collateral Manager shall be under no obligation to, or have any responsibility to, any Noteholder or any other person for the exercise or non- exercise (as applicable) of such Special Redemption.
(e) Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event
If as at the Business Day prior to the Payment Date following the Effective Date, an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, in each case, until redeemed in full or, if earlier, until an Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing.
(f) Redemption Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period
Following expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Issuer shall, on each Payment Date occurring thereafter, apply Principal Proceeds transferred to the Payment Account immediately prior to the related Payment Date in redemption of the Notes at their applicable Redemption Prices in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(g) Redemption following Note Tax Event
If a Note Tax Event occurs, the Issuer shall, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to cure that Note Tax Event (which may include changing the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would not give rise to a Note Tax Event). Upon the earlier of:
(i) the date upon which the Issuer certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) to the Trustee and the Noteholders that it is not able to cure the Note Tax Event; and
(ii) the date which is 90 calendar days from the date upon which the Issuer first becomes aware of such Note Tax Event (provided that such 90 calendar day period shall be extended by a further 90 calendar days if during the former period the Issuer has notified (or procured the notification of) the Trustee and the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) that, based on advice received by it, it expects that it shall have cured the Note Tax Event by the end of the latter 90 calendar day period),
the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, may elect that the Notes of each Class are redeemed, in whole but not in part, on any Payment Date thereafter, at their respective Redemption Prices in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in which case the Issuer shall so redeem the Notes on such terms, provided that such Note Tax Event would affect payment of principal or interest in respect of the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, the Subordinated Notes (in addition to any other Class of Notes) on such Payment Date; provided further that such redemption of the Notes, whether pursuant to the exercise of such option by the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, shall take place in accordance with the procedures set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
(h) Redemption
Unless otherwise specified in this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), all Notes in respect of which any notice of redemption is given shall be redeemed on the Redemption Date at their applicable Redemption Prices and to the extent specified in such notice and in accordance with the requirements of this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(i) Cancellation and Purchase
All Notes redeemed in full by the Issuer will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.
No Note may be surrendered (including in connection with any abandonment, donation, gift, contribution or other event or circumstance) except for payment as provided herein for cancellation pursuant to Condition 7(k) (Purchase) below, for registration of transfer, exchange or redemption, or for replacement in connection with any Note mutilated, defaced or deemed lost or stolen.
(j) Notice of Redemption
The Issuer shall procure that notice of any redemption in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) (which notice shall be irrevocable) is given to the Trustee and Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and each Hedge Counterparty and promptly in writing to the Rating Agencies.
(k) Purchase
On any Payment Date, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement the Issuer may, subject to the conditions below, purchase any of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part), using Principal Proceeds standing to the credit of the Principal Account or the Collateral Enhancement Account.
No purchase of Rated Notes by the Issuer may occur unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur in the following sequential order of priority: first, the Class A Notes on a pro rata basis, until the Class A Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; second, the Class B Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis, until the Class B Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; third, the Class C Notes on a pro rata basis, until the Class C Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; fourth, the Class D Notes on a pro rata basis, until the Class D Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; fifth, the Class E Notes on a pro rata basis, until the Class E Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; and sixth, the Class F Notes on a pro rata basis, until the Class F Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled;
(ii) each such purchase of Rated Notes of any Class shall be made pursuant to an offer made to all holders of the Rated Notes of such Class, by notice to such holders, which notice shall specify the purchase price (as a percentage of par) at which such purchase will be effected, the maximum amount of Principal Proceeds and Collateral Enhancement Amounts that will be used to effect such purchase and the length of the period during which such offer will be open for acceptance;
(A) each such holder of a Rated Note shall have the right, but not the obligation, to accept such offer in accordance with its terms; and
(B) if the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes of the relevant Class held by holders who accept such offer exceeds the amount of Principal Proceeds specified in such offer, a portion of the Notes of each accepting holder shall be purchased pro rata based on the respective Principal Amount Outstanding held by each such holder subject to adjustment for Authorised Denominations if required;
(iii) each such purchase shall be effected only at prices discounted from par;
(iv) each such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period;
(v) each Coverage Test (other than the Class E Par Value Test) is satisfied immediately prior to each such purchase and will be satisfied after giving effect to such purchase or, if any Coverage Test (other than the Class E Par Value Test) is not satisfied it shall be at least maintained or improved after giving effect to such purchase when compared to such Coverage Test immediately prior thereto;
(vi) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(vii) any Rated Notes to be purchased shall be surrendered to the Registrar for cancellation and may not be reissued or resold;
(viii) each such purchase will otherwise be conducted in accordance with applicable law (including the laws of Ireland); and
(ix) the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall give prior written notice to each Rating Agency then rating any of the Rated Notes of such purchase.
The Registrar shall cancel any such purchased Rated Notes surrendered to it for cancellation. The cancellation (and/or decrease, as applicable) of any such surrendered Rated Notes shall be taken into account for purposes of all relevant calculations.
8. Payments
(a) Method of Payment
Payments of principal upon final redemption in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such Note at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent by wire transfer. Payments of interest on each Note and, prior to redemption in full thereof, principal in respect of each Note, will be made by wire transfer. Upon application of the holder to the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent not less than five Business Days before the due date for any payment in respect of a Note, the payment may be made (in the case of any final payment of principal against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only of such final payment, endorsement) of such Note as provided above) by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, on the due date to a Euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in Western Europe.
(b) Payments
All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives (including FATCA), but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation). No commission shall be charged to the Noteholders.
(c) Payments on Presentation Days
A holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a Presentation Date and shall not, except as provided in Condition 6 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a Presentation Date falls after the due date.
If a Note is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones it is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.
(d) Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agents
The Issuer reserves the right at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Principal Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent and appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will maintain a Principal Paying Agent, as approved in writing by the Trustee and shall procure that it shall at all times maintain a Custodian, Account Bank, Collateral Manager and Collateral Administrator. Notice of any change in any Agent or their specified offices or in the Collateral Manager will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
9. Taxation
All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within Ireland or any other jurisdiction, or any political sub division or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to gross up any payments made to Noteholders of any Class and shall withhold or deduct from any such payments any amounts on account of such tax where so required by law (including FATCA) or any such relevant tax authority. Any withholding or deduction shall not constitute an Event of Default under Condition 10(a) (Events of Default).
Subject as provided below, if the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely absolutely without enquiry or liability) that it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes of any Class become obliged by the laws of Ireland to withhold or account for tax so that it would be unable to make payment of the full amount that would otherwise be due because of the imposition of such tax and that it is unable to cure the consequential Note Tax Event in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event), the Issuer (save as provided below) shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange for the substitution
of a company incorporated in another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee as the principal obligor under the Notes of such Class, or to change its tax residence to another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in relation to such change, provided that the Trustee’s approval shall be subject to confirmation of tax counsel (at the cost of the Issuer and which may be counsel to the Issuer or the Collateral Manager) that such a substitution and/or change in tax residence would be effective in eliminating the imposition of such tax and in accordance with the Trust Deed.
Notwithstanding the above, if any taxes referred to in this Condition 9 (Taxation) arise:
(a) due to any present or former connection of any Noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Noteholder if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, or a corporation) with Ireland (including without limitation, such Noteholder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having had a permanent establishment therein) otherwise than by reason only of the holding of any Note or receiving principal or interest in respect thereof;
(b) by reason of the failure by the relevant Noteholder to comply with any applicable procedures required to establish non residence or other similar claim for exemption from such tax or to provide information concerning nationality, residency or connection with Ireland or other applicable tax authority;
(c) in connection with FATCA; or
(d) any combination of the preceding clauses (a) to (c) inclusive,
the requirement to substitute the Issuer as a principal obligor and/or change its residence for taxation purposes shall not apply.
10. Events of Default
(a) Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute an “Event of Default”:
(i) Non-payment of interest
the Issuer fails to pay any interest in respect of any Class A Notes or the Class B Notes when the same becomes due and payable (save, in each case, as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon in the circumstances described in the Conditions) and failure to pay such interest in such circumstances continues for a period of at least five consecutive Business Days provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least ten consecutive Business Days;
(ii) Non-payment of principal
the Issuer fails to pay any principal when the same becomes due and payable on any Rated Note on the Maturity Date or on any Redemption Date (save in each case as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon as set forth in Condition 9 (Taxation)) provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least ten Business Days after the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or such Paying Agent, as applicable, receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission and provided further that, failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails will not constitute an Event of Default;
(iii) Default under Priorities of Payment
the failure on any Payment Date to disburse amounts (other than as described in Condition 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest) or 10(a)(ii) (Non-payment of principal) above) available in the Payment Account in excess of €10,000 and payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and continuation of such failure for a period of ten Business Days or, in the case of a failure to disburse
due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for ten Business Days after the Collateral Administrator or such Paying Agent, as applicable, receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission;
(iv) Collateral Obligations
on any Measurement Date on and after the Effective Date for so long as any of the Class A Notes are Outstanding, failure of the percentage equivalent of a fraction:
(A) the numerator of which is equal to
(1) the Aggregate Collateral Balance (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) plus

(2) the aggregate, for all Defaulted Obligations, of the lesser of the Moody’s Collateral Value and the S&P Collateral Value in respect of each Defaulted Obligation on such date; and
(B) the denominator of which is equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes to equal or exceed 102.5 per cent;
(v) Breach of Other Obligations
except as otherwise provided in this definition of “Event of Default” a default in a material respect in the performance by, or breach of any material covenant of, the Issuer under the Trust Deed or these Conditions (provided that any failure to meet any Portfolio Profile Test, Collateral Quality Test or Coverage Test is not an Event of Default and any failure to satisfy the Effective Date Determination Requirements is not an Event of Default, except in each case to the extent provided in paragraph (iv) (Collateral Obligations) above) or the failure of any material representation or warranty of the Issuer made in the Trust Deed or these Conditions or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant thereto or in connection therewith to be correct in each case in all respects when the same shall have been made, and the continuation of such default, breach or failure for a period of 45 calendar days after notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager by hand, by registered or certified mail or courier, from the Trustee, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager, or to the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee from the Controlling Class acting pursuant to an Ordinary Resolution, specifying such default, breach or failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default” under the Trust Deed; provided that if the Issuer (as notified to the Trustee by the Collateral Manager in writing) has commenced curing such default, breach or failure during the 45 calendar day period specified above, such default, breach or failure shall not constitute an Event of Default under this Condition 10(a)(v) (Breach of Other Obligations) unless it continues for a period of 60 calendar days (rather than, and not in addition to, such 45 calendar day period specified above) after notice thereof in accordance herewith. For the purposes of this Condition 10(a)(v) (Breach of Other Obligations), the materiality of such default, breach, covenant, representation or warranty shall be determined by the Trustee who shall make such determination by considering whether the default or breach is materially prejudicial to the interests of any Class of Noteholders;
(vi) Insolvency Proceedings
proceedings are initiated against the Issuer under any applicable liquidation, insolvency, examinership, bankruptcy, composition, reorganisation or other similar laws (together, “Insolvency Law”), or a receiver, administrative receiver, trustee, administrator, custodian, conservator, liquidator, examiner, curator or other similar official (an “Insolvency Official”) is appointed in relation to the Issuer or in relation to the whole or any substantial part of the undertaking or assets of the Issuer and in any of the foregoing cases, except in relation to the appointment of an Insolvency Official, is not discharged within 30 days; or the Issuer is subject to, or initiates or consents to judicial proceedings relating to itself under any applicable Insolvency Law, or seeks the appointment of an Insolvency Official, or makes a conveyance or assignment for the benefit of its creditors generally or otherwise becomes subject to any reorganisation or amalgamation (other than on terms previously approved in writing by the Trustee or by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class);
(vii) Illegality
it is or will become unlawful for the Issuer to perform or comply with any one or more of its obligations under the Notes; or
(viii) Investment Company Act
the Issuer or any of the Collateral becomes required to register as an “Investment Company” under the Investment Company Act and such requirement continues for 45 calendar days.
(b) Acceleration
(i) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, (subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) give notice to the Issuer, KBRA and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable (such notice, an “Acceleration Notice”).
(ii) Upon any such notice being given to the Issuer of the maturity of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b)(i) (Acceleration), all of the Notes shall immediately become due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices; provided that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) or 10(a)(vii) (Illegality) above of the definition thereof, an Acceleration Notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices.
(c) Curing of Default
At any time after an Acceleration Notice (whether deemed or otherwise) has been given pursuant to Condition 10(b)(i) (Acceleration) following the occurrence of an Event of Default and prior to enforcement of the security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement), the Trustee shall, if so requested by the Controlling Class, acting by Ordinary Resolution, (and subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) rescind and annul such Acceleration Notice and its consequences if:
(i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or to its order) a sum sufficient to pay:
(A) all overdue payments of interest and principal on the Notes, other than the Subordinated Notes;
(B) all due but unpaid taxes owing by the Issuer, as certified by an Authorised Officer of the Issuer to the Trustee;
(C) all unpaid Administrative Expenses and Trustee Fees and Expenses (in each case, without regard to the Senior Expenses Cap); and
(D) all amounts due and payable by the Issuer under any Hedge Transaction; and
(ii) the Trustee has determined that all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the interest in respect of, or principal of, the Notes that have become due solely as a result of the acceleration thereof under paragraph (b) above due to such Events of Default, have been cured or waived.
All amounts received in respect of this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) shall be distributed two Business Days following payment or the deposit by the Issuer of such amounts, in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.
Any previous rescission and annulment of an Acceleration Notice pursuant to this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) shall not prevent the subsequent acceleration of the Notes if the Trustee, at its discretion or, as subsequently requested, accelerates the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b)(i)
(Acceleration) or if the Notes are automatically accelerated in accordance with Condition 10(b)(ii) (Acceleration).
(d) Restriction on Acceleration of Notes
No acceleration of the Notes shall be permitted pursuant to this Condition 10 (Events of Default) by any Class of Noteholders, other than the Controlling Class as provided in Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(e) Notification and Confirmation of No Default
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) each Hedge Counterparty and the Rating Agencies upon becoming aware of the occurrence of an Event of Default. The Trust Deed contains provision for the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee and the Rating Agencies on an annual basis and upon request that no Event of Default has occurred and that no condition, event or act has occurred which, with the lapse of time and/or the issue, making or giving of any notice, certification, declaration and/or request and/or the taking of any similar action and/or the fulfilment of any similar condition would constitute an Event of Default and that no other matter which is required (pursuant thereto) to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
11. Enforcement

(a) Security Becoming Enforceable
Subject as provided in Condition 11(b) below (Enforcement), the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement over the Collateral shall become enforceable upon an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), subject always to such acceleration of the Notes not having been rescinded or annulled by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default).
(b) Enforcement
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed or the Irish Security Agreement becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion (but subject always to Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition)), and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), institute such proceedings or take any other action against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed, the Irish Security Agreement and the Notes and pursuant and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed, the Irish Security Agreement and the Notes, realise and/or otherwise liquidate or sell the Collateral in whole or in part and/or take such other action as may be permitted under applicable laws against any Obligor in respect of the Collateral and/or take any other action to enforce or realise the security over the Collateral in accordance with the Trust Deed or the Irish Security Agreement, as applicable (such actions together, “Enforcement Actions”), in each case without any liability as to the consequence of such action and without having regard (save to the extent provided in Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)) to the effect of such action on individual Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party, provided however that:
(i) no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless:
(A) subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, the Trustee (or an agent or Appointee on its behalf) (in consultation with the Collateral Manager) determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes and all due and unpaid interest in respect of each Class of Rated Notes up to the anticipated date of redemption) other than the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such amount the “Enforcement Threshold” and such determination being an “Enforcement Threshold Determination”); or
(B) if the Enforcement Threshold will not have been met then:
(1) in the case of an Event of Default specified in Conditions 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest), 10(a)(ii) (Non-payment of principal) or 10(a)(iv) (Collateral Obligations), the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default; or
(2) in the case of any other Event of Default, the holders of each Class of Rated Notes voting separately by Class by way of Ordinary Resolution direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action;
(ii) the Trustee shall not be bound to institute any Enforcement Action or take any other action unless it is directed to do so by the Controlling Class or, in the case of Condition 11(b)(i)(B)(2) (Enforcement), each Class of Rated Notes as applicable, acting by Ordinary Resolution and, in each case, the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith. Following redemption and payment in full of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes the Trustee shall (provided it is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) act upon the directions of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Extraordinary Resolution;
(iii) subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, the Trustee shall determine or shall procure that an Enforcement Agent determines the aggregate proceeds that can be realised pursuant to any Enforcement Action by using reasonable efforts to obtain, with the cooperation of the Collateral Manager (to the extent the Enforcement Agent is not the Collateral Manager), bid prices with respect to each asset comprising the Portfolio from two recognised dealers (as specified by the Collateral Manager in writing) at the time making a market therein and shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or liquidation on the basis of the lower of such bid prices for each such asset. In the event that the Trustee or the Enforcement Agent, as applicable and with the cooperation of the Collateral Manager (to the extent the Enforcement Agent is not the Collateral Manager), is only able to obtain bid prices with respect to an asset from one recognised dealer at the time making a market therein, the Trustee or the Enforcement Agent shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or liquidation on the basis of such one bid price. In addition, for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Portfolio and the execution of a sale or other liquidation thereof in connection with an Enforcement Threshold Determination will be met, the Trustee or the Enforcement Agent may obtain and rely without liability on an opinion of or any advice received from an independent investment banking firm, or other appropriate advisor (the cost of which shall be payable as a Trustee Fee and Expense); and
(iv) the Trustee shall notify the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)), the Issuer, the Agents, the Collateral Manager, any Hedge Counterparty, and, so long as any of the Notes rated by one or more Rating Agency remain Outstanding, each such Rating Agency if it makes an Enforcement Threshold Determination at any time and (b) the Trustee shall notify the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)), the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, any Hedge Counterparty, and, so long as any of the Notes rated by one or more Rating Agency remain Outstanding, each such Rating Agency if it takes any Enforcement Action at any time.

In addition, any purchaser in any such sale which is a Noteholder may deliver Notes held by it in place of payment of the purchase price for such Collateral where the amount payable to such Noteholder in respect of such Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment is equal to or exceeds the purchase moneys so payable.
12. Prescription

(xxvii) to make any modification or amendment determined by the Issuer, as advised by the Collateral Manager (in consultation with legal counsel experienced in such matters), as necessary or advisable for any Class of Rated Notes to not be considered an “ownership interest” as defined for purposes of section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, provided that: (a) the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution consents in writing thereto; and (b) such modification or amendment would not, in the opinion of the Issuer and as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee, be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class (upon which certification and confirmation the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without further enquiry or liability or any consideration of whether the Noteholders of any Class may be prejudiced as a result thereof);
(xxviii) to conform the provisions of the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document or other document delivered in connection with the Notes to the Offering Circular;
(xxix) to enter into one or more supplemental trust deeds or any other modification, authorisation or waiver of the provisions of the Transaction Documents to permit the use of an Alternative Base Rate for the purpose of:
(A) changing the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes from EURIBOR;
(B) replacing references to “LIBOR,” “EURIBOR,” “London Interbank Offered Rate” and “Euro Interbank Offered Rate” (or similar terms) with the Alternative Base Rate when used with respect to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation;
(C) amending provisions which reference an index that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the index applicable to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation to the extent that no such equivalent is available; and
(D) making such other amendments as are necessary or advisable in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager to facilitate the foregoing changes,
provided that:
(1) such amendments and modifications are being undertaken due to (x) a material disruption to LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark, (y) a change in the methodology of calculating LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark or (z) LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark ceasing to exist (or the reasonable expectation of the Collateral Manager that any of the events specified in paragraphs (x), (y) or (z) will occur); and
(2) the Alternative Base Rate shall apply to each Class of Floating Rate Notes; and “Alternative Base Rate” means the greater of (x) zero and (y) the sum of:
(1) the Reference Rate Modifier; and
(2) either (at the reasonable discretion of the Collateral Manager):
(i) any rate (and, if applicable, the methodology for calculating such rate) formally proposed, recommended or recognised as an industry standard rate (whether by letter, protocol, publication of standard terms or otherwise) by, in each case, the most applicable of the Loan Markets Association, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, or the Loan Syndications & Trading Association (or, in each case, any successor organization thereto) as a replacement reference rate for the calculation of the relevant reference rate (or the most appropriate such rate for the context in the Collateral Manager’s reasonable judgement in the event that multiple valid replacement rates are proposed, recommended or recognised);
(ii) if at least 50 per cent. of the Floating Rate Collateral Obligations (by principal balance) in the Portfolio pay interest based on a base rate other than EURIBOR, then the base rate applicable to the greatest percentage of such Floating Rate Collateral Obligations;
(iii) the most common reference rate, other than EURIBOR, used to determine the floating rate of interest on securities issued by collateralised loan obligations whose collateral consists primarily of broadly syndicated Secured Senior Loans denominated in Euro within the prior six months (the determination of which may be based, in the Collateral Manager’s reasonable judgement, on information provided by any of the Rating Agencies, the Placement Agent, or other, similarly situated, nationally recognised firms); or
(iv) any other rate consented to by the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders (in each case, acting by Ordinary Resolution), provided that, if the Issuer requests consent for an Alternative Base Rate from the Controlling Class, any Noteholder of the Controlling Class who does not object to such request within 15 Business Days shall be deemed to have consented to such Alternative Base Rate.
“Reference Rate Modifier” means any modifier recognised or acknowledged by the Loan Market Association, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe or the Loan Syndication & Trading Association (or, in each case, any successor organisation thereto) that is applied to a reference rate in order to cause such rate to be comparable to 3-month EURIBOR or, following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, 6-month EURIBOR, which may consist of an addition to or subtractions from such unadjusted rate.
(xxx) notwithstanding Condition 14(c)(xxvi) (Modification and Waiver), to modify the Weighted Average Life Test definition by extending the date contained therein by:
(A) 15 months or less, with the consent of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution); or
(B) more than 15 months, with the consent of the Controlling Class, the Class B-1 Noteholders and the Class B-2 Noteholders, each acting by way of Ordinary Resolution.
Any such modification, authorisation or waiver shall be binding on the Noteholders and shall be notified by the Issuer as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of any trust deed supplemental
to the Trust Deed or any other modification, authorisation or waiver pursuant to this Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) to:
(i) so long as any of the Notes rated by one or more Rating Agencies remains Outstanding, each such Rating Agency; and
(ii) the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
Subject to its compliance with applicable law, the Issuer agrees that it shall notify the Hedge Counterparty of any amendment made to any Transaction Document as soon as reasonably practicable after any such amendment is made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and in the Trust Deed, the Issuer shall not agree to amend, modify or supplement any provisions of the Transaction Documents if such change shall have a material adverse effect (as reasonably determined by the Hedge Counterparty) on the rights or obligations of a Hedge Counterparty without such Hedge Counterparty’s prior written consent.
To the extent required pursuant to a Hedge Agreement, the Issuer shall notify each Hedge Counterparty of any proposed amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents and seek the prior consent of such Hedge Counterparty(ies) in respect thereof, in each case to the extent required in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such notice shall only be given and such consent shall only be sought to the extent required above or in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. If a Hedge Agreement allows a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request, during such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer shall not make any such proposed amendment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party (unless expressly stated in this Condition), concur with the Issuer, in making any modification, amendment, waiver or supplement pursuant to the paragraphs above whether or not such modification, amendment, waiver or supplement may be or is prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders (or any of them) (other than a modification, waiver or supplement pursuant to paragraphs
(xi) and (xii) above) to the Transaction Documents, which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee is required (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely without enquiry and without liability), provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged to agree to any modification, amendment, waiver or supplement which, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the rights, powers, authorisations, indemnities or protections, of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents.
In the case of a modification, amendment, waiver or supplement pursuant to paragraphs (xi) and (xii) above, under no circumstances shall the Trustee be required to give such consent on less than 21 days’ notice and the Trustee shall be entitled to obtain legal, financial or other expert advice, at the expense of the Issuer, and rely on such advice in connection with giving such consent as it sees fit.
(d) Substitution
The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee to agree, subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed and such other conditions as the Trustee may require (without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party), to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes of each Class, if required for taxation purposes, provided that such substitution would not, in the opinion of the Trustee, be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, but subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation (subject to receipt of such information and/or opinions as the Rating Agency may require), to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed, provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. Any substitution agreed by the Trustee pursuant to this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) shall be binding on the Noteholders, and shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may reasonably require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may reasonably direct.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin any material amendments or modifications to the Conditions, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to Euronext Dublin.
(e) Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest
In connection with the exercise of its trusts, powers, duties and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)), the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of each Class of Noteholders as a Class and shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise for individual Noteholders of such Class and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 9 (Taxation).
The Trust Deed provides that if there is any conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of:
(i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; and
(vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders.
If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by principal amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater aggregate principal amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that, except as provided otherwise in any applicable Transaction Document or the Conditions of the Notes, the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution as applicable (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes.
In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person and no Secured Party shall have any claim against the Trustee for so doing.
15. Indemnification of the Trustee

The Trust Deed and the Irish Security Agreement contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving it from instituting proceedings to enforce repayment or to enforce the security constituted by or pursuant to the Trust Deed or the Irish Security Agreement, unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document and any entity related to the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document without accounting for any profit. The Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft of the Collateral from any obligation to insure, or to monitor the provisions of any insurance arrangements in respect of, the Collateral (for the avoidance of doubt, under the Trust Deed the Trustee is under no such obligation) and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held by the Custodian or is otherwise held in safe custody by a bank or other custodian. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the performance by the Custodian of any of its duties under the Agency Agreement or for the performance by the Collateral Manager of any of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, for the performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or for the performance by any other person appointed by the Issuer in relation to the Notes or by any other party to any Transaction Document. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for the administration, management or operation of the Collateral including any request by the Collateral Manager to release any of the Collateral from time to time.
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement of the Trustee and the removal of the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, but no such retirement or removal shall become effective until a successor trustee is appointed.
16. Notices
Notices to Noteholders will be valid if posted to the address of such Noteholder appearing in the Register at the time of publication of such notice by pre-paid, first class mail (or any other manner approved by the Trustee which may be by electronic transmission) and (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require) shall be sent to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders:
(a) in the case of inland mail, three calendar days after the date of dispatch thereof;
(b) in the case of overseas mail, seven calendar days after the dispatch thereof; or
(c) in the case of electronic transmission, on the date of dispatch.
Notices will be valid and will be deemed to have been given, for so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin, when such notice is filed in the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require.
The Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Noteholders (or a category of them) if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the rules of the stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Noteholders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.
17. Additional Issuances
(a) The Issuer may from time to time, subject to the approval of (i) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); (ii) in the case of the issuance of additional Class A Notes, subject to the approval of the Class A Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); (iii) the Retention Holder and (iv) the Collateral Manager, create and issue further Notes having the same terms and conditions as existing Classes of Notes (subject as provided below) and which shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Outstanding Notes of each such Class (unless otherwise provided), and will use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations, provided that the following conditions are met:
(i) such additional issuances in relation to the applicable Class of Notes may not exceed 100 per cent. in the aggregate of the original aggregate principal amount of such Class of Notes;

(iii) in relation to an additional issuance of the Class B Notes, such additional issuance shall be (A) an additional issuance solely of the Class B-1 Notes or (B) if such additional issuance is in relation to both the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes, such additional Class B-1 Notes and Class B-2 Notes must be issued in a proportionate amount among the Class B-1 Notes and Class B-2 Notes so that the relative proportions of aggregate principal amount of the Class B-1 Notes and Class B-2 Notes existing immediately prior to such additional issuance remain unchanged immediately following such additional issuance;
(iv) such additional Notes must be of each Class of Notes and issued in a proportionate amount among the Classes so that the relative proportions of aggregate principal amount of the Classes of Notes existing immediately prior to such additional issuance remain unchanged immediately following such additional issuance (save with respect to Subordinated Notes as described in paragraph (c) below;

(ix) so long as the existing Notes of the Class of Notes to be issued are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin) the additional Notes of such Class to be issued are in accordance with the requirements of Euronext Dublin and are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin (for so long as the rules of Euronext Dublin so require);
(x) such additional issuances are in accordance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, the securities and banking laws and regulations of Ireland and do not adversely affect the Irish tax position of the Issuer;
(xi) the Issuer and the Trustee will have received advice of tax counsel of nationally recognised standing in the United States experienced in such matters to the effect that any additional Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and any additional Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes; provided, however, that the advice of tax counsel described in this Condition 17(a)(xi) (Additional Issuances) will not be required with respect to any additional Notes that bear a different securities identifier from the Notes of the same Class that are Outstanding at the time of the additional issuance; and
(xii) the Retention Holder consenting to purchase a sufficient amount of each Class of Notes which is the subject of such additional issuance such that its holding equals no less than 5 per cent. of the nominal value of such Class or Classes of Notes.
(b) Subject to the requirements in Condition 17(a) (Additional Issuances) above (except for the conditions in Condition 17(a)(vii), (xi) and (xii) (Additional Issuances)), the Issuer may issue and sell additional Subordinated Notes (without issuing Notes of any other Class) provided that:
(i) the subordination terms of such Subordinated Notes are identical to the terms of the previously issued Subordinated Notes;

(A) invested in Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments or, pending such investment, deposited in, the Unused Proceeds Account prior to the expiry of the Initial Investment Period or the Principal Account after the expiry of the Initial Investment Period and in each case invested in Eligible Investments, provided that the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall not be obliged to enter into any binding commitments to purchase Collateral Obligations with such proceeds, until such proceeds have been deposited into the Unused Proceeds Account or the Principal Account (as applicable); or
(B) used for other Permitted Uses;
(iv) the Issuer must notify the Rating Agencies then rating any Notes of such additional issuance;
(v) the holders of the Subordinated Notes shall have been notified in writing 30 calendar days prior to such issuance or such shorter period as may be approved by the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) by the Issuer and shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Subordinated Notes in an amount not to exceed the Anti-Dilution Percentage of such additional Subordinated Notes and on the same terms offered to investors generally; and
(vi) such additional issuance is in accordance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, the securities and banking laws and regulations of Ireland and do not adversely affect the Irish tax position of the Issuer.

The proceeds of any such issuance hereunder shall be deposited in the Principal Account and shall constitute Principal Proceeds.
References in these Conditions to the “Notes” include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other notes issued pursuant to this Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) and forming a single series with the Notes. Any further securities forming a single series with Notes constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental to it shall be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed.
18. Third Party Rights

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Note under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
19. Governing Law
(a) Governing Law
The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Irish
Security Agreement and the Corporate Services Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Irish law.
(b) Jurisdiction
The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non-contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process
The Issuer appoints Ocorian Corporate Services (UK) Limited (having an office, at the date hereof, at Level 5, 20 Fenchurch Street, London, EC3M 3BY, England) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer ceases to have such an in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees, expenses and other amounts payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) are expected to be approximately €298,200,000. Such proceeds will be paid into the Collection Account and used by the Issuer in payment of all net amounts due and payable in connection with the acquisition of Collateral Obligations on or prior to the Issue Date and net amounts due and payable in connection with the Warehouse Arrangements (without any duplications) (as further described in the section of this Offering Circular titled “The Portfolio – Acquisition of Collateral Obligations”) and to fund the First Period Reserve Account on the Issue Date. The remaining proceeds shall be transferred from the Collection Account and retained in the Unused Proceeds Account.
FORM OF THE NOTES
References below to Notes and to the Global Certificates and the Definitive Certificates representing such Notes are to each respective Class of Notes, except as otherwise indicated.
Initial Issue of Notes
The Regulation S Notes of each Class (other than the Subordinated Notes) will be represented on issue by a Regulation S Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may not be held by a U.S. Person or U.S. Resident at any time. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. Person, and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest only to a person whom the seller reasonably believes
(a) to be a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, or (b) to be a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than the Subordinated Notes) will be represented on issue by a Rule 144A Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may only be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, amongst other things, that it is a QIB/QP and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
Beneficial interests in Global Certificates will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and as set forth in Rule 144A and the Investment Company Act, and the Notes will bear the applicable legends regarding the restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”. In the case of each Class of Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes), a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate in denominations greater than or equal to the minimum denominations applicable to interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Registrar or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) to the effect that the transferor reasonably believes that the transferee is a QIB/QP and that such transaction is in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificates may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Registrar or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) from the transferor to the effect that the transfer is being made to a non-U.S. Person and in accordance with Regulation S.
Any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate and become an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate for as long as it remains such an interest. Any beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate and become an interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate for so long as it remains such an interest. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
On the Issue Date, an acquirer of a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on
behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person unless such acquirer: (i) receives the written consent of the Issuer; and (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed. Other than on the Issue Date, an acquirer of a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person unless such acquirer: (i) receives the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed); and (iii) other than with respect to Retention Notes, holds such Class E Note or Class F Note, as applicable, in the form of a Definitive Certificate. Any Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate shall be registered in the name of the holder thereof. Each purchaser and transferee understands and agrees that no transfer of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or any interest therein) will be permitted or recognised if it would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class).
The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will be offered outside the United States to non-
U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S and within the United States to persons who are both QIBs and QPs. The Notes are not issuable in bearer form.
The Subordinated Notes will only be issued in the form of Definitive Certificates.
Amendments to Terms and Conditions
Each Global Certificate contains provisions that apply to the Notes that they represent, some of which modify the effect of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes in definitive form (See “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”). The following is a summary of those provisions:
 Payments: Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate will be made to the registered holder and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the relevant Notes, upon surrender of such Global Certificate to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Agent as shall have been notified to the relevant Noteholders for such purpose. On each occasion on which a payment of interest (unless the Notes represented thereby do not bear interest) or principal is made in respect of the relevant Global Certificate, the Registrar shall note the same in the Register and, in relation to payments of principal, cause the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by a Global Certificate to be decreased accordingly.
 Notices: So long as any Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Noteholders shall be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for delivery thereof as required by the Conditions of such Notes provided that such notice is also made to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin for so long as such Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require. Such notice will be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the date of delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system.
 Prescription: Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate will become void unless presented for payment within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the date on which any payment first becomes due.
 Meetings: The holder of each Global Certificate will be treated as being one person for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each €1,000 of principal amount of Notes for which the relevant Global Certificate may be exchanged.
 Trustee’s Powers: In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificates are held on behalf of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders
with entitlements to each Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of any Global Certificate.
 Cancellation: Cancellation of any Note required by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes to be cancelled will be effected by reduction in the principal amount of the Notes on the Register, with a corresponding notation made on the applicable Global Certificate.
 Optional Redemption: The Subordinated Noteholders’ and the Controlling Class’ option in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) (as applicable) may be exercised by the holder(s) of a Definitive Certificate or a Global Certificate (as applicable) representing Subordinated Notes or the Controlling Class (as applicable) giving notice to the Registrar or other Agent specified for such purpose of the principal amount of Subordinated Notes or Notes representing the Controlling Class (as applicable) in respect of which the option is exercised and presenting such Definitive Certificate or Global Certificate (as applicable) for endorsement of exercise within the time limit specified in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
 Record Date: The Record Date will mean the close of business on the Clearing System Business Day before the relevant due date for payment of principal and interest in respect of such security.
“Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are open for business.
Exchange for Definitive Certificates

Exchange

Each Global Certificate will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Definitive Exchange Date (as defined below), in whole but not in part, for Definitive Certificates if a Global Certificate is held (directly or indirectly) on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or an alternative clearing system and any such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces its intention to permanently cease business or does in fact do so, provided the relevant Noteholder provides a declaration in the form prescribed by section 64(7) of the TCA to the Issuer.
Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes may be exchangeable for interests in Definitive Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes if a transferee is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person provided: (i) such transferee has obtained the written consent of the Issuer in respect of such transfer; (ii) the transferee has provided the Issuer and a Transfer Agent with an ERISA certificate in or substantially in the form set out in Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed; and (iii) such transferee has provided a Relevant Declaration to the Issuer. Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes may be exchangeable for interests in Definitive Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes as amended above. The Subordinated Notes will only be issued in the form of Definitive Certificates.
The Registrar will not register the transfer of, or exchange of interests in, a Global Certificate for Definitive Certificates during the period from (but excluding) the Record Date to (and including) the date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.
If only one of the Global Certificates (the “Exchanged Global Certificate”) becomes exchangeable for Definitive Certificates in accordance with the above paragraphs, transfers of Notes may not take place between, on the one hand, persons holding Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Exchanged Global Certificate and, on the other hand, persons wishing to purchase beneficial interests in the other Global Certificate.
“Definitive Exchange Date” means a day falling not less than 30 calendar days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar and any Transfer Agent is located.
Delivery

In the event a Global Certificate is to be exchanged, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any relevant Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with: (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Certificates; and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under “Transfer Restrictions” below.
Legends

The holder of a Class E Note or Class F Note represented by a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, may transfer the Notes represented thereby in whole or in part in the applicable minimum denomination by surrendering such Note(s) at the specified office of the Registrar or any Transfer Agent, together with the completed form of transfer and to the extent applicable, written consent of the Issuer and a duly completed ERISA certificate (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed). Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, bearing the legend referred to under “Transfer Restrictions” below, or upon specific request for removal of the legend on a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, the Issuer will deliver only Definitive Certificates that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act.

Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

RATINGS OF THE NOTES

General
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Rated Notes be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes: “Aaa (sf)” from Moody’s, “AAA(sf)” from KBRA and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B-1 Notes: “Aa2 (sf)” from Moody’s, “AA(sf)” from KBRA and “AA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B-2 Notes: “Aa2 (sf)” from Moody’s, “AA(sf)” from KBRA and “AA(sf)” from S&P; the Class C Notes: “A-(sf)” from KBRA and “A- (sf)” from S&P; the Class D Notes: “BBB-(sf)” from KBRA and “BBB-(sf)” from S&P; and the Class E Notes: “BB-(sf)” from KBRA and “BB-(sf)” from S&P; and the Class F Notes: “B3(sf)” from Moody’s and “B-(sf)” from S&P. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.
In respect of any Notes that are subject to a Refinancing in accordance with Condition 7(b)(v)(A) (Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Whole), the ratings assigned to the Notes will not necessarily continue to be assigned to the Refinancing Obligations issued pursuant thereto.
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.
Each of S&P and KBRA is established in the EU and Moody’s is established in the UK. As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is registered under CRA3 and included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Moody’s Ratings
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.
Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry.
There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.
In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.
KBRA Ratings
The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by KBRA address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by KBRA address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
KBRA’s process for analysing structured credit transactions broadly consists of the following five components:
(a) Collateral Analysis: KBRA will review the collateral in the portfolio and establish an assumption for the credit quality, industry / sector classification and recovery rate for each asset.
(b) Portfolio Level Analysis: Create a model portfolio based on the collateral limitations outlined in the transaction documents and then calculate the expected gross default rate of the portfolio at each rating level. The calculation of the portfolio’s expected default rates is based upon the evaluation of the portfolio’s credit quality and diversity, as derived from the collateral analysis performed. The expected gross default rates are then used as inputs in the cash flow analysis process.
(c) Transaction and Structure Analysis: Review the transactions documents to evaluate the transaction’s overall structure, including payment priorities, performance triggers, reinvestment provisions and events
of default, amongst others. KBRA will also review the issuer to determine whether the risk of bankruptcy is sufficiently remote.
(d) Cash Flow Analysis: KBRA will use a cash flow model to test the resiliency of a transaction’s structure against varying interest rate vectors, default timing vectors, weighted average spread assumptions and recovery rate assumptions, amongst other factors. The results of the cash flow analysis will provide insight into the expected losses of each tranche under the various cash flow scenarios tested.
(e) Collateral Manager Review: As part of the rating process, KBRA performs an analysis of the collateral manager’s operations, experience and investment process, amongst other factors, to evaluate the manager’s ability to maintain the portfolio according to the transaction’s governing documents.
KBRA’s ratings of the relevant Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.
There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by KBRA in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by KBRA.
S&P Ratings
The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the other Rated Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and
(c) legal considerations.
Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the Effective Date until the end of the Reinvestment Period.
S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.
Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.
There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee or the Placement Agent, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.
S&P’s ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.

THE RETENTION HOLDER AND EU RETENTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
The information appearing in the section entitled “Undertakings” below consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Risk Retention Letter and does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such letter.

Description of the Retention Holder
The Collateral Manager shall act as the Retention Holder for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements, subject as provided below.
The Retention

Background

On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager in its capacity as Retention Holder, acting on its own account, will sign the Risk Retention Letter addressed to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Sole Arranger and the Placement Agent.
The Retention Holder intends to hold the requisite risk retention in its capacity as “originator” pursuant to the EU Retention Requirements.
The Retention Holder reasonably believes that it has established, and will manage, the CLO transaction described in this Offering Circular. The Retention Holder will also represent and warrant in the Risk Retention Letter, that the Originator Requirement (as defined below) has been satisfied on the Issue Date.
“Originated Assets” means Collateral Obligations (i) which the Retention Holder has undertaken to acquire from the Issuer pursuant to the Conditional Sale Agreement in the event that any such Collateral Obligation becomes a Defaulted Obligation during the relevant Seasoning Period for such Collateral Obligation, and (ii) which the Retention Holder or its related entities were directly or indirectly involved in the original agreement which created such Collateral Obligations.
“Originator Requirement” means the requirement which will be satisfied if, on the Issue Date:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Originated Assets that have been originated by the Retention Holder; divided by
(b) the Target Par Amount,
is greater than or equal to 5 per cent.
On the basis of the paragraphs above, and the undertakings, representations, warranties and acknowledgements to be given by the Retention Holder set out below, the Retention Holder reasonably believes that it is an “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements and is an eligible retainer for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements.
Undertakings

Under the Risk Retention Letter, the Retention Holder will, for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding, and subject as provided below:
(a) covenant and undertake:
(i) to subscribe for, hold and retain, on an ongoing basis, in its capacity as originator for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding, a material net economic interest in the form specified in Article 6(3)(a) of the Securitisation Regulation, of not less than 5 per cent. of the outstanding nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to investors on the Issue Date within the meaning of the EU Retention Requirements (where for such purpose the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall be considered a single “tranche”) (the “Retention Notes”) and not less than 5 per cent. of the principal amount of any outstanding Reinvestment Amounts (together with the Retention Notes, the “Retention”);
(ii) that neither it nor its Affiliates will transfer the Retention or sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under or associated with the Retention or the underlying portfolio of Collateral Obligations, except (i) with respect to such hedging or mitigation of credit risk, to the extent permitted by the EU Retention Requirements, and (ii) with respect to such transfer or sale, as provided below;
(iii) subject to any overriding regulatory requirements, to take such further reasonable action, provide such information relating to its holding of the Retention, and enter into such other agreements, in each case as may reasonably be required by the Issuer to satisfy the EU Retention Requirements in force as at the Issue Date for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding, provided that as regards the provision of information (i) such information is in the possession of the Retention Holder, and (ii) only to the extent the same is not subject to a duty of confidentiality, at the cost and expense of the party requesting such further action;
(iv) to provide to the Issuer, on a confidential basis, information in the possession of the Retention Holder, at the cost and expense of the party seeking such information, to the extent the same is not subject to a duty of confidentiality;
(v) to confirm its continued compliance with the covenants set out at paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above:
(A) promptly upon reasonable request made in writing by any of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Sole Arranger and the Placement Agent; and
(B) in any event on a monthly basis, on the Business Day prior to the date on which the Collateral Administrator compiles the Monthly Report, to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Sole Arranger and the Placement Agent,
in each case in writing (which may be by way of e-mail and which confirmations the Retention Holder acknowledges may be included by the Collateral Administrator in any Monthly Report);
(vi) that it shall immediately notify the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Sole Arranger and the Placement Agent in writing (which may be by way of e-mail) if for any reason:
(A) it ceases to hold the Retention in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above;
(B) it fails to comply with the covenants set out in paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) in any way; or
(C) any of the representations and warranties contained in the Risk Retention Letter fail to be true on any date; and
(vii) that it is not an entity that has been established or that operates for the sole purpose of securitising exposures as further defined and set out in the Securitisation Regulation;
(b) acknowledge and confirm that the Retention Holder reasonably believes that it has established and is managing the transaction contemplated by the Transaction Documents; and
(c) represent that, in relation to each Collateral Obligation acquired by the Issuer in satisfaction of the Originator Requirement, the Retention Holder either:
(i) assumed the credit risk with respect to such Collateral Obligation during the relevant Seasoning Period for such Collateral Obligation by committing to purchase such Collateral Obligation from the Issuer in the event that such Collateral Obligation became a Defaulted Obligation within the relevant Seasoning Period for such Collateral Obligation; or
(ii) either itself or through related entities, directly or indirectly, was involved in the original agreement which created such asset.
Notwithstanding the above, the Retention Holder may transfer the Retention only:
(a) if and to the extent such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention Requirements; and
(b) if such transfer is to a Person which will commit to retain the Retention subject to and in accordance with the EU Retention Requirements and such Person enters into an agreement on terms substantially identical (mutatis mutandis) to those outlined above.
Without limitation to the above, upon a resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement:
(a) subject to satisfaction of the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) immediately above, the Retention may be transferred to the replacement collateral manager on the basis that such replacement collateral manager shall be the Retention Holder; or
(b) otherwise, the Collateral Manager shall remain the Retention Holder and be bound by the retention undertakings described above, notwithstanding that it will no longer act as collateral manager with respect to the transaction described in this Offering Circular.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator (in the case of the Collateral Administrator, solely in connection with the Retention Holder’s covenants referred to in sub-paragraphs (a)(v) and (vi) above), the Sole Arranger and the Placement Agent are each parties to the Risk Retention Letter solely for the purposes of obtaining the benefit of the representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings contained therein and under no circumstances shall any of them be deemed to have undertaken any obligations thereunder or by virtue of their entry into the Risk Retention Letter.
With respect to the EU Retention Requirements, each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction are sufficient to comply with the EU Retention Requirements or any other regulatory requirement. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Retention Holder, the Sole Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such Person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the EU Retention Requirements or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements” above, and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” below. The Retention Holder may, to the extent permitted under the EU Retention Requirements but will not have any obligation to, change the quantum, method or nature of its holding of the Retention as a result of any changes to the EU Retention Requirements following the Issue Date or any other changes to regulations or the interpretation thereof.
Origination of Collateral Obligations

General

By way of background, the Securitisation Regulation definition of an “originator” refers to an entity which:
(a) itself or through related entities, directly or indirectly, was involved in the original agreement which created the obligations or potential obligations of the debtor or potential debtor giving rise to the exposures being securitised; or
(b) purchases a third party’s exposures on its own account and then securitises them.
Article 3(4)(a) of the regulatory technical standards adopted by the EU Commission on 13 March 2014 provides that, where the securitised exposures are created by multiple originators (as is the case in a managed CLO, where assets are acquired from numerous sellers in the market), the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements may be fulfilled in full by a single originator in circumstances where the relevant originator has established and is managing the scheme.
Origination

The Retention Holder has entered into a conditional sale agreement (the “Conditional Sale Agreement”) between the Retention Holder (as purchaser) and the Issuer (as seller). Pursuant to the terms of the Conditional Sale Agreement, the Issuer shall, in the event any asset the subject of such Conditional Sale Agreement (each an “Originated Asset”) becomes a Defaulted Obligation within 15 Business Days (the “Seasoning Period”) of the date upon which the Issuer (or the Retention Holder on its behalf) entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation, have the right to require the Retention Holder to purchase from it the relevant Originated Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Originated Asset. The Retention Holder will ensure that, on or before the Issue Date, Originated Assets with an aggregate notional amount of not less than 5 per cent. of the Target Par Amount have been subject to the Seasoning Period under the terms of the Conditional Sale Agreement.
Transparency Requirements
The following description of the transparency requirements consists of a summary of certain provisions of the transparency requirements which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not defined in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.

In accordance with Article 7(2) of the Securitisation Regulation, each of the originator, the sponsor and the Issuer are required to designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the reporting obligations of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer has undertaken to be designated as the entity (the “Designated Reporting Entity”) responsible to fulfil the reporting obligations of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation and to adhere to its obligations in respect thereof.
The Collateral Manager will, at the expense of the Issuer, undertake, subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject to and in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, reasonably assist the Issuer in complying with its obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements, including by providing to the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) subject to any confidentiality undertaking given by the Collateral Manager or to which the Collateral Manager is subject, any reports, data and other information:
(a) which are in the possession of the Collateral Manager;
(b) which are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure (unless the relevant information can be summarised or disclosed in an anonymised form, in accordance with such legal or contractual restrictions on disclosure); and
(c) to which the Collateral Administrator (or any applicable third party reporting entity) does not otherwise have access or which are not otherwise in the Collateral Administrator’s possession, required for compliance by the Issuer with the EU Transparency Requirements provided that the Collateral Manager shall not be responsible or liable for failing to provide any reports, data and other information that the Collateral Manager is unable to procure or source using reasonable efforts.
The Collateral Administrator, on behalf of (and at the expense of) the Issuer and in consultation with the Collateral Manager, shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, compile each of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, in each case in the form required by and in accordance with the frequency requirements set out in the EU Transparency Requirements and subject to the receipt by the Collateral Administrator of any reports, data and other information that is not otherwise in its possession or reasonably available to it as is necessary in connection with the preparation thereof.
The Collateral Administrator shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, make such Loan Reports and Investor Reports (each as defined below), together with any other information, data and reports (as may be provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available to the Relevant Recipients via the Reporting Website or such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as notified to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Administrator shall not assume any statutory responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency
Requirements. In making available such information, documents and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and any potential Noteholders (including for their use or onward disclosure of any such information, documentation or reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents. Any such reports may refer to disclaimers excluding liability of the Collateral Administrator for the information provided therein.
The Issuer with reasonable assistance of the Collateral Manager shall procure that (i) any disclosure as required by Articles 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(g) of the Securitisation Regulation is published without delay and (ii) copies of the relevant Transaction Documents required to be disclosed pursuant to the EU Transparency Requirements and this Offering Circular in final form are made available as soon as is reasonably practicable following the issuance of the Notes).
Retention Holder Credit Granting and Selection of Assets

Comparable Assets

The Retention Holder has not selected Originated Assets to be transferred to, or acquired by, the Issuer with the intention of rendering losses on such assets, over a maximum period of 4 years, higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on the balance sheet of the originator.
Credit Granting Criteria

As an entity established in a country outside of the European Union, the Retention Holder reasonably believes, in light of the information available to it, that it has granted all credits in respect of each Originated Asset on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and has clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes to ensure that credit-granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligors’ creditworthiness.
See further “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements” above.
THE PORTFOLIO
Terms used and not otherwise defined herein or in this Offering Circular as specifically referenced herein shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.

Introduction
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required or, as the case may be, authorised, to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer, in each case to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.
Acquisition of Collateral Obligations
The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by or on the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager on its behalf will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals at least approximately €296,500,000, representing approximately 98.8 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (as defined in the Conditions of the Notes). A portion of the Collateral Obligations will be sourced from one or more funds managed by the Collateral Manager. The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of (a) certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes payable on or about the Issue Date and following completion of the issue of the Notes (including, without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account and the First Period Reserve Account) and (b) the acquisition costs of any Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (if applicable), are expected to be approximately €3,450,000. Such remaining net proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account.
During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Obligations not subsequently reinvested subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) (together with any Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account and any Principal Proceeds in the Principal Account (without duplication including Eligible Investments).
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 15 June 2021 (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next following Business Day), subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
Any Trading Gains realised in respect of any Collateral Obligation that the Collateral Manager determines, in its discretion, shall be paid in to the Interest Account if: (1) after giving effect to such designation as Interest Proceeds, and the distribution thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lesser of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; (2) after giving effect to such designation as Interest Proceeds, the aggregate cumulative amount of Trading Gains designated as Interest Proceeds and deposited into the Interest Account is no greater than 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount, then the Collateral Manager may, in its discretion, determine that any such Trading Gains shall be paid into the Interest Account upon receipt; and (3) after giving effect to such designation as Interest Proceeds, the Class E Par Value Test shall be satisfied.
On or after the Effective Date, but before the second Payment Date, the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account will be transferred to the Principal Account and/or the Interest Account, in each case, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer), provided that, in respect of any such transfer to the Interest Account (i) the Aggregate Collateral Balance equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount
immediately prior to and following such transfer (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Collateral Balance, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value); and (ii) the amount paid to the Interest Account from the Unused Proceeds Account pursuant to Condition 3(j)(iii)(4) (Unused Proceeds Account) and to the Interest Account from the Principal Account pursuant to Condition 3(j)(i)(5) (Principal Account) in aggregate shall not exceed 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
Within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date or, otherwise, as soon as reasonably practicable (which may be longer), the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the “Effective Date Report”) containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Obligations such that the Aggregate Collateral Balance equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Collateral Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value); and the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide confirmation of receipt to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (with a copy to the Collateral Manager, if applicable), of an accountants’ certificate confirming the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at such date, the computations and results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests by reference to such Collateral Obligations.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that (i) if the Effective Date S&P Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been given by S&P, and (ii) if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been given by Moody’s.
If the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied within 35 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify S&P and/or if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 35 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s.
If:
(i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies, or Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation is not received in respect of a Rating Confirmation Plan presented by the Collateral Manager upon request therefor by the Collateral Manager;
(ii) the Effective Date Moody’s Condition has not been satisfied and following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s is not received; or
(iii) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied and following a request therefor from the Collateral Manager following the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P is not received,
an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event.
If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations and/or any other intended action which
is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.

Restructured Obligations
If a Collateral Obligation becomes the subject of a restructuring whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation (including but not limited to an amendment of its maturity date) or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor and, for the avoidance of doubt, such restructuring is in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganisation, debt restructuring or workout of the Obligor thereof, such obligation shall only constitute a Restructured Obligation if such obligation has an S&P Rating and, for so long as Moody’s assigns a rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, a Moody’s Rating and satisfies each of the criteria comprising the Eligibility Criteria other than the criteria set out at paragraphs (c), (g), (i), (n), (z), (aa), (ee) and (ff) on the related Restructuring Date, provided that in the case of an obligation which, as a result of such restructuring, would have a Stated Maturity falling on or after the Maturity Date of the Notes (a “Long-Dated Restructured Obligation”), not more than 20 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “Bsf”)) shall consist of, together, the Aggregate Principal Balance of Long-Dated Restructured Obligations and Long-Dated Maturity Date Obligations (such applicable criteria, the “Restructured Obligation Criteria”).
With regard to paragraph (m) of the Eligibility Criteria, to the extent that the Restructured Obligation is tendered at an amount which is less than its outstanding principal amount, it shall be carried at that tendered value in the Collateral Quality Tests, the Coverage Tests, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and the Portfolio Profile Tests, so long as the tender option is still available. For the avoidance of doubt, a Cashless Loan shall be treated as the acquisition by the Issuer of a new Collateral Obligation and not as the acquisition of a Restructured Obligation. Whilst PIK Securities are not eligible to be Collateral Obligations under the Eligibility Criteria, up to 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may consist of PIK Securities provided that such PIK Securities are Restructured Obligations only.
“Cashless Loan” means a loan obligation which is the reconstitution of a Collateral Obligation that does not involve the receipt by the Issuer of a principal repayment in exchange for the new loan obligation. For the avoidance of doubt a Collateral Obligation, or Participation thereof that is the subject of a Maturity Amendment (as defined below) shall not by virtue of the Maturity Amendment alone, constitute a Cashless Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which imposes any restrictions or conditions on the sale or disposal of Collateral Obligations, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to sell each Collateral Obligation in the event that it determines in its sole discretion, at any time after the date of acquisition thereof, that such Collateral Obligation (contrary to the opinion of the Collateral Manager at such time) did not in fact satisfy one or more of the Eligibility Criteria at the time of acquisition thereof, provided that this shall not in any way lessen the obligation of the Collateral Manager to ensure that each Collateral Obligation satisfies each of the Eligibility Criteria upon the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) entering into a binding commitment to purchase such obligation in accordance with the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Management of the Portfolio

Overview

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is permitted, in certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to sell Collateral Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities and to reinvest the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Collateral Manager) thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations.
Prior to any proposed sale of any Collateral Obligations and/or Exchanged Equity Securities, or reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, the Collateral Manager shall notify the Collateral Administrator of all necessary details (to the extent available to the Collateral Manager) of the Collateral Obligation or Exchanged Equity Security proposed to be sold (as applicable) and the proposed Substitute Collateral Obligation to be purchased.
The Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) shall determine and shall provide confirmation of whether the Portfolio Profile Tests and Reinvestment Criteria which are required to be satisfied, maintained or improved (as applicable) in connection with any such sale or reinvestment are satisfied, maintained or improved (as applicable) or, if any such criteria are not satisfied, maintained or improved (as applicable), shall notify the Issuer and the Collateral Manager of the reasons and the extent to which such criteria are not so satisfied, maintained or improved (as applicable).
The Collateral Manager will determine and use reasonable endeavours to cause to be purchased by the Issuer, Collateral Obligations (including all Substitute Collateral Obligations) taking into account the Eligibility Criteria and, where applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria and will monitor the performance of the Collateral Obligations on an ongoing basis to the extent practicable using sources of information reasonably available to it and provided that the Collateral Manager shall not be responsible for determining whether or not the terms of any individual Collateral Obligation have been observed.
The activities referred to below that the Collateral Manager may undertake on behalf of the Issuer are subject to the Issuer’s monitoring of the performance of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Sale of Collateral Obligations

Sale of Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Obligations

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell any Issue Date Collateral Obligations which do not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date (each a “Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Obligation”). Any Sale Proceeds received in connection therewith may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or credited to the Principal Account pending such reinvestment.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations

Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) subject to:
(a) the Collateral Manager’s knowledge, without the need for inquiry or investigation, that no Event of Default has occurred which is continuing; and
(b) the Collateral Manager certifying to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (upon which certificate the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it believes, in its reasonable business judgment, that such security constitutes a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation as the case may be.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Exchanged Equity Securities

Any Exchanged Equity Security or any Workout Obligation may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Collateral Manager) reinvested in Substitute Collateral
Obligations, subject to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge, having made all reasonable enquiries to ensure the same is true, no Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
In addition to any discretionary sale of Exchanged Equity Securities as provided above, the Collateral Manager shall be required by the Issuer to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell (on behalf of the Issuer) any Exchanged Equity Security which constitutes Margin Stock, as soon as practicable upon its receipt or upon its becoming Margin Stock (as applicable).
Mandatory Sales

Prior to the time that (x) the Issuer would acquire or receive an asset in connection with a workout or restructuring of a Collateral Obligation, or (y) any Collateral Obligation is modified in any manner, in each case, that would cause the Issuer to violate the U.S. Tax Guidelines, the Issuer shall sell the right to receive such asset, or the Collateral Obligation that is the subject of the workout, restructuring, or modification, unless the Issuer has received written advice of nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of such asset or Collateral Obligation, or that the modification of such Collateral Obligation, as the case may be, will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis.
Discretionary Sales

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may dispose of any Collateral Obligation (other than a Credit Improved Obligation, a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Equity Security or a Workout Obligation, each of which may only be sold in the circumstances provided above) at any time provided that:
(a) no Event of Default has occurred which is continuing;
(b) on and following the Effective Date, after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding of all Collateral Obligations sold as described in this paragraph during the preceding 12 calendar months (or, for the first twelve calendar months after the Effective Date, during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date of determination) is not greater than 30 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of such twelve calendar month period (or as of the Effective Date, as the case may be);
(c) either:
(i) during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager reasonably believes prior to such sale that it will be able to enter into one or more binding commitments to reinvest all or a portion of the proceeds of such sale in one or more additional Collateral Obligations within 60 calendar days after the settlement of such sale in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria (to the extent applicable); or
(ii) any time, either: (A) the Sale Proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation; or (B) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding of all Collateral Obligations (excluding the Collateral Obligation being sold but including, without duplication, the Sale Proceeds of such sale) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) plus, without duplication, the amounts on deposit in the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (including Eligible Investments therein) will be greater than (or equal to) the Reinvestment Target Par Balance (as defined below); and
(d) during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager uses all reasonable efforts to reinvest such Sale Proceeds within 90 Business Days of the settlement of such sale and in any case, prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period. In the event such Sale Proceeds are not reinvested before the Payment Date falling immediately after the end of such 90 Business Day period, such amounts shall only remain credited to the Principal Account, as applicable, for the purpose of reinvestment to the extent no payments are required to be made on such Payment Date in respect of a failure to satisfy any Coverage Test (to the extent applicable on such Payment Date).
For the purposes of determining the percentage of Collateral Obligations sold during any such period as discretionary sales in accordance with the foregoing, the amount of any Collateral Obligations sold will be reduced to the extent of any purchases of Collateral Obligations of the same obligor (which are pari passu or senior to such sold Collateral Obligation) made within 30 calendar days of such sale so long as any such Collateral Obligation was sold with the intention of purchasing a Collateral Obligation of the same obligor (which would be pari passu or senior to such sold Collateral Obligation); provided that for the purposes of such determination, Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds shall be deemed to be pari passu.
Sale of Collateral Prior to Maturity Date

If: (i) any redemption of the Rated Notes in whole is scheduled to occur prior to the Maturity Date; (ii) notification is received from the Trustee of enforcement of the security over the Collateral; or (iii) the Maturity Date occurs or is shortly to occur, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall (or in the case of (ii) if requested by the Trustee following the enforcement of such security), as far as practicable, arrange for liquidation of the Collateral in order to procure that the proceeds thereof are in immediately available funds by the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date or Maturity Date as applicable and sell all or part of the Portfolio, as applicable, in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement but without regard to the limitations set out in “Sale of Collateral Obligations” above or the Reinvestment Criteria (which will include any limitations or restrictions set out in the Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed).
Reinvestment of Collateral Obligations

“Reinvestment Criteria” means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under “During the Reinvestment Period” below and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. The Reinvestment Criteria shall not apply prior to the Effective Date or in the case of a Collateral Obligation which has been restructured on and following the point at which such restructuring has become binding on the holders thereof (whether or not such obligation would constitute a “Restructured Obligation”), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if a restructured obligation (whether or not constituting a “Restructured Obligation”) is subsequently sold by the Collateral Manager or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Scheduled Principal Proceeds are received in connection with such restructured obligation, any reinvestment of the Sale Proceeds, Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Scheduled Principal Proceeds (as applicable) shall be subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
During the Reinvestment Period

During the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, at its discretion, reinvest any Principal Proceeds in the purchase of Substitute Collateral Obligations provided that immediately after entering into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation and taking into account existing commitments, the criteria set out below, must be satisfied:
(a) to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge, no Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(b) following the Effective Date (or in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, the Determination Date preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if (other than with respect to the reinvestment of any proceeds received upon the sale of, or as a recovery on, any Defaulted Obligation) as calculated immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation the Principal Proceeds of which are being reinvested, any Coverage Test (to the extent applicable) was not satisfied, the coverage ratio relating to such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment than it was immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation;
(c) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Impaired Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased with such Sale Proceeds shall at least equal such Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) the sum of:
(A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligation) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “B(sf)”)); and
(B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments representing Principal Proceeds (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(d) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Improved Obligation, Scheduled Principal Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance immediately prior to the sale of the relevant Credit Improved Obligation (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its Market Value); or
(ii) the sum of:
(A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligation) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “B(sf)”)); and
(B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments representing Principal Proceeds (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(e) either: (i) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be satisfied; or (ii) if any of the Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests are not satisfied, such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the position immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation;
(f) the date on which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation occurs during the Reinvestment Period;
(g) with respect to the reinvestment of Sale Proceeds (other than Sale Proceeds from Credit Improved Obligations, Credit Impaired Obligations, Defaulted Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities) either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance immediately prior to the sale that generates such Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) after giving effect to such sale, the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “Bsf”) and excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Substitute Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations); and
(B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments representing Principal Proceeds (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)),
is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; and
(h) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the balance in the Principal Account after giving effect to
(A) all expected debits and credits in connection with such purchase and all other sales and purchases (as applicable) previously or simultaneously committed to, and (B) without duplication of amounts in the preceding paragraph (A), anticipated receipts of Principal Proceeds, would be a negative amount, the absolute value of such amount is not greater than 5 per cent. of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount as of the Measurement Date immediately preceding the trade date for such purchase,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has occurred during the Reinvestment Period but which settle after such date, the purchase of such Collateral Obligations shall be treated as a purchase made during the Reinvestment Period.
Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, only, may be reinvested by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in one or more Substitute Collateral Obligations, in each case provided that:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Obligations equals or exceeds, in the case of Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations, such Sale Proceeds;
(b) (i) in the case of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Obligations equals or exceeds the Aggregate Principal Balance of the related Collateral Obligations that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds, as the case may be or (ii) in the case of Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for such purpose, the Principal Balance of all Defaulted Obligations shall be the lower of their Moody’s Collateral Value and their S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “B(sf)”)) after giving effect to such purchases is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(c) either:
(i) such Substitute Collateral Obligations (which may include multiple acquisitions as part of a Trading Plan) have the same or a higher S&P Rating as the Collateral Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) for so long as any Notes rated by S&P are Outstanding, the S&P CDO SDR is no greater following such reinvestment;
(d) each Coverage Test is satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(e) either: (i) the Portfolio Profile Tests (other than Portfolio Profile Tests (h) and (i)) and the Collateral Quality Tests (other than the S&P CDO Monitor Test, the Weighted Average Life Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test) are satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (ii) if any such test was not satisfied immediately prior to such reinvestment, such test will be satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment or will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the results of such tests immediately prior to the sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation;
(f) to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such reinvestment;
(g) the Stated Maturity of each Substitute Collateral Obligation is the same as or earlier than the Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds;
(h) a Restricted Trading Period is not currently in effect;
(i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the balance in the Principal Account after giving effect to
(A) all expected debits and credits in connection with such purchase and all other sales and purchases (as applicable) previously or simultaneously committed to, and (B) without duplication of amounts in the preceding paragraph (A), anticipated receipts of Principal Proceeds, would be a negative amount, the
absolute value of such amount is not greater than 5 per cent. of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount as of the Measurement Date immediately preceding the trade date for such purchase;
(j) the Weighted Average Life Test is either: (i) if the Weighted Average Life Test was not satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (ii) if the Weighted Average Life Test was satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied or, if not satisfied, maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the result of such test immediately prior to such sale, repayment or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation;
(k) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test shall be satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(l) for so long as Moody’s assigns the rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, either: (i) if Portfolio Profile Test (h) was not satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (ii) if Portfolio Profile Test (h) was satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied or, if not satisfied, maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the result of such test immediately prior to such sale, repayment or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation; and
(m) for so long as S&P assigns the rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, either: (i) if Portfolio Profile Test (i) was not satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (ii) if Portfolio Profile Test (i) was satisfied on the last day of the Reinvestment Period, shall be satisfied or, if not satisfied, maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the result of such test immediately prior to such sale, repayment or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation.
Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above prior to the end of the Due Period in which such proceeds were received shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payment on the following Payment Date (subject as provided in the proviso at the end of this paragraph), save that the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Improved Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment but for no longer than the end of the following Due Period; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria are not satisfied as of the Payment Date next following receipt of such Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, all such funds shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and such funds shall be applied only in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payments.
Amendments to Stated Maturities of Collateral Obligations

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment:
(a) the Weighted Average Life Test is satisfied; or
(b) (i) such Maturity Amendment relates to an exchange or restructuring of a Defaulted Obligation (including, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager, to prevent a Collateral Obligation from becoming a Defaulted Obligation within three months); and
(ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations subject to Maturity Amendments to which the Collateral Manager has consented pursuant to this paragraph (b)(ii) would be less than, in aggregate, 10 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; or
(c) (i) in its commercially reasonable judgment, the Collateral Manager believes that the market value of the relevant Collateral Obligation following such Maturity Amendment will be greater than
the market value of the Collateral Obligation immediately prior to such Maturity Amendment; and
(ii) either (x) the Collateral Manager will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the amended Collateral Obligation within 30 Business Days of the date of amendment (or, if the Collateral Manager is unable to sell such amended Collateral Obligation within such period, such longer period as may be necessary in the reasonable commercial judgement of the Collateral Manager) or (y) the Controlling Class (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) has consented to the Collateral Manager retaining (rather than selling) such amended Collateral Obligation,
provided that not more than 20 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value (determined on the assumption of “an Initial Rated Note Rating” of “Bsf”)) shall consist of, together, the Aggregate Principal Balance of Long-Dated Restructured Obligations and Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) has voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment (each a “Long-Dated Maturity Date Obligation”).
If the Issuer or the Collateral Manager has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements of this section but the Stated Maturity has been extended, by way of scheme or arrangement or otherwise, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may (but shall not be required to) sell such Collateral Obligation provided that in any event the Collateral Manager shall dispose of such Collateral Obligation prior to the Maturity Date. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
“Maturity Amendment” means with respect to any Collateral Obligation, any waiver, modification, amendment or variance (including in relation to an exchange or restructuring of a Defaulted Obligation) that would extend the Stated Maturity of such Collateral Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, a waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Stated Maturity of the credit facility of which a Collateral Obligation is part, but would not extend the Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation held by the Issuer, does not constitute a Maturity Amendment.
Expiry of the Reinvestment Criteria Certification

Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Obligations.
Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test

If on any Determination Date falling on and after the Effective Date and prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Class E Par Value Ratio is less than 105.89 per cent., on the relevant Payment Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account, for the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations in an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph
(V) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments; and (b) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) to (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be met as of the relevant Determination Date after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (V) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, such amounts to be applied during the Reinvestment Period to purchase additional Collateral Obligations.
Designation for Reinvestment

After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds (the amount of all Principal Proceeds having been determined by the Collateral Administrator on each Determination Date and notified to the Collateral Manager) which the Collateral Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as
described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (a) Purchased Accrued Interest; (b) any interest received in respect of any Mezzanine Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Deferring Mezzanine Obligation other than Defaulted Mezzanine Excess Amounts; and
(c) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.
Accrued Interest

Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute Purchased Accrued Interest and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
Block Trades

The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Obligations on any day if such Collateral Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria, at the election of the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Obligation or a group of Collateral Obligations) identified by the Collateral Manager as such at the time (the “Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date”) when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a “Trading Plan”) may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the 20 Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the “Trading Plan Period”); provided that: (a) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value); (b) no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date; (c) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period; (d) if the Reinvestment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan, but are not satisfied upon the completion of the related Trading Plan, Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation is obtained with respect to the effectiveness of additional Trading Plans (it being understood that Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation shall only be required once following any failure of a Trading Plan); (e) no Trading Plan may be entered into if any of the Collateral Obligations which form part of such Trading Plan have Stated Maturities shorter than 12 months; and (f) no Trading Plan may be entered into if the differential between the shortest and the longest maturities of the related Collateral Obligations forming part of such Trading Plan exceeds three years; and provided further that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligations purchased at separate times for purposes of determining whether any particular Collateral Obligation is a Discount Obligation or a Swapped Non-Discount Obligation.
Eligible Investments

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than each Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account, the Collection Account or the Payment Account). For
the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time, purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Obligations being so purchased.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of Contributions and the balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time. Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest and/or principal payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations may be sold at any time and all Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or at any time required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test or Collateral Quality Tests.
Workout Obligations

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time, purchase Workout Obligations subject to and in accordance with the Conditions and the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement including the following limitations:
(i) the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Workout Obligations acquired with Principal Proceeds and held by the Issuer as of any date (i) during the first calendar year following the Issue Date, shall not exceed 2.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; (ii) during the first calendar quarter thereafter, shall not exceed 2.25 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; and (iii) during each calendar quarter thereafter, shall not exceed an amount equal to the limit applicable during the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus
0.25 per cent. of the Target Par Amount;
(ii) the cumulative aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Workout Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or after the Issue Date with Principal Proceeds (for the avoidance of doubt whether or not any such Workout Obligation continues to be held by the Issuer) shall not exceed 10.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount; and
(iii) the cumulative aggregate principal amount outstanding (and in the case of any obligation other than a debt obligation, the nominal value thereof as reasonably determined by the Collateral Manager) of all Workout Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or after the Issue Date with Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds (for the avoidance of doubt whether or not any such Workout Obligation continues to be held by the Issuer) shall not exceed 10.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Workout Obligations may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account, the Interest Account or the Principal Account at the relevant time, in each case subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.
Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account), the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account shall be comprised of all sums deposited in such account from time to time which will include: (i) interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account during the Reinvestment Period, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders, as a Collateral Enhancement Amount subject to the limits set out in the definition thereof; and (ii) the amount of any Collateral Manager Advance contributed by the Collateral Manager and deposited into the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed.
Workout Obligations may be sold at any time by the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, and all sale proceeds (and other Distributions) received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Interest Account or the Principal Account in each case subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.
For the avoidance of doubt, Workout Obligations shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and none of the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria or Restructured Obligation Criteria shall be required to be satisfied in connection with the purchase thereof, save that, in accordance with the definition thereof (i) Principal Proceeds Workout Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on any date on or after their date of acquisition shall, on and with effect from such date, be deemed to be Collateral Obligations for the purposes of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (and all associated provisions and definitions); and (ii) where sub-paragraph (i) does not apply, Principal Proceeds Workout Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria (other than the criteria set out at paragraphs (c), (f), (g), (i), (j), (m), (n), (v), (w), (z), (aa), (dd), (ee), (ff)) on any date on or after their date of acquisition shall, on and with effect from such date (and notwithstanding any definition or provision of these Conditions, excluding for the avoidance of doubt, proviso (i) above) at all times be deemed to be Defaulted Obligations for the purposes of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (and all associated provisions and definitions).
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may notify the Issuer in writing (which may be by way of email) no later than 10 Business Days following the acquisition thereof, as to whether or not any Workout Obligation purchased with Interest Proceeds or amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Conditions, is to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation (and if the Collateral Manager so notifies the Issuer that the relevant Workout Obligation (i) is to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation, then it shall be treated (irrevocably) as such; or (ii) is not to be treated as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation, then it shall (irrevocably) not be treated as such); provided that if the Collateral Manager does not so notify the Issuer within such timeframe, then the relevant Workout Obligation shall be treated (irrevocably) as a Principal Proceeds Workout Obligation.
Exercise of Warrants and Options

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may at any time, exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall, on behalf of the Issuer, instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment pursuant to a duly completed form of instruction.
Margin Stock

The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavours to sell any Collateral Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security, Collateral Enhancement Obligation or Workout Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.
Non-Euro Obligations

Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall from time to time be authorised to purchase, on behalf of the Issuer, Non-Euro Obligations provided that any such Non-Euro Obligation shall only constitute a Collateral Obligation that satisfies paragraph (b) of the Eligibility Criteria if the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, into an Asset Swap Transaction (which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Obligation) pursuant to which the currency risk arising from receipt of cash flows from such Non-Euro Obligations, including interest and principal payments, is hedged through the swapping of such cash flows for Euro payments to be made by an Asset Swap Counterparty. Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) shall be authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, but solely to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Asset Swap Transaction. Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation shall be required in relation to entry into each Asset Swap Transaction unless such Asset Swap Transaction is a Form Approved Asset Swap. See the “Hedging Arrangements” section of this Offering Circular.
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations.
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euros) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.
Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee or other ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof if any default by the obligor thereof in respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith occurs). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder.
Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the applicable Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations.
To the extent required, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a third party from time to time as collateral for any payment obligations of the Issuer in relation to a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, as applicable, including but not limited to reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt of an Issuer Order (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) the Trustee shall be deemed to have released such amounts from the security granted thereover pursuant to the Trust Deed.
Participations

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:
(a) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution will not exceed the individual and aggregate percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party or any guarantor thereof; and
(b) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions or any guarantor thereof, each having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating,
and for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Obligation.
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of:
(a) the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);
(b) the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or
(c) such other documentation provided such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as that set out in the Trust Deed.
Assignments

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Collateral Obligation is acquired by way of Assignment the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
Bivariate Risk Table

The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) and as referred to in “Portfolio Profile Tests” below and “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the Moody’s or S&P ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.

Eligible Investments – Principal Reductions
Subject to the standard of care required under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall monitor, on an on-going basis during each Due Period, all Eligible Investments that provide for Principal Reductions in accordance with their terms, in order to determine whether, in the Collateral Manager’s reasonable determination, the aggregate amount of anticipated Principal Reductions for the applicable Due Period will exceed the amount then on deposit in the Principal Reduction Reserve Account. If such a determination is made, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify the Collateral Administrator and shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, (i) dispose of such Eligible Investments, (ii) procure the transfer of funds from the Collateral Enhancement Account and/or the Contribution Account to the Principal Reduction Reserve Account and/or (iii) deposit the proceeds from the issue of additional Subordinated Notes in accordance with Condition 17
(Additional Issuances) into the Principal Reduction Reserve Account, in each case in accordance with the Conditions, to the extent necessary to ensure that the aggregate amount of anticipated Principal Reductions for the applicable Due Period no longer exceeds the amount then on deposit in the Principal Reduction Reserve Account.
The Collateral Manager shall, in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Conditions, as soon as reasonably practicable, procure that the Collateral Administrator shall transfer to the Principal Account funds standing to the credit of the Principal Reduction Reserve Account following the occurrence of a Principal Reduction in respect of an Eligible Investment held by the Issuer, in the amount of such Principal Reduction.
Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests

Measurement of Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Measurement Date (save as otherwise provided herein).
Substitute Collateral Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to purchase such Substitute Collateral Obligations but such purchase has not been settled shall nonetheless be deemed to have been purchased for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Obligations in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed. See “Reinvestment of Collateral Obligations” above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio to meet the requirements of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Obligation from being a Collateral Obligation.
Portfolio Profile Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) not less than 90 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Loans or Secured Senior Bonds (which term, for the purposes of this paragraph (a), shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date);
(b) not less than 70 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Loans (which term, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date);
(c) not more than 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds;
(d) with respect to any Collateral Obligations, not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall be the obligation of any single Obligor, provided that up to 5 Obligors may each represent up to 3 per cent.;
(e) with respect to Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds, not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall be the obligation of any single Obligor, provided that up to 3 Obligors may each represent up to 3 per cent.;
(f) with respect to Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds not more than 1.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall be the obligation of
any single Obligor, provided that up to 3 Obligors (including any exceptions pursuant to Portfolio Profile Test (e) above) may each represent up to 2 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance;
(g) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Participations;
(h) for so long as Moody’s assigns a rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, not more than
7.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Moody’s Caa Obligations;
(i) not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are S&P CCC Obligations;
(j) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations;
(k) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Current Pay Obligations;
(l) not more than 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Unfunded Amounts or Funded Amounts under Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations;
(m) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Corporate Rescue Loans and not more than 2 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Corporate Rescue Loans issued by a single Obligor;
(n) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are PIK Securities, provided that such PIK Securities are Restructured Obligations;
(o) not more than 40 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Cov-Lite Loans;
(p) for so long as Moody’s assigns a rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, not more than 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations whose Moody’s Rating is derived from an S&P rating;
(q) for so long as Moody’s assigns a rating in respect of an Outstanding Class of Rated Notes, not more than 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Obligors who are Domiciled in countries or jurisdictions with a Moody’s local-currency country bond ceiling between “A1” and “A3”, unless Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s is obtained;
(r) not more than 20 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of Obligors who are Domiciled in countries or jurisdictions with a country rating below “A-” by S&P unless Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P is obtained;
(s) not more than 17.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations comprising any one S&P Industry Classification Group;
(t) the limits set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the ratings of Selling Institutions shall be satisfied;
(u) not more than 25 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Non-Euro Obligations;
(v) not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations which are Bridge Loans; and
(w) not more than 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance shall consist of obligations issued by Obligors each of which has a total current indebtedness of equal to or more than €200,000,000 and less than €250,000,000 (or its equivalent in another currency).
The percentage requirements applicable to different types of Collateral Obligations specified in the Portfolio Profile Tests shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of such type of Collateral Obligations. Obligations for which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered
into binding commitments to purchase but have not yet settled shall be included for the purposes of calculating the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Obligations in the calculation of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed.
“Bridge Loan” shall mean any Collateral Obligation that: (a) is incurred in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a person, restructuring or similar transaction; (b) by its terms, is required to be repaid within one year of the incurrence thereof with proceeds from additional borrowings or other refinancings (provided, however, that any additional borrowing or refinancing having a term of more than one year may be included as a Bridge Loan if one or more financial institutions shall have provided the obligor with a binding written commitment to provide the same); and (c) prior to its purchase by the Issuer, has a Moody’s Rating and an S&P Rating, or if the Bridge Loan is not rated by Moody’s and S&P, Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained.
“S&P Industry Classification Group” means an industry classification group set out in the table below or as otherwise modified, amended or replaced by S&P from time to time:

The percentage requirements applicable to different types of Collateral Obligations specified in the Portfolio Profile Tests shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of such type of Collateral Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations
Collateral Quality Tests

The Collateral Quality Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) so long as any of the Rated Notes rated by Moody’s are Outstanding:
(i) the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test (from the Effective Date and until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only);
(ii) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test;
(iii) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test; and
(iv) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test;
(b) so long as any Notes rated by S&P are Outstanding (from the Effective Date and until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only), the S&P CDO Monitor Test; and
(c) so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding, the Weighted Average Life Test, each as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Obligations which are to constitute Collateral Obligations for which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to purchase but have not yet settled shall be included for the purposes of calculating the Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Obligations in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed.
If the Aggregate Collateral Balance is higher than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance, the Collateral Manager will have the ability to exclude Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance equal to the excess of the Aggregate Collateral Balance over the Reinvestment Target Par Balance from each Collateral Quality Test
provided that the Aggregate Collateral Balance of such Collateral Obligations so excluded up to 0.75 per cent. of the Reinvestment Target Par Balance (such Collateral Obligations, “Excess Par Collateral Obligations”). The Collateral Manager shall, on any Measurement Date, designate Excess Par Collateral Obligations for the purposes of the Collateral Quality Tests being tested on such Measurement Date, by written notice to the Collateral Administrator (which notice may be by e-mail) and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Collateral Obligation is designated as an Excess Par Collateral Obligation, any such Excess Par Collateral Obligation shall be excluded from all Collateral Quality Tests on such Measurement Date. If the Collateral Manager designates Excess Par Collateral Obligations on a Measurement Date in accordance with the foregoing, such Collateral Obligations shall remain as Excess Par Collateral Obligations until the Collateral Manager notifies the Collateral Administrator (which notice may be by e-mail), on any following Measurement Date, that any alternative Collateral Obligations shall constitute the Excess Par Collateral Obligations.
Moody’s Test Matrix

Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set forth in the matrix to be set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (or any other replacement matrix (or portion thereof) subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s) (the “Moody’s Test Matrix”) shall be applicable for purposes of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. For any given case:
(a) the applicable column for performing the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in which the elected case is set out;
(b) the applicable row and column for performing the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the row and column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns, as applicable, in which the elected case is set out); and
(c) the applicable row for performing the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows, as applicable) in which the elected test is set out.
On the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will be required to elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter on ten Business Days’ notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and Moody’s, the Collateral Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test applicable to the case to which the Collateral Manager desires to change are satisfied or, in the case of any tests that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Collateral Manager be obliged to elect to have a different case apply.

The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test

The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result up to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):
(a) an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;
(b) a “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event
have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;
(d) an “Aggregate Geographically Based Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each Geographically Based Industry Group by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the same Geographically Based Industry Group; (or such other Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time);
(e) a “Geographically Based Industry Group” means:
(i) in respect of local industries, those Obligors which are classified under the same Moody’s industry group in the Moody’s industrial classification and which are incorporated or domiciled in the same region; or
(ii) in respect of global industries, those Obligors which are classified under the same Moody’s industry group in the Moody’s industrial classification,
provided that in respect of industry groups, global, local and regional classifications, such classifications as published by Moody’s from time to time are used; and
(f) an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Geographically Based Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Geographically Based Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.
For the purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.

The Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test

The “Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor of the Collateral Obligations as at such Measurement Date is equal to or less than the sum of (i) the number set forth in the Moody’s Test Matrix at the intersection of the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)), (acting on behalf of the Issuer) as at such Measurement Date plus (ii) the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment, provided, however, that the sum of (i) and (ii) may not exceed 3900.
The “Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor” is determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation, excluding Defaulted Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities, by its Moody’s Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balances of all such Collateral Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities, and rounding the result up to the nearest whole number.
The “Moody’s Rating Factor” relating to any Collateral Obligation is the number set forth in the table below opposite the Moody’s Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Obligation.

“Weighted Average Life” is, as of any Measurement Date with respect to all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations, the number of years (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth thereof) following such date obtained by summing the products obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Life at such time of each such Collateral Obligation by (b) the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation and dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance at such time of all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations.
Rating Definitions

Moody’s Ratings Definitions

“Assigned Moody’s Rating” means the monitored publicly available rating or the unpublished monitored loan rating or the credit estimate expressly assigned to a debt obligation (or facility) by Moody’s; provided that, so long as the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) applies for a new estimated rating, or renewal of an estimated rating, in a timely manner and provides the information required to obtain such estimate or renewal, as applicable, then pending receipt of such estimate or renewal, as applicable, (A) in the case of a request for a new estimated rating, (i) for a period of 90 days, such debt obligation will have a Moody’s Rating of “B2” for purposes of this definition if the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that the Collateral Manager believes that such estimated rating will be at least “B2” and (ii) thereafter, such debt obligation will have a Moody’s Rating of “Caa3” or (B) in the case of a request for a renewal of an estimated rating following a material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Obligor or a specified amendment, the Issuer will continue using the previous estimated rating assigned by Moody’s until such time as (x) Moody’s renews such estimated rating or assigns a new estimated rating for such debt obligation and (y) the criteria specified in clause (A) in connection with an annual request for a renewal of an estimated rating becomes applicable in respect of such debt obligation.

“S&P Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if there is an S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer of such Collateral Obligation by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Collateral Obligation (in a form that satisfies the then current S&P guarantee criteria), then the S&P Rating shall be such rating (regardless of whether there is a published rating by S&P on the Collateral Obligations of such issuer held by the Issuer, provided that private ratings (that is, ratings provided at the request of the Obligor) may be used for purposes of this definition if the related Obligor has consented to the disclosure thereof and a copy of such consent has been provided to S&P);
(b) if there is no S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer or guarantor by S&P but,
(i) there is a senior secured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be one sub-category below such rating;
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, but there is a senior unsecured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall equal such rating; and

(c) with respect to any Collateral Obligation that is a Current Pay Obligation, the S&P Rating applicable to such obligation shall be the issue level rating thereof and if there is no such issue level rating, the S&P Rating applicable to such Current Pay Obligation shall be “CCC-”;
(d) with respect to any Collateral Obligation that is a Corporate Rescue Loan:
(i) falling within paragraph (a) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if (x) S&P has assigned a public rating to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate
Rescue Loan shall be such public rating or (y) if no public rating is assigned by S&P to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating shall be such credit estimate; or
(ii) falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned an S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate; or
(iii) (upon application by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) to S&P for a credit estimate, the applicable Corporate Rescue Loan shall be deemed to have an S&P Rating of “D”; and
(e) if there is not a rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be determined (other than in the case of any Corporate Rescue Loan) pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (iv) below:
(i) if an obligation of the issuer is not a Corporate Rescue Loan and is publicly rated by Moody’s, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing the S&P Rating set forth above except that, the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (1) one sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Baa3” or higher and (2) two sub-categories below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Ba1” or lower; provided that in each case, the S&P Rating will be a further sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating of the applicable obligation if the relevant Moody’s rating is on “credit watch negative” by Moody’s; provided, further, that the S&P Rating shall not be determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) in respect of any Collateral Obligation, if doing so would result in the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations for which S&P Ratings have been determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) exceeding 15 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance at the relevant time (where, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be equal to its S&P Collateral Value), whereupon the S&P Rating of any Collateral Obligations comprising such excess shall be “CCC-” provided that (i) neither the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy, reorganisation or similar proceedings; and (ii) the Collateral Obligation is current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects such Collateral Obligation to remain current (for the purposes of this paragraph (e)(i), the Collateral Obligations whose S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) with the lowest S&P Collateral Value (expressed as a percentage of the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation as of the relevant date of determination) shall be determined to comprise such excess);
(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by S&P, and in connection therewith, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer or the issuer of such Collateral Obligation shall, prior to or within 30 days after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, apply (and concurrently submit all available information in respect of such application) to S&P for a credit estimate which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, if such information is submitted within such 30 day period, then, for a period of up to 90 days after acquisition of such Collateral Obligation by the Issuer and pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating as determined by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if (A) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and that the S&P Rating, will be at least equal to such rating and (B) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations subject to an S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager in accordance with (A) does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for such purpose the Principal Balance of all Defaulted Obligations shall be their S&P Collateral Value); provided, further, that: (x) if such information is not submitted within such 30 day period and (y) following the end of the 90-day period set forth above, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-”; unless, in the case of clause (y) above, during such 90-day period, the Collateral Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided, further, that; if the Collateral Obligation has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a credit estimate in respect of such Collateral Obligation, the S&P Rating in respect thereof shall be “CCC-” pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, and S&P may elect
not to provide such estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided, further, that such credit estimate shall expire 12 months after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, following which such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-” unless, during such 12 month period, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) applies for renewal thereof in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in which case such credit estimate shall continue to be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation; provided, further, that such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall expire on the next succeeding 12-month anniversary of the date of the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation and (when renewed annually in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) on each 12-month anniversary thereafter;
(iii) with respect to a Collateral Obligation that is not a Defaulted Obligation, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation will at the election of the Issuer (at the direction of the Collateral Manager) be “CCC-”; provided that (i) neither the issuer of such Collateral Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings; (ii) the issuer has not defaulted on any payment obligation in respect of any debt security or other obligation of the issuer at any time within the two year period ending on such date of determination and all such debt securities and other obligations of the issuer are current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects them to remain current; and (iii) the Collateral Obligation is current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects it to remain current; and
(iv) with respect to Collateral Obligations whose rating input cannot be determined using any of the steps described in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) above, then the S&P Rating is “CC,”
provided that for purposes of the determination of the S&P Rating, (x) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch positive” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub- category above such assigned rating, (y) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch negative” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating and (z) only ratings assigned on the basis of ongoing surveillance will be applicable for the purposes of this definition.
“S&P Issuer Credit Rating” means, in respect of a Collateral Obligation, a publicly available issuer credit rating by S&P in respect of the Obligor thereof.
The Coverage Tests
The Coverage Tests will consist of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class E Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test and the Class D Interest Coverage Test. The Coverage Tests will be used primarily to determine whether interest may be paid on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and whether Principal Proceeds may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations. Each of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class D Interest Coverage Test and the Class E Par Value Test shall apply on a Measurement Date (a) on and after the Effective Date in the case of the Par Value Tests, and (b) on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date following the Effective Date in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests and shall be satisfied on a Measurement Date if the corresponding Par Value Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio (as the case may be) is at least equal to the percentage specified in the table below in relation to that Coverage Test.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
The following description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement

Fees
As compensation for the performance of its investment management services under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will receive from the Issuer, in arrear on each Payment Date, the Senior Collateral Management Fee, which will be payable senior to the Notes, but subordinated to certain fees and expenses of the Issuer, in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Collateral Manager will also receive from the Issuer, in arrear on each Payment Date, the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee, which will be payable subordinated to the Notes, in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In addition to the Senior Collateral Management Fee and the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee, the Collateral Manager will receive the Incentive Collateral Management Fee, if the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met, payable out of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Each of the Senior Collateral Management Fee and the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee shall be calculated semi-annually following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and quarterly at all other times, in each case, based upon the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Due Period divided by 360.
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Collateral Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Collateral Management Fee equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Subordinated Collateral Management Fee equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.
The Collateral Manager may elect to defer any Senior Collateral Management Fees and any Subordinated Collateral Management Fees. Any amounts so deferred shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Any due and unpaid Collateral Management Fees including Deferred Senior Collateral Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Collateral Management Amounts shall not accrue any interest.
Cross Transactions, Principal Transactions and Conflicts of Interest
The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates and/or any fund or account for which the Collateral Manager or any Affiliate of the Collateral Manager serves as investment adviser or collateral manager may at certain times seek to purchase or sell investments from or to the Issuer as principal. Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, at its option and sole discretion, may effect principal transactions between such entities. In addition, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates will be authorised to engage in certain “cross” and/or “principal” transactions between a Collateral Manager Related Person and the Issuer if permitted in accordance with applicable policies and procedures, and in any case by applicable law, as further described in “Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Collateral Manager”.
In the event that any Originated Asset (as defined in the section entitled “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements”) fails to meet the Eligibility Criteria within 15 Business Days of the date upon which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation, the Issuer shall have the right to require the Collateral Manager to purchase from it the relevant Originated Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Originated Asset in accordance with the terms summarised in the section entitled “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations”.
Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer will acknowledge and agree, among other things, that (i) the Collateral Manager engages in other business and furnishes investment management and
advisory services to other funds which may differ from those provided by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer, (ii) the Collateral Manager may make recommendations or effect transactions which may differ from those effected with respect to the loans and securities included in the Collateral, (iii) the Collateral Manager may, from time to time, or may cause or direct another account managed by the Collateral Manager to buy or sell, or recommend to the account the buying or selling of, securities of the same or a different kind or class of the same issuer, as the Collateral Manager directs be purchased or sold on behalf of the Issuer and (iv) in certain circumstances, the interests of the Issuer and/or the Noteholders with respect to matters as to which the Collateral Manager is advising the Issuer may conflict with the interests of the Collateral Manager.
By purchasing a Note, a holder shall be deemed to have consented to the procedures described herein relating to cross transactions, principal transactions and to the conflicts of interest described herein. The Collateral Manager or its Affiliates may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both parties to any principal transaction or cross transactions. See “Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Collateral Manager”.
The Collateral Manager may participate in creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or work-out of issuers of Collateral Obligations. In such circumstances, the Collateral Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or any Collateral Manager Related Person that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Obligations.
Standard of Care of the Collateral Manager
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will agree with the Issuer that it will perform its obligations, duties and discretions under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, with reasonable care using a degree of skill not less than that which the Collateral Manager exercises (and in any event not less than the degree of care and skill exercised by other collateral managers of recognised standing) with respect to comparable assets that it manages for itself and others having similar investment objectives and restrictions (the “Standard of Care”).
Additionally, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains provisions which require (subject to the Standard of Care), that the Collateral Manager shall not take any action on behalf of the Issuer which would cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or become otherwise subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax on a net income basis, subject to further conditions detailed in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement including adhering to specific U.S. Tax Guidelines (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) and/or relying on external tax advice as contemplated therein.
The Collateral Manager is authorised to act on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Collateral Manager’s duties and authority to act as Collateral Manager are limited to the duties and authority specifically provided for in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. In particular, the Collateral Manager shall not assume the rights or obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed or any other document to which the Issuer is a party.
Responsibilities of the Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager will have no responsibility under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and, subject to the Standard of Care described above:
(a) shall not be responsible for any action it takes, on behalf of the Issuer, in compliance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement;
(b) shall not be responsible for any action or inaction by the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee in following or declining to follow any direction, advice, recommendation or instruction of the Collateral Manager;
(c) does not assume any fiduciary duty or responsibility with regard to the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholder or any other person;
(d) does not guarantee or otherwise assume any responsibility for the performance of the Notes, the Portfolio, any Collateral Obligation or the performance by any third party of any contract entered into on behalf of
the Issuer or, except as expressly set forth under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, any obligation of any other party;
(e) shall not incur any liability in acting upon any publicly available information published or provided to it in relation to the Collateral in the absence of actual knowledge of the Collateral Manager to the contrary, save for manifest error;
(f) shall incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, statement, notice, resolution, request, direction, consent, order, report, opinion, bond or other document, paper or data reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be properly executed or signed or originated by the proper party or parties;
(g) shall be entitled to rely, in the absence of manifest error of which the Collateral Manager is actually aware (without having made further enquiry or investigation), upon the accuracy and completeness of notices and other information supplied by the Collateral Administrator; and
(h) shall not incur any liability in, and shall bear no responsibility for, acting or relying upon information provided to it in respect of any Collateral Obligation or related Underlying Instrument by (x) any Obligor or issuer thereof (or any officer thereof), (y) any investment bank providing analytical service in relation thereto, or (z) any investment bank or other entity originating or arranging the syndication of such Collateral Obligation, in each case save in the case of manifest error.
In situations where a conflict of interest arises between the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, neither the Collateral Manager nor any of its clients, partners, members or their employees and their Affiliates has any duty to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any particular investment opportunity to the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager, as well as its directors, employees, officers, shareholders and agents, shall not be liable (whether directly or indirectly, in contract or in tort or otherwise) to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other person for losses, claims, damages, judgments, interest on judgments, assessments, costs, fees, charges, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities (including, without limitation, in respect of taxes, duties, levies, imposts and other charges and all properly incurred legal fees and disbursements incurred in defending or disputing any of the foregoing and including any irrecoverable VAT or similar tax charged or chargeable in respect thereof) (collectively “Liabilities”) incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other person that arise out of or in connection with the performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement provided that nothing shall relieve the Collateral Manager from liability to the Issuer for Liabilities it may incur:
(a) by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (where gross negligence shall be given its meaning under New York law) of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party; or
(b) with respect to the information concerning the Collateral Manager provided in writing to the Issuer by the Collateral Manager expressly for inclusion in the Preliminary Offering Circulars (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) and this Offering Circular, such information containing any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
each an “Collateral Manager Breach”. The Collateral Manager shall indemnify the Issuer in respect of any Collateral Manager Breaches subject to and in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Collateral Manager be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits) even if the Collateral Manager has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
Subject to the Standard of Care specified above, the Collateral Manager (any Affiliates of the Collateral Manager, and their shareholders, directors, officers, members, attorneys, advisors, agents and employees) will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer in relation, inter alia, to the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, which will be payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (including any pecuniary sanctions to which the Collateral Manager became liable pursuant
to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation). The Issuer shall not be liable for any costs incurred by the Collateral Manager in respect of compliance by the Collateral Manager with the U.S. Retention Regulations (to the extent applicable).
Resignation of the Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager may resign, subject to the appointment of a successor collateral manager, with or without cause upon at least 90 calendar days’ prior written notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Noteholders (delivery of such notice to the Noteholders to be given by the Issuer in accordance with the Conditions), any Hedge Counterparty and each Rating Agency. The Collateral Manager may resign its appointment upon shorter notice whether or not a successor collateral manager has been appointed where there is a change in law or the application of any applicable law which makes it illegal for the Collateral Manager to carry on its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Collateral Manager Tax Event
The Collateral Manager may be removed by the Issuer (regardless of whether or not a successor collateral manager has been appointed) if it has not changed the location from which it provides its investment management services under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or otherwise remedied or eliminated the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Tax Event, in each case, within 90 calendar days of the date that the Collateral Manager first becomes aware of a Collateral Manager Tax Event (where “Collateral Manager Tax Event” means that the Issuer has become subject either to any:
(a) French tax liability; or
(b) U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (or there being a substantial likelihood that the Issuer will become subject such U.S. federal income tax),
where the amount of such tax liability is in a sufficient amount such that the Class E Par Value Test would not be satisfied if calculated assuming payment by the Issuer of such tax liability) (in each case, provided that such 90 calendar day period shall be extended by a further 90 calendar days if the Collateral Manager has notified the Issuer and the Trustee in writing before the end of the first 90 calendar day period that (A) it expects to have changed the place from which it provides its investment management services under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement so as to remedy or eliminate such Collateral Manager Tax Event or
(B) that it is otherwise able to remedy or eliminate the circumstances giving rise to such Collateral Manager Tax Event).
Removal for Cause
The Collateral Manager may, subject to the appointment of a successor Collateral Manager in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, be removed for Cause upon at least 30 calendar days’ prior written notice:
(a) by the Issuer at its discretion; and
(b) by the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed in writing by the holders of:
(i) the Subordinated Notes, acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution; or
(ii) the Controlling Class, acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, excluding any Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes (if applicable to the then Controlling Class),
in each case excluding any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager,
provided that notice of such removal shall have been given to the holders of each Class of the Notes by the Issuer or the Trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with the Conditions.
For the purposes of determining “Cause” with respect to termination of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement such term shall mean any one of the following events:
(a) that the Collateral Manager wilfully violated a material provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document applicable to it (unrelated to the economic performance of the Collateral Obligations, for the avoidance of doubt, (it being understood that the failure to meet any Coverage Tests, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, any Portfolio Profile Tests or any Collateral Quality Tests shall not of itself constitute a breach by the Collateral Manager under this paragraph (a));
(b) that the Collateral Manager breached in any respect any provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as is applicable to it (other than as specified in paragraph (a) above) which breach:
(i) has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or the interests of the Noteholders of any Class; and
(ii) if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 calendar days of the Collateral Manager becoming aware thereof or the Collateral Manager’s receipt of written notice of such breach from the Issuer or the Trustee unless, if capable of being cured, the Collateral Manager has commenced the taking of action within such 30 calendar day period to the satisfaction of the Trustee (acting reasonably) to remedy such breach and does in fact remedy such breach within 60 calendar days after the Collateral Manager becoming aware of such breach or the Collateral Manager receiving written notice of such breach from the Issuer or the Trustee;
(c) the failure of any representation, warranty, certification or statement made or delivered by the Collateral Manager in or pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document to be correct when made and such failure:
(i) has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or interests of the Noteholders of any Class; and
(ii) is not remedied within 30 calendar days after the Collateral Manager becomes aware of, or its receipt of written notice from the Issuer or the Trustee of, such failure;
(d) the Collateral Manager is wound up or dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger where a successor collateral manager succeeds the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and is bound by the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents applicable to the Collateral Manager), or there is appointed over it or a substantial part of its assets a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer;
(e) the Collateral Manager:
(i) ceases to be able to, or admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts as they become due and payable, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of, or enters into any composition or arrangement with, its creditors generally;
(ii) applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the appointment of a receiver, administrator, trustee, assignee, custodian, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Collateral Manager or of any substantial part of its properties or assets, or authorises such an application or consent, or proceedings seeking such appointment are commenced against the Collateral Manager without such authorisation, consent or application and either continue undismissed for 60 calendar days or any such appointment is ordered by a court or regulatory body having jurisdiction;
(iii) authorises or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the application of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, readjustment of debt, insolvency, dissolution, or similar law, or authorises such application or consent, or proceedings to such end are instituted against the Collateral Manager without such authorisation, application or consent and remain undismissed for 60 calendar days or result in adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or the issuance of an order for relief; or
(iv) permits or suffers all or any substantial part of its properties or assets to be sequestered or attached by court order and the order (if contested in good faith) remains undismissed for 60 calendar days;
(f) the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Condition 10(a)(i) or 10(a)(ii) (Events of Default) that has not been cured within any applicable grace period and that arises from a breach of the Collateral Manager’s duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (it being understood that an act or omission of the Collateral Manager based on its good faith interpretation of the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed, will not constitute a breach for the purposes of this paragraph (f)); and
(g) the occurrence of an act by the Collateral Manager (or any senior officer of the Collateral Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or its other investment management activities, or the Collateral Manager (or any senior officer of the Collateral Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) being found guilty of having committed a criminal offence materially related to the management of investments similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral, unless any such senior officer of the Collateral Manager has, within 30 calendar days after such occurrence, been removed from performing work in fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, if any of the events specified in paragraphs (a) to (g) (inclusive) occurs, the Collateral Manager shall, upon becoming aware of the same, be required to give prompt written notice thereof to the Issuer (who shall promptly, upon receipt of the same, deliver notice to the Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions), the Trustee, the Rating Agencies and any Hedge Counterparty.
No Voting Rights
Any Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes shall not:
(a) have any voting rights in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution; or
(b) be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager (such reference shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, any Collateral Manager Related Person who is not the Collateral Manager) shall not:
(a) have any voting rights in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution; or
(b) be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.
Delegation, Assignment or Transfer
The Collateral Manager, without the prior consent of the Issuer, any Noteholder or the Trustee, may employ third parties, including its Affiliates, to render asset management services (including investment advice) and assistance in connection with its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, provided that in each case any such party has the required regulatory capacity to provide such services to the Issuer and provided that in each case such appointment will not cause the Issuer to become subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in Collateral Management Fees becoming subject to VAT or otherwise cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. In such event, the Collateral Manager shall not be relieved of any of its duties or liabilities under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement regardless of the performance of any services by third parties and shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses payable to any such third party except to the extent such expenses are payable by the Issuer under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager may not assign or transfer its material rights or material responsibilities under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement without the written consent of:
(a) the Issuer;
(b) either:
(i) the holders of the Rated Notes, acting by Ordinary Resolution, voting together as a single class; or
(ii) the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution,
in each case excluding any Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes (if applicable to the then Controlling Class); and
(c) the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution,
in each case excluding any Notes held by the Collateral Manager, and subject to receipt by the Issuer of a Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation with respect to such assignment or transfer and provided that such assignee or transferee has the required regulatory capacity to provide the services provided under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to the Issuer provided further that, to the extent permitted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, such consent and Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation shall not be required in the case of any assignment to a Permitted Assignee (as defined below); provided further that, if such transferee or assignee is to be the relevant retention party for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the appointment of such transferee or assignee is permitted under and contemplated by the Risk Retention Letter, permitted under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and would not cause the transactions described in this Offering Circular or the Collateral Manager to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
A “Permitted Assignee,” for the purposes of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, means an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager that certifies in writing (upon which certification the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Trustee and the Issuer that it:
(a) is legally qualified and has the regulatory capacity to act as collateral manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement;
(b) employs (directly or indirectly) the principal personnel performing the duties required under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (or persons of similar expertise) prior to such assignment;
(c) will not, as a consequence of its appointment, cause either of the Issuer or the Collateral to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act;
(d) will not, as a consequence of its appointment and/or conduct, cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in additional VAT or similar tax or any other material adverse tax becoming payable by the Issuer (whether to a tax authority or any counterparty); and
(e) if the Retention is to be transferred, such transfer would not result in a Retention Event.
The Issuer may not assign its rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement without the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the holders of each Class of Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution, each voting as a separate class, and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation and to such transferee or delegate having the required regulatory capacity, except in the case of an assignment by the Issuer: (a) to an entity that is a successor to the Issuer permitted under the Trust Deed; or (b) to the Trustee.
Appointment of Successor
Upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Collateral Manager to carry on its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and except as provided for under a Collateral Manager Tax Event as described above), the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The successor collateral manager will be selected by the Issuer subject to:
(a) the approval of the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution (excluding any Notes held by the Collateral Manager);
(b) the successor collateral manager demonstrating an ability to professionally and competently perform duties similar to those imposed upon the Collateral Manager pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and has a substantially similar (or better) level of experience;
(c) for so long as the Rated Notes are outstanding, the holders of the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) do not object within 30 calendar days after the giving of notice thereof in accordance with the Conditions of such proposed selection by the Issuer (excluding any Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and any Notes held by the Collateral Manager);
(d) the appointment of which will not cause either of the Issuer or the Portfolio to be required to be registered under the Investment Company Act;
(e) receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation;
(f) if it is to be the relevant retention party for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements, the transfer of the Retention to such entity:
(i) is permitted under and contemplated by the Risk Retention Letter;
(ii) permitted under the EU Retention Requirements; and
(iii) would not cause the transactions described in this Offering Circular or the Collateral Manager to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention Requirements;
(g) such successor collateral manager being legally qualified and having the requisite regulatory capacity (including Irish regulatory capacity to provide investment management services to Irish counterparties as a matter of the laws of Ireland) to act as collateral manager as successor to the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and in the other relevant Transaction Documents in the assumption of all of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and in the other relevant Transaction Documents;
(h) the appointment and/or conduct of such successor collateral manager will not (i) cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (iii) result in the Collateral Management Fees becoming subject to VAT or (iv) otherwise cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer; and
(i) the appointment of such successor collateral manager not requiring the Issuer, its officers or Directors, the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates to register as a CPO or CTA with the CFTC and become a member of the NFA.
If the holders of Subordinated Notes do not approve the successor collateral manager pursuant to paragraph (a) above, or the Controlling Class object to the Issuer’s selection of successor collateral manager pursuant to paragraph (c) above, then the Issuer may propose an alternative successor collateral manager. If no successor collateral manager has been appointed within 120 calendar days or if the Collateral Manager is required to resign as a result of illegality or due to a Collateral Manager Tax Event, the Issuer (subject to the approval of the Controlling Class, acting by Ordinary Resolution), shall appoint a successor collateral manager which satisfies the criteria specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation.
Upon Notice of Removal or Resignation of the Collateral Manager
If the Collateral Manager has received notice that it will be removed or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor collateral manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager:
(a) will not acquire on behalf of the Issuer any Collateral Obligations (except for trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation);
(b) will only execute sales of Margin Stock, Credit Impaired Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).
Any such resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager or termination of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement shall be without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention for so long as the Collateral Manager is also the Retention Holder (unless the same have been validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the Risk Retention Letter).
Termination and Resignation of Appointment of the Collateral Administrator
Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Administrator may be removed: (a) without cause at any time upon at least 90 calendar days’ prior written notice by the Issuer at its discretion or the Trustee if so directed by the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution and subject to the Trustee being secured and/or indemnified and/or prefunded to its satisfaction; or (b) with cause upon at least 10 calendar days’ prior written notice by the Issuer at its discretion or the Trustee if so directed by the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and subject to the Trustee being secured and/or indemnified and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. In addition, the Collateral Administrator may also resign its appointment without cause on at least 45 calendar days’ prior written notice and with cause upon at least 10 calendar days’ prior written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager. No resignation or removal of the Collateral Administrator will be effective until a successor collateral administrator has been appointed pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS
The following is a summary of the principal terms of the hedging arrangements to be entered into by the Issuer on either or about the Issue Date and/or thereafter. The following is a summary only and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive description of the detailed provisions of such documents (copies of which are available from the registered office of the Issuer). The following is a general description of the Hedge Agreements. Any Hedge Agreement may include terms which vary from the descriptions set out below.

Hedge Agreements
The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) may enter into Hedge Agreements, subject to the Issuer obtaining legal advice in respect of such Hedge Agreement from reputable international legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not require the Issuer, its Directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates to register with the CFTC and to become a member of the NFA with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA. The Issuer will obtain Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless such arrangements are documented by way of a Form Approved Hedge Agreement.
Form Approved Hedge Agreements
If a Rating Agency announces that the rating criteria applicable to Hedge Agreements has been modified such that a Hedge Agreement no longer constitutes a Form Approved Hedge Agreement then the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf shall seek approval of a new form of hedge agreement from the relevant Rating Agencies.
Currency Hedging Arrangements

Asset Swap Agreements

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase Non-Euro Obligations provided that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, into an Asset Swap Transaction which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Obligation (to become effective on or before the settlement date of such Collateral Obligation) with an Asset Swap Counterparty (which satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents) pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made to fund the Issuer’s acquisition of the related Non-Euro Obligation and the final and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.
Transactions entered into under an Asset Swap Agreement are documented in confirmations to such Asset Swap Agreement. Each transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to an Asset Swap Agreement (each an “Asset Swap Transaction”). An Asset Swap Transaction, if entered into, will be:
(a) used to hedge the currency (and if applicable, interest rate) mismatch between the Notes and any Non-
Euro Obligations and for no other purpose; and
(b) other than in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof.
Further, each Asset Swap Counterparty will be required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement (taking into account any guarantor thereof) and must have the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents. No Asset Swap Transaction may be entered into if, at the time of entry into such transaction, there is a withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax required in respect of any payments by either party to such Asset Swap Transaction. The Collateral Manager shall be required to terminate any Asset Swap Transaction at the time it sells an Asset Swap Obligation. Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms, resulting in either (a) the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Asset Swap Obligation (or the par value thereof) from the Issuer (which shall be funded outside the Priorities of Payment from the Asset Swap Account) and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition thereof) to the Issuer or (b) the Issuer retaining the proceeds of sale of the Asset Swap Obligation
(which shall be converted into Euro and paid into the Principal Account in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes) net of any payments due to the Asset Swap Counterparty in connection with the termination of the Asset Swap Transaction in such circumstances (which the Issuer shall pay to the Asset Swap Counterparty on the date such payment is due in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement). Furthermore, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Asset Swap Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, in which case any Asset Swap Termination Payment would be paid in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be returned to an Asset Swap Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payment in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement).
If, following the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes, the Asset Swap Counterparty elects not to early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, such Asset Swap Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, resulting in the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Non-Euro Obligation from the Issuer and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition thereof, for the avoidance of doubt, net of any termination cost in respect of the early termination of the Asset Swap Transaction, as determined and incurred by the Asset Swap Counterparty in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement) to the Issuer.
Replacement Asset Swap Transactions

If any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each as defined in the applicable Asset Swap Agreement) the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction within 30 calendar days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which satisfies, among other things, the applicable Rating Requirement and which has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.
If any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in the circumstances referred to above, any Asset Swap Termination Receipt will be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and shall be applied towards the costs of entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, together with, where necessary, Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that are available for such purpose on any Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation, save:
(a) where termination of the Asset Swap Transaction occurs on a Redemption Date pursuant to Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption), Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (other than in connection with a Refinancing), Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or Condition 10 (Events of Default); or
(b) to the extent that such Asset Swap Termination Receipt is not required for application towards any Asset Swap Replacement Payment,
in which event such Asset Swap Termination Receipt shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
If the Issuer receives any Asset Swap Replacement Receipt upon entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, such amount shall be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and applied directly by the Collateral Administrator acting on the instructions of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in payment of any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable upon termination of the Asset Swap Transaction being so replaced. To the extent not fully paid out of Asset Swap Replacement Receipts, any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable by the Issuer shall be paid to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty on the next Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. To the extent not required for making any such Asset Swap Termination Payment, such Asset Swap Replacement Receipts shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Replacement Asset Swap Transaction at the time the Collateral Manager sells an Asset Swap Obligation. Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Replacement Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Subject to paragraph (a) above, if a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction cannot be entered within 30 calendar days of the termination of the Asset Swap Transaction, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer,
shall use all reasonable endeavours to sell the applicable Non-Euro Obligation, pay the proceeds thereof to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty, to the extent required pursuant to the terms of such Asset Swap Transaction and/or to the extent not so required, shall direct the Collateral Administrator to convert all of such proceeds into Euro at the Applicable Exchange Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account. If such proceeds are insufficient to pay any Asset Swap Termination Payments in full, such amount, including any Defaulted Hedge Termination Payment, shall be paid out of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds on the next following Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions from time to time in order to hedge any interest rate mismatch between the Rated Notes and the Collateral Obligations and for no other purpose, subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof and provided that the Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction at the time it sells the related Collateral Obligations. At such time, the Interest Rate Hedge Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

If an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each such term as defined in the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Agreement), the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within 30 calendar days of termination thereof with an Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty which satisfies the applicable Ratings Requirement and which has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents. The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction at the time it sells the related Collateral Obligation. At such time, the Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Standard Terms of the Hedge Agreements
Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is agreed by the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty and subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in respect thereof.
Gross up

Under each Hedge Agreement neither the Issuer nor the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder if there is any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Any such event may however result in a “Tax Event” which is a “Termination Event” for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. If a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement) occurs, each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant Affected Party (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours to: (a) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (b) (in the case of the Issuer) transfer its residence for tax purposes to another jurisdiction or if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation).
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition

The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment).
The Issuer will have the benefit of limited recourse and non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).
Termination Provisions

Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of the following events (which may include without limitation):
(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account any applicable grace period;
(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or to perform its obligations under, the applicable Hedge Agreement;
(d) the principal due in respect of the Notes is declared to be due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, and the Trustee has started to sell all or part of the Collateral as a consequence thereof;
(e) the Notes are redeemed in whole prior to the Maturity Date (otherwise than as a result of an Event of Default thereunder);
(f) regulatory changes occur which have a material adverse effect on a Hedge Counterparty; and
(g) material changes are made to the Transaction Documents without the consent of a Hedge Counterparty which could have a material adverse effect on the Hedge Counterparty.
A termination of a Hedge Agreement does not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes, though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an “additional termination event” under a Hedge Agreement.
Asset Swap Agreements may also contain provisions which allow an Asset Swap Transaction to terminate upon the occurrence of certain credit events related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These credit events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation. In such instances the related Asset Swap Transaction would terminate and the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) may need to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation unless a new Asset Swap Transaction can be entered into.
Rating Downgrade Requirements

Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies for the type of derivatives transaction represented by the Hedge Transactions if the Hedge Counterparty or, as relevant, its guarantor, is subject to a voting withdrawal or downgrade by a Rating Agency to below the applicable Rating Requirement. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation.
Transfer and Modification

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation and KBRA Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge Agreement following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.
Governing Law
Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder in each case, including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data
The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time enter into agreements with Hedge Counterparties (each a “Reporting Agreement”) in a form approved by the Rating Agencies for the provision of certain information in connection with the performance of such Hedge Counterparty of certain derivative reporting obligations on behalf of the Issuer.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

General
Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.
Potential purchasers who are in any doubt about their tax position on purchase, ownership, transfer or exercise of any Note should consult their own tax advisers. In particular, no representation is made as to the manner in which payments under the Notes would be characterised by any relevant tax authority. Potential investors should be aware that the relevant fiscal rules or their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, and that this summary is not exhaustive. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice or a guarantee to any potential investor of the tax consequences of investing in the Notes.
Irish Taxation
The following is a summary of the principal Irish tax consequences for individuals and companies of ownership of the Notes based on the laws and practice of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland currently in force in Ireland and may be subject to change. It deals with Noteholders who beneficially own their Notes as an investment. Particular rules not discussed below may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding Notes, such as dealers in securities, trusts etc. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and the receipt of interest thereon under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship or domicile.
Taxation of Noteholders Withholding Tax
In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.), is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest which should include interest payable on the Notes. The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note so long as interest paid on the relevant Note falls within one of the following categories
1. Interest paid on a quoted Eurobond: The Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note where:

(a) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds, i.e., securities which are issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are listed on a recognised stock exchange (such as the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin) and which carry a right to interest; and
(b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland, or if such person is in Ireland, either:
(i) the Notes are held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are, amongst others, so recognised); or
(ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the Notes and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland) in the prescribed form; and
(c) one of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) the Noteholder is resident for tax purposes in Ireland; or
(ii) the Noteholder is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, premium or other distribution, to a tax in a relevant territory which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory; or
(iii) the Noteholder is not a company which, for the purposes of the section 110 of the TCA, directly or indirectly, controls the Issuer, is controlled by the Issuer, or is controlled by
a third company which also directly or indirectly controls the Issuer, and neither the Noteholder, nor any person connected with the Noteholder, is a person or persons:
(A) from whom the Issuer has acquired assets;
(B) to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances;
(C) to whom loans or advances held by the Issuer were made; or
(D) with whom the Issuer has entered into a swap agreement,
where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or swap agreements represents not less than 75 per cent. of the assets of the Issuer; or
(iv) at the time of issue of the Notes, the Issuer was not in possession, or aware, of any information which could reasonably be taken to indicate whether or not the beneficial owner of the Notes would be subject to tax on any interest payments,
where the term:
“control” is defined in section 110 of the TCA, and may include certain persons who both, directly or indirectly: (i) hold more than 20% of the principal amount of, or interest payable in respect of, any of the Issuer’s securities which bear interest which exceeds a commercial rate of return or is to any extent dependent on the results of the Issuer’s business: and (ii) exercise ‘significant influence’ over the Issuer.
“relevant territory” means a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a country with which Ireland has signed a double tax treaty (“Relevant Territory”); and
“swap agreement” means any agreement, arrangement or understanding that—
(i) provides for the exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of one or more payments based on the value, rate or amount of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof, and
(ii) transfers to a person who is a party to the agreement, arrangement or understanding or to a person connected with that person, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value, rate or amount without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset (including any enterprise or investment pool) or liability that incorporates the financial risk so transferred.
Thus, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, are held in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c) above is met, interest on the Notes can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognised clearing system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside Ireland and one of the conditions set out in paragraph (c) above is met.
2. Interest paid by a qualifying company to certain non-residents: If, for any reason, the exemption referred to above ceases to apply, interest payments may still be made free of withholding tax provided that:

2.1 the Issuer remains a “qualifying company” as defined in Section 110 of the TCA and the Noteholder is a person which is resident in a Relevant Territory, and, where the recipient is a body corporate, the interest is not paid to it in connection with a trade or business carried on by it in Ireland through a branch or agency. The test of residence is determined by reference to the law of
the Relevant Territory in which the Noteholder claims to be resident. The Issuer must be satisfied that the terms of the exemption are satisfied; and

2.2 one of the following conditions is satisfied:

(a) the Noteholder is a pension fund, government body or other person (which satisfies paragraph (c)(iii) above), which is resident in a Relevant Territory and which, under the laws of that territory, is exempted from tax that corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains in that territory; or
(b) the interest is subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, to a tax in a Relevant Territory which corresponds to income tax or corporation tax in Ireland and which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory.
Deductibility of Interest

Rules contained in the Finance Act 2016 and the Finance Act 2017 restrict deductibility of interest paid by a qualifying company (such as the Issuer) that is profit dependent or exceeds a reasonable commercial return to the extent that the interest is associated with the business of a qualifying company of holding ‘specified mortgages’, units in an IREF (being a specific form of investment undertaking within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA) or shares that derive their value or the greater part of their value from Irish land subject to a number of exceptions. A ‘specified mortgage’ for this purpose is (a) a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land, or (b) a ‘specified agreement’ (effectively a profit dependent derivative) which derives all of its value, or the greater part of its value, directly or indirectly, from Irish land or a loan to which (a) applies or (c) the portion of a specified security (essentially a security in respect of which, if the Finance Act 2016 and the Finance Act 2017 rules did not apply to, payments on that security would be deductible under section 110 of the TCA) attributable to the specified property business in accordance with the rules.
The legislation treats the holding of such assets as a separate business to the rest of the qualifying company’s activities. The qualifying company is taxed on any profit that is attributable to that business at 25 per cent. and any such interest that is profit dependent or exceeds a reasonable commercial return is not deductible, subject to a number of exceptions, and potentially subject to Irish withholding tax at 20 per cent.
Accordingly, on the basis that the Issuer will not acquire ‘specified mortgages’ for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA, units in an IREF (being a specific form of investment undertaking within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA) or shares that derive their value or the greater part of their value from Irish land (as to which, see the Section entitled “The Portfolio – Eligibility Criteria” at (gg)), the new rules should not apply to this transaction.
Ireland’s Finance Act 2019 introduced some measures which may restrict the extent to which interest payable in respect of results-dependent securities (such as the Subordinated Notes) may be deducted for Irish tax purposes. The measures provide that in many cases interest paid to persons which both, directly or indirectly, hold more than 20.0 per cent. of any results-dependent securities issued by the Issuer (or the interest payable in respect of them) and exercise “significant influence” over the Issuer may only be deducted for Irish tax purposes to the extent it is paid to a person that is resident in Ireland or is subject to tax in a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a jurisdiction with which Ireland has a double tax treaty. The term “significant influence” is defined as meaning an ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the Issuer. The changes to Ireland’s tax legislation came into force as of 1 January 2020. It remains to be seen how the measures will be applied in practice and, as a result, it is not clear who could be considered to exercise “significant influence” over the Issuer.
Encashment Tax

Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.
Income Tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge

Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax, the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish tax with respect to such interest. Noteholders resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland who are individuals may be liable to pay Irish income tax, social insurance (PRSI) contributions and the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.
Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore may be within the charge to Irish income tax, notwithstanding that the Noteholder is not resident in Ireland. In the case of Noteholders who are non-resident individuals such Noteholders may also be liable to pay the universal social charge in respect of interest they receive on the Notes.
Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of tax and any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within its scope.
There are a number of exemptions from Irish income tax available to certain non-residents. Firstly, interest payments made by the Issuer are exempt from income tax so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA, the recipient is not resident in Ireland and is resident in a Relevant Territory and, the interest is paid out of the assets of the Issuer. Secondly, interest payments made by the Issuer in the ordinary course of its trade or business to a company are exempt from income tax provided the recipient company is not resident in Ireland and is either resident for tax purposes in a Relevant Territory which imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside that territory or the interest is exempted from the charge to Irish income tax under the terms of a double tax agreement which is either in force or which will come into force once all ratification procedures have been completed. Thirdly, interest paid by the Issuer free of withholding tax under the quoted Eurobond exemption is exempt from income tax where the recipient is a person not resident in Ireland and resident in a relevant territory or is a company which is under the control, whether directly or indirectly, of person(s) who by virtue of the law of a relevant territory are resident for the purposes of tax in a relevant territory and is not under the control of person(s) who are not so resident or is a company where the principal class of shares of the company or its 75 per cent. parent is substantially and regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange. For the purpose of these exemptions and where not specified otherwise, residence is determined under the terms of the relevant double taxation agreement or, in any other case, the law of the country in which the recipient claims to be resident. Interest falling within the above exemptions is also exempt from the universal social charge.
Notwithstanding these exemptions from income tax, a corporate recipient that carries on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes are held or attributed, may have a liability to Irish corporation tax on the interest.
Relief from Irish income tax may also be available under the specific provisions of a double tax treaty between Ireland and the country of residence of the recipient.
Interest on the Notes which does not fall within the above exemptions is within the charge to income tax, and, in the case of Noteholders who are individuals, the charge to the universal social charge. In the past the Irish Revenue Commissioners have not pursued liability to income tax in respect of persons who are not regarded as being resident in Ireland except where such persons have a taxable presence of some sort in Ireland or seek to claim any relief or repayment in respect of Irish tax. However, there can be no assurance that the Irish Revenue Commissioners will apply this treatment in the case of any Noteholder.
Capital Gains Tax

A holder of Notes will not be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of Notes unless (i) such holder is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland or (ii) such holder carries on a trade or business in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes were used or held or (iii) the Notes cease to be listed on a stock exchange in circumstances where the Notes derive their value or more than 50 per cent. of their value from Irish real estate, mineral rights or exploration rights.
Capital Acquisitions Tax

A gift or inheritance comprising of Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax (which subject to available exemptions and reliefs, is currently levied at 33 per cent) if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the
disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) on the relevant date or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situated in Ireland (i.e. if the Notes are physically located in Ireland or if the register of the Notes is maintained in Ireland).
Stamp Duty

No stamp duty or similar tax is imposed in Ireland (on the basis of an exemption provided for in Section 85(2)(c) of the Irish Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999 so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA and the proceeds of the Notes are used in the course of the Issuer’s business), on the issue, transfer or redemption of the Notes.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

General
The following discussion summarises certain of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of the Notes.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States, for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions.
For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 a nonresident alien individual for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 an estate whose income is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis; or
 a trust if no court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration or if no United States persons have the authority to control any of its substantial decisions.
An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).
This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes for cash at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors)) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or
other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes. Finally, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of a Contribution to a Contributor as described in Condition 2(l) (Contributions).
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Issuer
The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Milbank LLP to the effect that if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including certain tax guidelines set forth therein (the “U.S. Tax Guidelines”), and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the U.S. Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or an Event of Default under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) to receive written advice from nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the U.S. Tax Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Milbank LLP will not address any such changes or departures. The opinion of Milbank LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (notwithstanding that the Collateral Manager is acting in accordance with the U.S. Tax Guidelines). Finally, the opinion of Milbank LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
If it were determined that the Issuer was engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer had taxable income that was effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer would be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income (computed possibly without any allowance for deductions), and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such taxes on the Issuer would materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Notes
Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class B-2 Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be received with respect to the Class F Notes. The Issuer intends to treat each Class of the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that one or more Classes of Rated Notes are equity in the Issuer. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules relating to U.S. equity owners in PFICs or CFCs. See “U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes – Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes” below. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder, by its purchase of a Subordinated Note, agrees to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
Finally, the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes

Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes and Class B-2 Notes.

Stated Interest. U.S. Holders of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes will include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest accrued or received on their Notes, in accordance with their usual method of tax accounting, as ordinary interest income.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes that use the cash method of accounting will calculate the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the time a payment is received.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes that use the accrual method of accounting or that otherwise are required to accrue stated interest before receipt will calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, in the case of an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the
U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of such payments when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Original Issue Discount. In addition, if the discount at which a substantial amount of the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes is first sold to investors is at least 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of the Class, multiplied by the number of complete years to the weighted average maturity of the Class, then the Issuer will treat the Class as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Note within the Class will equal the excess of the principal amount of the Note over its issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the Class was sold to investors).
U.S. Holders of Notes that are issued with OID will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders of the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of the Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, in the case of an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes that are issued with OID also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of principal payments on their Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes or Class B-2 Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in its Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by the U.S. dollar value of any such amount includable in income as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of payments of principal on such Note (based, in the case of a Class A Note, a Class B-1 Note or a Class B-2 Note, on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received).
A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class A Note, a Class B-1 Note or a Class B-2 Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note on the date that the Note was acquired (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class A Note, a Class B-1 Note or a Class B-2 Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement (less any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above) and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes

Original Issue Discount. The Issuer will treat the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note will equal the sum of all payments to be received under such Note less its issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors). U.S. Holders of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate
during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, in the case of an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments and/or principal payments on their Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder of a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note will have a basis in such Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by any amount includable in income by such U.S. Holder as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of any payments received on such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received). A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note on the date that the Note was acquired (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled
to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
Base Rate Change

The treatment of a replacement of the reference rate on the Floating Rates Notes with a substitute or successor rate (a “Base Rate Change”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes is unclear. If the Base Rate Change is treated as a “significant modification” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Base Rate Change could cause a U.S. Holder that holds Notes that are subject to the Base Rate Change to recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between (A)(i) the fair market value of the modified Rated Notes (if the Class is treated as publicly traded) or their principal amount (if the Class is not treated as publicly traded), less (ii) any accrued and unpaid interest (which will be taxable as such), and (B) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Notes. Any gain will be long‐term capital gain if the applicable Notes were treated as held for more than one year at the time of the Base Rate Change, or otherwise short‐term capital gain. The tax on any such gain may exceed the after‐tax distributions on the modified Rated Notes during the taxable year in which the Base Rate Change occurs, in which case the U.S. Holder would be required to fund its tax liability in respect of the gain from other sources. In the event that a Base Rate Change is treated as a significant modification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that a U.S. Holder’s holding period in respect of the modified Rated Notes will begin on the day following the modification. U.S. Holders may not be permitted to recognize loss upon a Base Rate Change. Finally, a Base Rate Change could create or change the amount of any OID that U.S. Holders are required to include with respect to their Rated Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a Base Rate Change.
Alternative Characterisation

It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Holder’s OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
Receipt of Euro

U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes

As described above under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Notes,” the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer will be a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. dollar value of gain on the sale of the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and the U.S. dollar value of certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Holder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by writing “Protective QEF Election” on the top of an IRS Form 8621, filling out the form, checking Box A (Election to Treat the PFIC as a QEF) and filing the form with the IRS with respect to their Class E Notes or Class F Notes, or by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Holder’s ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a “qualified electing fund” (a “QEF”) and so electing at the appropriate time. Such a U.S. Holder also will be required to file an annual PFIC report. The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the expense of the requesting U.S. Holder, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes making a “protective” QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a CFC, and a
U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes – Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” with respect to its Class E Notes or Class F Notes.
If the Issuer holds any Collateral Obligations that are treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, U.S. Holders of Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder would be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 926 with respect to their Class E Notes or Class F Notes.
Finally, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the IRS if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 5471 with respect to their Class E Notes or Class F Notes.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. Prospective U.S. Holders of Class E Notes or Class F Notes should consult with their tax advisers regarding whether to make protective filings of IRS Forms 8621, 926 and 5471 with respect to such Notes and the consequences to them if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes
Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. The Issuer will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be subject to the PFIC rules, except for certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC (as described below under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”). U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should consider making an election to treat the Issuer as a QEF. Generally, a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election on IRS Form 8621, attaching a copy of that form to its U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it held its Subordinated Notes. If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the electing U.S. Holder will be required in each taxable year to include in gross income (i) as ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and (ii) as long-term capital gain, the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s net capital gain, whether or not distributed. A U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.
In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute all of its earnings in a taxable year, the electing U.S. Holder may also be permitted to elect to defer payment of some or all of the taxes on the QEF’s income, subject to an interest charge (which is non-deductible to individuals) on the deferred amount. In this regard, prospective purchasers of Subordinated Notes should be aware that it is expected that the Collateral Obligations will include high yield debt obligations and such instruments may have substantial OID, the cash payment of which may be deferred, perhaps for a substantial period of time. In addition, the Issuer may use proceeds from the sale of Collateral Obligations to retire other Classes of Notes. As a result, in any given year, the Issuer may have
substantial amounts of earnings for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are not distributed on the Subordinated Notes. Thus, absent an election to defer payment of taxes, U.S. Holders that make a QEF election with respect to the Issuer may owe tax on significant “phantom” income.
The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (other than certain U.S. Holders that are subject to the rules relating to a CFC, described below) that does not make a timely QEF election will be required to report the U.S. dollar value of any gain on the disposition of its Subordinated Notes as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, and to compute the tax liability on such gain and any “Excess Distribution” (as defined below) received in respect of the Subordinated Notes as if such items had been earned ratably over each day in the U.S. Holder’s holding period (or a certain portion thereof) for the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. Holder will be subject to tax on such gain or Excess Distributions at the highest ordinary income tax rate for each taxable year in which such gain or Excess Distributions are treated as having been earned, other than the current year (for which the U.S. Holder’s regular ordinary income tax rate will apply), regardless of the rate otherwise applicable to the U.S. Holder. Further, such
U.S. Holder will also be liable for an interest charge (which is non-deductible to individuals) as if such income tax liabilities had been due with respect to each such year. For purposes of these rules, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganisations and use of the Subordinated Notes as security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions of such Subordinated Notes. In addition, a stepped-up basis in the Subordinated Notes will not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. Holder who has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer.
An “Excess Distribution” is the amount by which the U.S. dollar value of distributions during a taxable year in respect of a Subordinated Note exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions in respect thereof during the three preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Note).
In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made. A U.S. HOLDER OF A SUBORDINATED NOTE SHOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER MAKING A QEF ELECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER.
Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Issuer will be a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the equity interests in the Issuer, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by 10 per cent. United States shareholders. For this purpose, a “10 per cent. United States shareholder” is any United States person that possesses directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of equity in the Issuer. Thus a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (and/or any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) possessing directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and, if applicable, any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) would be treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), determined with respect to the combined voting power or value of the Subordinated Notes (and if applicable, any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such 10 per cent. United States shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. If, for any given taxable year, the Issuer is treated as a CFC, a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer will be required to include as ordinary income an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of that person’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s “subpart F income” at the end of such taxable year. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were a CFC, all of its income would be subpart F income.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Holder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the “qualified portion” of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains
generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Holder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Holder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified portion and has not made a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In that case, the Issuer will again be treated as a PFIC which is not a QEF with respect to the U.S. Holder and the beginning of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will continue to be the date upon which the U.S. Holder acquired the Subordinated Notes, unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to recognise gain with respect to the Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, the Issuer will provide the information necessary for the U.S. Holder to comply with any filing requirements that arise as a result of the Issuer’s classification as a CFC.
Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs. If the Issuer owns a Collateral Obligation that is treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences.
In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The
U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.
If a Collateral Obligation is treated as an indirect equity interest in a CFC and a U.S. Holder owns directly, indirectly, or constructively 10 per cent. or more of the CFC’s voting power or value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Holder generally will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” as ordinary income at the end of each taxable year, as described above under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” regardless of whether the CFC distributed any amounts to the Issuer during such taxable year or whether the U.S. Holder made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held CFC. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of the CFC, and the U.S. dollar value of gain realised by the U.S. Holder on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (as described below), generally will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, reduced by any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax issues associated with such investments in light of their own individual circumstances.
Phantom Income. U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the amounts that exceed the distributions they receive on the Subordinated Notes. For example, if the Issuer is a CFC and a U.S. Holder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, or a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to the Issuer, the U.S. Holder will be subject to federal income tax with respect to its share of the Issuer’s income and gain (to the extent of the Issuer’s “earnings and profits”), which may exceed the Issuer’s distributions. It is expected that the Issuer’s income and gain (and earnings and profits) will exceed cash distributions with respect to (i) debt instruments that were issued with OID and are held by the Issuer, and (ii) the acquisition at a discount of the Rated Notes by the Issuer (including by reason of a Refinancing or any deemed exchange that occurs for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a Base Rate Change or a modification of the Trust Deed).
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the timing of income and gain on the Subordinated Notes.
Distributions. The treatment of actual distributions of cash on the Subordinated Notes will vary depending on whether the U.S. Holder of such Subordinated Notes has made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer or whether the Issuer is a CFC of which the U.S. Holder is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder (as described above). See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” and “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”. If a timely QEF election has been made, distributions should be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) and to this extent will not be taxable to such U.S. Holder. Distributions in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes (as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”), and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, a U.S. Holder will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the distribution on the date received and the U.S. dollar value of the previously taxed amount. Any exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss.
If a U.S. Holder has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer then, except to the extent that distributions are attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules, some or all of any distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes may constitute Excess Distributions, taxable as described above under the heading “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”. Distributions that do not constitute Excess Distributions will be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income upon receipt to the extent of untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer. Distributions that do not constitute Excess Distributions and are in excess of untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes, and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge, as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”.
Distributions on the Subordinated Notes will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and will not qualify as “qualified dividend income”.
Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition. In general, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes will recognise gain or loss upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes (including a distribution that is treated as a disposition of the Subordinated Notes, as described above under “Distributions”) equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Subordinated Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year.
A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its Subordinated Notes initially will equal the U.S. dollar value of the amount paid by the U.S. Holder for the Subordinated Notes, determined under rules analogous to the rules for determining the
U.S. dollar value of the amount realised. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Holder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a non-taxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.
If the U.S. Holder has made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer, then, except to the extent that the Issuer is treated as a CFC and the U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, gain or loss upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election from the date of each deemed distribution pursuant to the election (based on the average euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the applicable taxable year) to the date of the disposition. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Subordinated Notes for more than one year at the time of the disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
If a U.S. Holder does not make a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer as described above and is not subject to the CFC rules, any gain realised on the sale, redemption, or other disposition of a Subordinated Note (or any gain deemed to accrue prior to the time a non-timely QEF election is made) will be taxed as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax reflecting a deemed interest charge under the special tax rules described above. See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, then any gain or loss realised by the U.S. Holder upon a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes, other than gain or loss subject to the PFIC rules, if applicable, generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules from the date of each deemed distribution pursuant to the CFC rules (based on the average euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the applicable taxable year) to the date of the disposition. Any gain in excess of foreign currency exchange gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s previously untaxed earnings and profits.
In addition, as described above under “Indirect Interests in PFICs and CFCs,” the U.S. dollar value of any gain attributable to interests in PFICs or CFCs owned by the Issuer may be treated as ordinary income to a U.S. Holder upon the sale, redemption, or other disposition of the U.S. Holder’s Subordinated Notes.
If the Issuer is treated as a CFC, in certain cases, a corporate U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer may be eligible for a dividends received deduction to the extent any gain recognized on the disposition of a Subordinated Note is treated as ordinary income, or to the extent that such 10 per cent. United States shareholder receives a distribution that is treated as a dividend in the year in which it disposes of a Subordinated Note, in each case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of any dividends received deduction and the impact of such dividends received deduction on any such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Subordinated Notes.
Receipt of Euro. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Transfer and Information Reporting Requirements. A U.S. Holder that purchases the Subordinated Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such transfer exceeds $100,000.
A U.S. Holder that is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes generally will be required to file an annual PFIC report.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Subordinated Notes.
Specified Foreign Financial Asset Reporting
Certain U.S. Holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other “specified foreign financial assets” (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds $50,000. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.
3.8 per cent. Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income”
U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax and special rules apply with respect to the PFIC and CFC rules described above. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax.
FBAR Reporting
A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Holder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer’s outstanding equity.
Reportable Transactions
A participant in a “reportable transaction” is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisers with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders of Notes
In general, payments on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to
U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Under certain circumstances, the Code requires “information reporting” annually to the IRS and to each holder, and “backup withholding” with respect to certain payments made on or with respect to the Notes. Backup withholding will apply to a U.S. Holder only if the U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”) which, for an individual, would be his or her Social Security Number, (ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report payments of interest and dividends, or (iv) under certain circumstances, fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments. The exemption generally is available to U.S. Holders that provide a properly completed IRS Form W- 9.
A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS information reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding.
Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of Notes made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be refunded (or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any), provided that certain required information is furnished. The information reporting requirements may apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Copies of the information returns also may
be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.
FATCA
Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that will require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer expects to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the Irish implementing regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information or documentation to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Changes Affecting Noteholders
Future legislation, regulations, rulings or other authority could affect the federal income tax treatment of the Issuer and Noteholders. The Issuer cannot predict whether and to what extent any such legislative or administrative changes could change the tax consequences to the Issuer and to the Noteholders. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisers regarding possible legislative and administrative changes and their effect on the federal tax treatment of the Issuer and their investment in the Notes.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” subject thereto and on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification and investments being made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, the “Plan Asset Regulation”), if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each, a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.
If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their exposure to liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise Parties in Interest by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes,
the Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by Controlling Persons). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note (or any interest therein) will be required to or deemed to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note (or any interest therein) will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class in accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA, the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.
Even if the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes would not be treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.
Each of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to, one or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).
It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that section of ERISA at 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.
Each purchaser and transferee of a Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note or Class D Note or any interest in such Note will be required or deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) either (A) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (“Other Plan Law”), and no part of the assets to be used by it to acquire or hold such Note or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or such governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, or (B) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a violation of any Other Plan Law, and (ii) it will not sell or transfer such Note (or interest therein) to a transferee acquiring such Note (or interest therein) unless the transferee makes the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements described in clause (i) hereof.
On the Issue Date, each purchaser of a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that: (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be
acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person unless it receives the written consent of the Issuer and provides an ERISA certificate (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed) to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; (ii) (A) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (B) if it is a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (1) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein will not be, subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to Other Plan Law (“Similar Law”) and (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a violation of any Other Plan Law; and (iii) it will agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Note. Other than on the Issue Date, each purchaser of a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that: (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person unless it receives the written consent of the Issuer, provides an ERISA certificate (in or substantially in the form of Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed) to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and, other than with respect to Retention Notes, holds such Class E Note or Class F Note, as applicable, in the form of a Definitive Certificate; (ii) (A) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (B) if it is a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (1) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein will not be, subject to any Similar Law and (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a violation of any Other Plan Law; and (iii) it will agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Note. Any purported transfer of the Class E Notes or Class F Notes in violation of the requirements set forth in this paragraph shall be null and void ab initio and the Issuer will have the right to cause the sale of such Class E Notes or Class F Notes to another acquirer that complies with the requirements of this paragraph in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed.
Each purchaser and transferee of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate will be required to: (i) represent and warrant in writing to the Issuer (A) whether or not, for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein, it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, (B) whether or not, for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein, it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Controlling Person and (C) that (1) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and (2) if it is a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (x) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein will not be, subject to any Similar Law and (y) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a violation of any Other Plan Law; (ii) agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Note; (iii) provide an ERISA certificate (in or substantially in the form set out at Annex A (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed) to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent; and (iv) provide a Relevant Declaration to the Issuer. Any purported transfer of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in violation of the requirements set forth in this paragraph shall be null and void ab initio and the Issuer will have the right to cause the sale of such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes to another acquirer that complies with the requirements of this paragraph in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed.
No purchase or transfer of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or any interest therein) will be permitted or recognised if it would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation described above to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class).
If the purchaser or transferee of any Note or beneficial interest therein is a Benefit Plan Investor, it will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Placement Agent, the Trustee or the Collateral Manager, or their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”), has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied in connection with its decision to invest in the Note, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Note; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Note.
Any Plan fiduciary considering whether to acquire a Note on behalf of a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code should consult with its counsel regarding the potential consequences of such investment, the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code or provisions of Similar Law or Other Plan Law, and the scope of any available exemption relating to such investment.
The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, or that this investment is appropriate for Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
The following description consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Placement Agency Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not otherwise defined herein or in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the terms and conditions of the Notes.

Citigroup Global Markets Limited (in its capacity as placement agent, the “Placement Agent”) has agreed with the Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to facilitate the sale by the Issuer of each Class of the Notes (other than any Notes being sold directly by the Issuer to the Retention Holder and its Affiliates) (the “Citi Placed Notes”) pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement. The Placement Agency Agreement entitles the Placement Agent to terminate it in certain circumstances prior to payment being made to the Issuer.
The Retention Holder, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, will purchase the Retention Notes from the Issuer at their respective issue prices set out in the Retention Note Purchase Agreement. An Affiliate of the Retention Holder will purchase certain Subordinated Notes from the Issuer pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement.
The Placement Agent may offer the Citi Placed Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and which may be different to the issue price of the Notes.
It is a condition of the issue of the Notes of each Class that the Notes of each other Class be issued in the following principal amounts: Class A Notes: €186,000,000, Class B-1 Notes: €11,850,000, Class B-2 Notes: €15,150,000, Class C Notes: €31,800,000, Class D Notes: €13,800,000, Class E Notes: €14,400,000, Class F Notes: €6,800,000 and Subordinated Notes: €21,425,000.
Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent, against certain liabilities or to contribute to payments it may be required to make in respect thereof.
Certain of the Collateral Obligations may have been originally underwritten or placed by the Placement Agent. In addition, the Placement Agent may have in the past performed and may in the future perform investment banking services or other services for issuers of the Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Placement Agent and its Affiliates may from time to time as a principal or through one or more investment funds that it or they manage, make investments in the equity securities of one or more of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations, with a result that one or more of such issuers may be or may become controlled by the Placement Agent or its Affiliates.
No action has been or will be taken by the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager or the Retention Holder that would permit a public offering of the Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material in relation to the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required, other than the application of this Offering Circular to and by Euronext Dublin. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or from any jurisdiction, except in circumstances which will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Placement Agent.
United States

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. Persons or to U.S. Residents except in certain transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in the manner so as not to require the registration of the Issuer as an “investment company” pursuant to the Investment Company Act.
The Issuer has been advised that the Placement Agent proposes to sell the Citi Placed Notes: (a) outside the U.S. to non-U.S. Persons in “offshore transactions” in reliance on Regulation S and in accordance with applicable law; and (b) in the U.S. (directly or through its U.S. broker dealer Affiliate) in reliance on Rule 144A only to or for the accounts of QIBs, each of such purchasers or accountholders is also a QP.
The Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A will be issued in minimum denominations of €250,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any offer or sale of Rule 144A Notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. After the Citi Placed Notes are released for sale, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the Placement Agent.
The Placement Agent has acknowledged and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver any Citi Placed Notes that are Regulation S Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident as part of their distribution at any time and that it will send to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration to which it sells such Regulation S Notes a confirmation or other notice setting forth the prohibition on offers and sales of such Regulation S Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.
This Offering Circular has been prepared by the Issuer for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes and for the listing of the Notes of each Class on the Global Exchange Market. The Issuer and the Placement Agent each reserves the right to reject any offer to purchase, in whole or in part, for any reason, or to sell less than the principal amount of Notes which may be offered. This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to any person in the United States or to any U.S. Person. Distribution of this Offering Circular to any such U.S. Person or to any person within the United States, other than in accordance with the procedures described above, is unauthorised and any disclosure of any of its contents, without the prior written consent of the Issuer and the Placement Agent, is prohibited.

The Notes have been issued or sold by the Placement Agent in reliance on paragraph (14) of Code Section 10-5-11 of the Georgia Securities Act of 2006, as amended, and may not be sold or transferred except in a transaction which is exempt under such Act or pursuant to an effective registration under such Act.
TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or “Blue Sky” laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, accordingly, may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the restrictions described herein and set forth in the Trust Deed.
Without limiting the foregoing, by holding a Note, you will acknowledge and agree, among other things, that you understand that the Issuer is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and that the Issuer intends to rely on an exemption from registration by virtue of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) excepts from the provisions of the Investment Company Act those issuers who privately place their securities solely to, and whose securities are held solely by, persons who at the time of purchase are “qualified purchasers” or entities owned exclusively by “qualified purchasers”. In general terms, qualified purchaser includes any natural person who owns not less than U.S.$5,000,000 in investments; any person who in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than U.S.$25,000,000 in investments; and trusts as to which both the settlor and the decision-making trustee are qualified purchasers (but only if such trust was not formed for the specific purpose of making such investment).
Rule 144A Notes
Each prospective purchaser of Rule 144A Notes, by accepting delivery of this Offering Circular, will be deemed to have represented and agreed that such person acknowledges that this Offering Circular is personal to it and does not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire Notes other than pursuant to Rule 144A or in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Distribution of this Offering Circular, or disclosure of any of its contents to any person other than such offeree and those persons, if any, retained to advise it with respect thereto is unauthorised and any disclosure of any of its contents, without the prior written consent of the Issuer, is prohibited.
Each purchaser of Notes represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate will be deemed to have represented and agreed, and each purchaser of Notes represented by Definitive Certificates will be required to represent and agree, as follows:
1. The purchaser (a) is a QIB, (b) is aware that the sale of such Rule 144A Notes to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (c) is acquiring such Notes for its own account or for the account of a QIB as to which the purchaser exercises sole investment discretion, and in a principal amount of not less than

The purchaser understands that the Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act. The purchaser understands that before any interest in a Rule 144A Note may be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Notes, the Registrar is required to receive a written certification from the purchaser (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) as to compliance with the transfer restrictions described herein. The purchaser understands and agrees that any purported transfer of the Rule 144A Notes to a purchaser that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph (2) shall be null and void ab initio.
3. The purchaser is not purchasing such Rule 144A Notes with a view toward the resale, distribution or other disposition thereof in violation of the Securities Act. The purchaser understands that an investment in the Rule 144A Notes involves certain risks, including the risk of loss of its entire investment in the Rule 144A Notes under certain circumstances. The purchaser has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and the Notes as it deemed necessary or appropriate in order to make
an informed investment decision with respect to its purchase of the Rule 144A Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer.
4. In connection with the purchase of the Rule 144A Notes: (a) none of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator is acting as a fiduciary or financial or investment manager for the purchaser; (b) the purchaser is not relying (for purposes of making any investment decision or otherwise) upon any advice, counsel or representations (whether written or oral) of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator other than in this Offering Circular for such Notes and any representations expressly set forth in a written agreement with such party; (c) none of the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator has given to the purchaser (directly or indirectly through any other person) any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) as to an investment in the Rule 144A Notes; (d) the purchaser has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial and accounting advisors to the extent it has deemed necessary, and it has made its own investment decisions (including decisions regarding the suitability of any transaction pursuant to the Trust Deed) based upon its own judgment and upon any advice from such advisors as it has deemed necessary and not upon any view expressed by the Issuer, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator; (e) the purchaser has evaluated the rates, prices or amounts and other terms and conditions of the purchase and sale of the Rule 144A Notes with a full understanding of all of the risks thereof (economic and otherwise), and it is capable of assuming and willing to assume (financially and otherwise) those risks; and (f) the purchaser is a sophisticated investor.
5. The purchaser and each account for which the purchaser is acquiring such Rule 144A Notes is a QP. The purchaser is acquiring the Rule 144A Notes in a principal amount of not less than €250,000. The purchaser and each such account is acquiring the Rule 144A Notes as principal for its own account for investment and not for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. The purchaser and each such account: (a) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Rule 144A Notes (except when each beneficial owner of the purchaser and each such account is a QP); (b) to the extent the purchaser is a private investment company formed before 30 April 1996, the purchaser has received the necessary consent from its beneficial owners; (c) is not a pension, profit sharing or other retirement trust fund or plan in which the partners, beneficiaries or participants, as applicable, may designate the particular investments to be made; and (d) is not a broker dealer that owns and invests on a discretionary basis less than $25,000,000 in securities of unaffiliated issues. Further, the purchaser agrees with respect to itself and each such account: (x) that it shall not hold such Rule 144A Notes for the benefit of any other person and shall be the sole beneficial owner thereof for all purposes; (y) that it shall not sell participation interests in the Rule 144A Notes or enter into any other arrangement pursuant to which any other person shall be entitled to a beneficial interest in the distributions on the Rule 144A Notes; and (z) that the Rule 144A Notes purchased directly or indirectly by it constitute an investment of no more than 40 per cent. of the purchaser’s and each such account’s assets (except when each beneficial owner of the purchaser and each such account is a QP). The purchaser understands and agrees that any purported transfer of the Rule 144A Notes to a purchaser that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph (5) will be of no force and effect, will be void ab initio and the Issuer will have the right to direct the purchaser to transfer its Rule 144A Notes to a Person who meets the foregoing criteria.

The Global Exchange Market is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II (as defined herein). There can be no assurance that any such listing will be maintained. Euronext Dublin has approved this document as listing particulars.

Legal Entity Identifier (“LEI”)
The Issuer’s LEI is 2138006IJX5FOJF25485.
Consents and Authorisations
The Issuer has obtained all necessary consents, approvals and authorisations in Ireland (if any) in connection with the issue and performance of the Notes. The issue of the Notes was authorised by resolutions of the board of Directors of the Issuer passed on or about 30 October 2020.
No Significant or Material Change
There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 26 August 2019 and there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 26 August 2019.
No Litigation
The Issuer is not involved, and has not been involved, in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer is aware) which may have or have had since the date of its incorporation a significant effect on the Issuer’s financial position or profitability.
Accounts
Since the date of its incorporation, other than entering into certain documentation, without any net assets or liabilities for the Issuer relating to a transaction which did not proceed, the Issuer has not commenced operations other than (if applicable) in respect of any warehouse agreements, any asset/forward sale or purchase agreements or trade confirmations which may be entered into in respect of the acquisition of (or commitment to acquire) certain assets to be comprised in the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and has not produced accounts.
So long as any Note remains outstanding, copies of the most recent annual audited financial statements of the Issuer can be obtained at the specified offices of the Issuer during normal business hours. The first financial statements of the Issuer will be in respect of the period from incorporation to 31 December 2020. The annual accounts of the Issuer will be audited. The Issuer will not prepare interim financial statements.
The Trust Deed requires the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee on an annual basis and otherwise promptly on request that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) or other matter which is required to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
Documents Available
Copies of the following documents may be inspected in electronic format (and, in the case of each of (c) and (d) below, will be available for collection free of charge) at the registered offices of Issuer during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for the term of the Notes:
(a) the Constitution of the Issuer;
(b) the Corporate Services Agreement;
(c) each Monthly Report;
(d) each Payment Date Report;
(e) the Trust Deed (which includes the form of each Note of each Class);
(f) the Agency Agreement;

(i) the Irish Security Agreement; and
(j) this Offering Circular.
Drafts of the documents set out above at paragraphs (e) to (j) will be made available on a secured website maintained by Collateral Administrator prior to the pricing date for the transaction described herein. Copies of the final form of such documents shall be available on such website on the Issue Date.
Enforceability of Judgments
The Issuer is a designated activity company incorporated under the laws of Ireland. None of the Directors are residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United States courts judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States.
As the U.S. is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the U.S. courts is enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the U.S. courts will be enforced by the courts of Ireland if the following general requirements are met:
(a) the U.S. courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and
(b) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where, however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.
However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the U.S. courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:
(i) the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;
(ii) the judgment was obtained by fraud;
(iii) the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice;
(iv) the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain U.S. laws which will not be enforced in Ireland;
(v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules;
(vi) there is no practical benefit to the party in whose favour the foreign judgment is made in seeking to have that judgment enforced in Ireland;
(vii) the judgment is inconsistent with a judgment of the courts of Ireland in relation to the same matter; or
(viii) enforcement proceedings are not instituted in Ireland within six years of the date of the judgment.
Foreign Language
The language of the Offering Circular is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been cited in their original language in order that the correct meaning may be ascribed to them under applicable law.

ANNEX A
FORM OF ERISA CERTIFICATE
The purpose of this ERISA Certificate (this “Certificate”) is, among other things, to (i) endeavour to ensure that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by class) issued by Bastille Euro CLO 2020-3 DAC (the “Issuer”) is held by (a) an employee benefit plan that is subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (b) a plan to which Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applies or (c) an entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity (collectively, “Benefit Plan Investors”), (ii) obtain from you certain representations and agreements and (iii) provide you with certain related information with respect to your acquisition, holding or disposition of [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes]. By signing this Certificate, you agree to be bound by its terms.
Please be aware that the information contained in this Certificate is not intended to constitute advice and the examples given below are not intended to be, and are not, comprehensive. You should contact your own counsel if you have any questions in completing this Certificate. Capitalised terms not defined in this Certificate shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Trust Deed.
By checking a box, you are representing, warranting and agreeing as to your status for so long as you hold a Note or interest therein.
If a box is not checked, you are representing and agreeing that the applicable Section does not, and will not, apply to you.
1. ☐ Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code.
Examples: (i) tax qualified retirement plans such as pension, profit sharing and Section 401(k) plans, (ii) welfare benefit plans such as accident, life and medical plans, (iii) individual retirement accounts or “IRAs” and “Keogh” plans and (iv) certain tax–qualified educational and savings trusts.
2. ☐ Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in such entity.
Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and (iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the total value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.
If you check Box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code: per cent.
AN ENTITY OR FUND THAT CANNOT PROVIDE THE FOREGOING PERCENTAGE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS OWN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT. OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF [CLASS E NOTES] [CLASS F NOTES] [SUBORDINATED NOTES], 100 PER CENT. OF THE ASSETS OF THE ENTITY OR FUND WILL BE TREATED AS “PLAN ASSETS”.
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section 2, you should consult with your counsel.
3. ☐ Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the [Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes] with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company’s corporate investment
portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute “plan assets” for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3–101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”).
If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(c) of ERISA for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent. test under the Plan Asset Regulations: per cent. IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERCENTAGE IN THE BLANK SPACE, YOU WILL BE COUNTED AS IF YOU FILLED IN 100 PER CENT. IN THE BLANK SPACE.
4. ☐ None of Sections (1) Through (3) Above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections (1) through
(3) above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer of such change.
5. No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) to (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
6. Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a violation of any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
7. ☐ Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Collateral Manager,
(ii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (iv) any “affiliate” of any of the above persons. “Affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a “Controlling Person”.
Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes], the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.
8. Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:
(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer may, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or our interests therein) to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder within ten calendar days after the date of such notice;
(ii) if we fail to transfer our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or our interests therein), the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] or our interests in the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;
(iii) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] and selling such securities (or interests therein) to the highest
such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;
(iv) by our acceptance of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or any interest therein), we agree to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers;
(v) the proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to us; and
(vi) the terms and conditions of any sale under this sub-section shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to us as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
9. Continuing Representation; Reliance. We acknowledge and agree that the representations, warranties, acknowledgements and agreements contained in this Certificate shall be deemed made on each day from the date we make such representations, warranties, acknowledgements and agreements through and including the date on which we dispose of our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or our interests therein). We understand and agree that the information supplied in this Certificate will be used and relied upon by the Issuer to determine that Benefit Plan Investors own or hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] upon any subsequent transfer of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] in accordance with the Trust Deed.
10. Further Acknowledgement and Agreement. We acknowledge and agree that (i) all of the representations, warranties, acknowledgments, agreements and assurances contained in this Certificate are for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger and the Collateral Manager as third party beneficiaries hereof, (ii) copies of this Certificate and any information contained herein may be provided to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Placement Agent, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, affiliates of any of the foregoing parties and to each of the foregoing parties’ respective counsel for purposes of making the determinations described above and (iii) any acquisition or transfer of [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or any interest therein) by us that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate shall be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.
11. Future Transfer Requirements.

Transferee Letter and its Delivery. We acknowledge and agree that we may not transfer any [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (or any interest therein) to any person unless the Issuer has received a certificate substantially in the form of this Certificate. Any attempt to transfer in violation of this section will be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.

For the purposes of the above,
“S&P Recovery Rating” means, in respect to a Collateral Obligation for which an S&P Recovery Rate is being determined, the “Recovery Rating” assigned by S&P to such Collateral Obligation based upon the tables set forth in this Annex B (S&P Recovery Rates).
“S&P Cov-Lite Loan” means a Collateral Obligation that is an interest in a loan, the Underlying Instruments for which do not (i) contain any financial covenants or (ii) require the Obligor thereunder to comply with any maintenance covenant (regardless of whether compliance with one or more incurrence covenants is otherwise required by such Underlying Instruments).
“S&P Secured Senior Bond” means a Collateral Obligation that is a senior secured debt security in the form of, or represented by, a bond, note, certificated debt security or other debt security (that is not a Secured Senior Loan) as determined by the Collateral Manager in its reasonable business judgement or a Participation therein, provided that:
(a) it is secured (i) by assets of the Obligor thereof if and to the extent that the provision of security over assets is permissible under applicable law (save in the case of assets where the failure to take such security is consistent with reasonable secured lending practices), or (ii) by at least 80 per cent. of the equity interests in the shares of an entity owning, either directly or indirectly, such assets; and
(b) no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or shares referred to in paragraph (a) above provided that revolving loans of the Obligor that, pursuant to their terms, may require one or more future advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security
interest in such assets or shares in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loans representing up to 20 per cent. in aggregate of the Obligor’s senior debt.
“S&P Secured Senior Loan” means a Collateral Obligation (which may be a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation) that is a senior secured loan obligation as determined by the Collateral Manager in its reasonable business judgement or a Participation therein, provided that:
(a) it is secured (i) by assets of the Obligor thereof if and to the extent that the provision of security over assets is permissible under applicable law (save in the case of assets where the failure to take such security is consistent with reasonable secured lending practices), or (ii) by at least 80 per cent. of the equity interests in the shares of an entity owning, either directly or indirectly, such assets; and
(b) no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or shares referred to in paragraph (a) above provided that revolving loans of the Obligor that, pursuant to their terms, may require one or more future advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or shares in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loans representing up to 20 per cent. in aggregate of the Obligor’s senior debt.

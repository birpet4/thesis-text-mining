OCP Euro CLO 2020-4 Designated Activity Company (the "Issuer") will issue the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (each as defined herein) on or about 24 June 2020 (the "Issue Date").
The Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (such Classes, the "Rated Notes" and together with the Subordinated Notes are collectively referred to herein as the "Notes"). The Notes will be issued and secured pursuant to a trust deed (the "Trust Deed") dated on or about Issue Date, made between (amongst others) the Issuer and Citibank N.A., London Branch in its capacity as trustee (the "Trustee").
Interest on the Notes will be payable (i) quarterly in arrear on 22 January, 22 April, 22 July and 22 October at any time other than following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event (as defined herein); and (ii) semi-annually in arrear following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event on (A) 22 January and 22 July (where the Payment Date immediately prior to the occurrence of the relevant Frequency Switch Event is in either January or July), or (B) 22 April and 22 October (where the Payment Date immediately prior to the occurrence of the relevant Frequency Switch Event is in either April or October), commencing on 22 January 2021 and ending on the Maturity Date (as defined herein) (subject to any earlier redemption of the Notes and in each case subject to adjustment for non-Business Days in accordance with the Conditions and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment).
The Notes will be subject to Optional Redemption, Mandatory Redemption and Special Redemption, each as described herein. See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).
See the section titled "Risk Factors" herein for a discussion of certain factors to be considered in connection with an investment in the Notes.
This Offering Circular does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of Article 6 of Regulation 2017/1129 (as may be amended or superseded from time to time), (the "Prospectus Regulation"). The Issuer is not offering the Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances that would require a prospectus to be prepared pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Application has been made to Euronext Dublin for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List (the "Official List") and trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin (the "Global Exchange Market"). There can be no assurance that any listing and admission to trading will be maintained. This Offering Circular will constitute listing particulars for the purpose of such application and has been approved by Euronext Dublin.
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer which are payable solely out of amounts received by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Collateral (as defined herein). The net proceeds of the realisation of the security over the Collateral upon acceleration of the Notes following a Note Event of Default (as defined herein) may be insufficient to pay all amounts due on the Notes after making payments to other creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority thereto or pari passu therewith. In the event of a shortfall in such proceeds, the Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets (including the Irish Excluded Assets (as defined herein)) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall, all claims in respect of such shortfall will be extinguished. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).
The Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and will be offered only: (a) outside the United States to non-"U.S. persons" acquiring the Notes in an "offshore transaction" (as such terms are defined in, and in accordance with, Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation S")); and (b) within the United States to persons and outside the United States to "U.S. persons" (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act ("U.S. Persons")), in each case, who are both qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A")) in reliance on Rule 144A and qualified purchasers for the purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). The Issuer will not be registered under the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See the sections titled "Plan of Distribution" and "Transfer Restrictions".
The Notes are being issued at a maximum issue price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount thereof. The Notes are being offered by the Issuer through Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited in its capacity as initial purchaser of the offering of
the Notes (the "Initial Purchaser") subject to prior sale, when, as and if delivered to and accepted by the Initial Purchaser, and to certain conditions. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made on or about the Issue Date. The Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and be different to the issue price of the Notes.

EU RETENTION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the EU Retention Requirements, the Originator will undertake, to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator in the Retention Undertaking Letter amongst other matters, to acquire and hold, on an ongoing basis, and for so long as any Notes are Outstanding, Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount Outstanding as of the Issue Date equal to not less than five per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (as defined herein) (such Subordinated Notes being the "Retention Notes"), as further described in "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements".
In respect of the EU Disclosure Requirements: (i) the Issuer will undertake to be designated as the entity required to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities the reports and information necessary to fulfil the reporting requirements thereunder, (ii) subject to any confidentiality obligations under law, regulation or contract binding upon it, the Portfolio Manager (subject to the Standard of Care under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) will undertake to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all reports, data and other information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer as the reporting entity of such reporting obligations and (iii) the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager shall propose to the Collateral Administrator in writing the form, content, timing and manner of publication of any such reports and information for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Portfolio Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the competent authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Collateral Administrator provides such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer's obligations as the entity responsible to fulfil reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements. In providing such information and reporting, neither the Collateral Administrator (nor any other person) assumes any responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use and/or onward disclosure of such information and reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports or documents provided or to be provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements or any other regulatory requirement to which they may be subject. Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Circular to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy or otherwise comply with the requirements of the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements, other than as set out above. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain.
See the sections titled "Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives – EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements", "Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives – EU Disclosure Requirements" and "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements" below.
U.S. CREDIT RISK RETENTION
PURSUANT TO THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES, THE SPONSOR IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE OR CAUSE TO BE DISCLOSED TO INVESTORS THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION OF THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR TITLED "U.S. CREDIT RISK RETENTION". SUCH FAIR
VALUE DETERMINATION MUST INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OR WOULD BE MATERIAL TO A PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR'S ABILITY TO EVALUATE SUCH FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS. IN ADOPTING THE U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES, THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITIES INDICATED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION IS TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO ANALYSE THE AMOUNT OF THE SPONSOR'S ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION SET FORTH HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES.
Except to the limited extent set forth in the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention" under the heading "Post Closing Update", neither the Portfolio Manager nor any of its affiliates has undertaken, and none of them is under any obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw the information set out in the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention". Although certain U.S. regulators may be entitled to take enforcement or other action against a sponsor that fails to comply with its obligations under the
U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such rules do not appear to establish any rights of investors or other parties against the sponsor or any person for any failure to comply with such rules, and each of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator and their respective affiliates expressly disclaims any responsibility to investors and such other parties with respect to compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. In the event that the Portfolio Manager at any time is determined not to be in compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such determination may materially adversely affect the Portfolio Manager, the Issuer and the Notes.
Each recipient of this Offering Circular, to the extent it considers the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to be relevant to its decision to invest, should independently assess and determine the sufficiency, for the purposes of complying with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, of the information set forth in this Offering Circular, and should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and with respect to any other related requirements of which it is uncertain. By purchasing any Notes, each Noteholder will be deemed to have represented that, as a sophisticated investor, it has reviewed the disclosures in the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention" and understands the limitations of the methodologies set forth therein and will make its own determination with respect to the fair value of any Notes it purchases.
VOLCKER RULE
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the "Volcker Rule") relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.
An "ownership interest" is broadly defined and may arise through a holder's exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.
The Issuer may be deemed to be a "covered fund" under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. "banking entities" and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a "covered fund", this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Notes.
It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Portfolio Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.
The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Portfolio Manager and selection of a replacement portfolio manager shall only be exercisable upon a Portfolio Manager Event of Default. The holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C
Notes and the Class D Notes in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an "ownership interest" in the Issuer.
In addition, on 30 January 2020, the five regulators responsible for the enforcement of the Volcker Rule published proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule (the "Proposed Volcker Changes") that would, among other things, exclude from the definition of "ownership interest" certain senior loans or senior debt interests issued by covered fund. If adopted, the Proposed Volcker Changes may mean that certain of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes would not be considered an "ownership interest". This would be the case regardless of whether such holders of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes are held in the form of PM Voting Notes, PM Non- Voting Notes or PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes. There can be no assurances that the Proposed Volcker Changes will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all.
There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule's prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Notes. Any entity that is a "banking entity" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally. Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger, makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Notes, now or at any time in the future. See the sections titled "Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Volcker Rule" below for further information.
Information as to placement within the United States
The Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A") (the "Rule 144A Notes") will be sold only to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A) ("QIBs") that are also "qualified purchasers" for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act ("QPs"). Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a "Rule 144A Global Certificate" and together, the "Rule 144A Global Certificates") or may in some cases be represented by definitive certificates of such Class (each a "Rule 144A Definitive Certificate" and, together the "Rule 144A Definitive Certificates"), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg"), or, in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes) sold outside the United States to non-"U.S. persons" in an "offshore transaction", as such terms are defined in, and in accordance with Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act (the "Regulation S Notes") will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a "Regulation S Global Certificate" and together, the "Regulation S Global Certificates") or may in some cases be represented by definitive certificates of such Class (each a "Regulation S Definitive Certificate" and, together the "Regulation S Definitive Certificates"), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof.

1 Applicable to each three month Accrual Period, provided that the rate of interest of the Rated Notes (other than the Class B-2 Notes) will be determined for the period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the first Payment Date, by reference to a straight line interpolation of 6 EURIBOR and 12 EURIBOR.
2 Applicable at all times following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, provided that the rate of interest of the Rated Notes (other than the Class B-2 Notes) of each Class for the period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date will, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls in January 2021, be determined by reference to 6 EURIBOR.
3 The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal.

Frequency Switch
Event

(a)

the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Frequency Switch Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) in respect of such Frequency Switch Measurement Date is equal to or greater than 20 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (excluding Defaulted Obligations);


(b)

the ratio (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing:


(i) the sum of:


(A) the aggregate of scheduled and projected interest (and any commitment fees in respect of any Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations, but excluding any scheduled interest payments in respect of Defaulted Obligations as to which the Portfolio Manager has actual knowledge that such payment will not be made) which will be due to be paid on each Collateral Obligation during the immediately following Due Period (which, in the case of each Non-Euro Obligation, to the extent that a related Currency Hedge Agreement is in place, shall be converted into Euro at the applicable Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate for the related Currency Hedge Transaction and, to the extent that no related Currency Hedge Agreement is in place, shall be converted into Euro at the Spot Rate) minus any Interest Smoothing Amounts that would be payable into the Interest Smoothing Account on the Business Day after the Determination Date at the end of the Due Period in which such Measurement Date falls; and


(B) the Balance standing to the credit of the Interest Smoothing Account on such
Frequency Switch Measurement Date; by

is less than 120.0 per cent.; and

(c) the sum of:

(ii) the aggregate of scheduled and projected interest payments (and any commitment fees in respect of Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations) which will be accrued but not yet paid as at the Business Day being three months following such Frequency Switch Measurement Date in respect of each Frequency Switch Obligation (which, in the case of each Non-Euro Obligation, to the extent that a related Currency Hedge Agreement is in place, shall be converted into Euro at the applicable Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate for the related Currency Hedge Transaction and, to the extent that no related Currency Hedge Agreement is in place, shall be converted into Euro at the Spot Rate),

is equal to or greater than the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(ii) above, with the projected interest amounts described above being calculated in respect of such Frequency Switch Measurement Date on the basis of the following assumptions:

(X) in respect of each Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, projected interest payable on such Floating Rate Collateral Obligation on each future payment date thereunder during the immediately following Due Period shall be determined based on the applicable base rate and applicable margin pursuant to the relevant Underlying Instrument as determined as at such Frequency Switch Measurement Date;

(Y). the frequency of interest payments on each Collateral Obligation shall not change following such Frequency Switch Measurement Date; and

(Z). EURIBOR for the purposes of calculating Interest Amounts in respect of the Class A Notes and the Class B-1 Notes at all times following such Determination Date shall be equal to

Interest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes on each Payment Date to the extent funds are available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.

Non Payment and Deferral of Interest
................................................................

Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment shall not be a Note Event of Default unless and until such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days save, in the case of administrative error or omission only, where such failure continues for a period of at least 10 Business Days, and in each case, save as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of any withholding tax thereon as set out in Condition 9 (Taxation).


Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment will not constitute a Note Event of Default. To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes are not made on the relevant Payment Date, an amount equal to such unpaid interest will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes (as applicable), and from the date such unpaid interest is added to the applicable Principal Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class of Notes, such unpaid amount will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to the relevant Class of Notes. See Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest).


Non-payment of amounts due and payable on the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds will not constitute a Note Event of Default.

0.15 per cent. per annum of the Collateral Principal Amount (exclusive of VAT). See "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement — Compensation of the Portfolio Manager".

Subordinated Management Fee
................................................................

0.20 per cent. per annum of the Collateral Principal Amount (exclusive of VAT). See "Description of the Portfolio




Management and Administration Agreement — Compensation of the Portfolio Manager".

Incentive Portfolio Management Fee
................................................................

The Portfolio Manager will be entitled to an Incentive Portfolio Management Fee on each Payment Date on which the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed, equal (exclusive of VAT) to 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. See "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement — Compensation of the Portfolio Manager".

Security for the Notes
................................................................

The Notes will be secured in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties by security over, inter alia, a portfolio of Collateral Obligations. The Notes will also be secured by an assignment by way of security of various of the Issuer's other rights, including its rights under certain of the agreements described herein but excluding its rights in respect of amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Profit Account (including the Issuer's rights under the Issuer Profit Account Documentation) and the Issuer Corporate Services Agreement (the "Irish Excluded Assets"). See Condition 4 (Security).

Hedge Arrangements
................................................................

Subject to the Eligibility Criteria, the Issuer may purchase Collateral Obligations that are denominated in a currency other than Euro (each, a "Non-Euro Obligation") provided that, subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, a Currency Hedge Transaction is entered into in respect of each such Non-Euro Obligation with one or more Currency Hedge Counterparties satisfying the applicable Rating Requirement under which the currency risk is reduced or eliminated, no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation. Under each Currency Hedge Transaction, the currency risk arising from the receipt of certain cash flows from the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, including interest and principal payments thereon, are hedged. The Currency Hedge Transaction shall terminate on the maturity date of the Non-Euro Obligation and in the other circumstances specified therein.


For the avoidance of doubt, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions is subject to satisfaction of the Hedging Condition. The Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is also authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer's payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction.


On or around the Issue Date, the Issuer may enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions which are interest rate caps ("Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions") with one or more Interest Rate Hedge Counterparties in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in EURIBOR-based payments of interest payable by the Issuer on the Rated Notes. Should the Issuer enter into such transactions on the Issue Date, the Issuer will pay a premium to such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty or Interest Rate Hedge Counterparties. The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) would be required to exercise such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions if at any time EURIBOR was greater than the strike price set out in the applicable Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge
Transaction. The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) would be permitted to sell or otherwise transfer for value any Issue




Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction on any date (a) upon which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in whole; or (b) upon receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation. See "Hedging Arrangements".


The Issuer will obtain Rating Agency Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless it is a Form Approved Hedge. See "Hedging Arrangements".

Portfolio Manager
................................................................

Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager is required to act as the Issuer's Portfolio Manager with respect to the Portfolio, to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described therein. Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer delegates authority to the Portfolio Manager to carry out certain functions in relation to the Portfolio and any Hedge Transactions. See "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement" and "The Portfolio".


Pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements, the Portfolio Manager has selected the collateral obligations under the Warehouse Arrangements and has independently reviewed and assessed each such collateral obligation. The Issuer has entered into binding commitments to acquire Collateral Obligations on or before the Issue Date such that the Originator Requirement is expected to be satisfied on the Issue Date. See "Risk Factors - Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date" and "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements".

Purchase and Sale of Collateral Obligations

Subject to the limits described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and Principal Proceeds being available for such purpose, the Portfolio Manager shall, on behalf of the Issuer, use reasonable endeavours to purchase Substitute Collateral Obligations meeting the Eligibility Criteria and the Reinvestment Criteria during the Reinvestment Period.


Following expiry of the Reinvestment Period, only Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations or Credit Improved Obligations and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received after the Reinvestment Period may, but are not required to, be reinvested by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, in Substitute Collateral Obligations meeting the Eligibility Criteria and Reinvestment Criteria and subject to certain other restrictions. See "The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio".

Eligibility Criteria
................................................................

In order to qualify as a Collateral Obligation, an obligation must satisfy certain specified Eligibility Criteria. Each obligation shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such obligation save for an Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must also satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date. See "The Portfolio — Eligibility Criteria".

Restructured Obligations
................................................................

In order for a Collateral Obligation which is the subject of a restructuring to qualify as a Restructured Obligation, such Collateral Obligation must satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria as at the applicable Restructuring Date. See "The Portfolio
- Restructured Obligations".

Collateral Quality
Tests
................................................................

The Collateral Quality Tests will comprise the following:


For so long as any of the Notes are rated by S&P and are Outstanding (as of the Effective Date and until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only), the S&P CDO Monitor Test;


For so long as any of the Notes are rated by Fitch and are Outstanding:


(a) the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test;

(b) the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test; and


(c) the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test;


For so long as any of the Rated Notes are Outstanding the Weighted Average Life Test.


For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Collateral Quality Tests referred to above shall be applied by reference to Collateral Obligations excluding any Defaulted Obligations.

The Regulation S Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, as described below) will be represented on issue by one or more Regulation S Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. a nominee of, as operator of the Euroclear System ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking société anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg"). Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may at any time only be held only through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See "Form of the Notes" and "Book Entry Clearance Procedures". Interests in any Regulation S Note may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.


The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, as described below) will be represented on issue by one or more Rule 144A Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may at any time only be held through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See "Form of the Notes" and "Book Entry Clearance Procedures".


The Rule 144A Global Certificates and Regulation S Global Certificates will bear a legend and such Rule 144A Global
Certificates and Regulation S Global Certificates, or any interest therein, may not be transferred except in compliance with the



transfer restrictions set out in such legend. See "Transfer Restrictions".

No beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery thereof through a Regulation S Global Certificate unless the transferor provides the Transfer Agent with a written certification substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed regarding compliance with certain of such transfer restrictions. Any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate to a person who takes delivery through an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate is also subject to certification requirements substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed and each purchaser thereof shall be deemed to represent that such purchaser is a QIB/QP. In addition, interests in any of the Regulation S Notes may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident. See "Form of the Notes" and "Book Entry Clearance Procedures".

Except in the limited circumstances described herein, Notes in definitive, certificated, fully registered form ("Definitive Certificates") will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in either the Regulation S Global Certificates or the Rule 144A Global Certificates. See "Form of the Notes - Exchange for Definitive Certificates".

Each initial investor (other than the Initial Purchaser) in: (a) any Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in the form of Rule 144A Notes, (b) any Subordinated Notes in the form of Regulation S Notes or (c) any Class E Notes or Class F Notes in the form of Regulation S Notes represented by a Regulation S Definitive Certificate, purchased on the Issue Date will be required to enter into a Subscription Agreement with the Initial Purchaser in which such investor will certify as to, among other matters, its status under the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA.

Each initial investor and each transferee of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes shall be required or deemed to represent, warrant and agree (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, (and for so long as it holds such Note or an interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, an investor that is or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person may acquire such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or any interest therein) if such transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and (iii) either (A) acquires such interest in the form of a Definitive Certificate or (B) is a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person that purchases the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date or is the Originator, and acquires such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate. No proposed purchase or transfer of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein), in any form, will be permitted or recognised if a purchase or transfer to a transferee will
cause 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by




each class) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors, disregarding Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein) held by Controlling Persons, as determined under ERISA and applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulations. See "Certain ERISA Considerations".


Transfers of interests in the Notes are subject to certain restrictions and must be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Trust Deed. See "Form of the Notes", "Book Entry Clearance Procedures" and "Transfer Restrictions". Each purchaser of Notes in making its purchase will be required to make, or will be deemed to have made, certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See "Transfer Restrictions". The transfer of Notes in breach of certain of such representations and agreements will result in affected Notes becoming subject to certain forced transfer provisions. See Condition 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), Condition 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA).

Governing Law
................................................................

The Notes, the Trust Deed, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement and all other Transaction Documents (save for the Issuer Corporate Services Agreement and the Share Charge, which are governed by the laws of Ireland) will be governed by English law.

Listing
................................................................

Application has been made to Euronext Dublin for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and trading on its Global Exchange Market. There can be no assurance that any listing and admission to trading will be maintained. See "General Information".

Tax Status
................................................................

See "Tax Considerations".

Certain ERISA
Considerations
................................................................

See "Certain ERISA Considerations".

Withholding Tax
................................................................

The Issuer will not gross-up any payments to the Noteholders in respect of amounts deducted from or withheld for or on account of tax in relation to the Notes. See Condition 9 (Taxation).

Additional Issuances
................................................................

Subject to certain conditions being met (including the prior written approval of the Originator), additional notes of all existing Classes or of the Subordinated Notes may be issued and sold. In addition, the Originator may direct the Issuer to issue additional subordinated notes where necessary in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).


Additional notes that are not fungible with original Notes for U.S. federal tax purposes will be issued with a separate securities identifier.

EU Retention
Requirements
................................................................

The Retention Notes will be purchased by the Originator from the Issuer on the Issue Date and, pursuant to the Retention Undertaking Letter, the Originator will undertake to retain the Retention Notes, with the intention of complying with the EU Retention Requirements. See "Description of Origination and the EU
Retention and Disclosure Requirements", "Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence




Requirements" and "Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)".

Credit Risk
Retention
................................................................

The U.S. Risk Retention Rules require the "sponsor" of a "securitization transaction" to acquire (either directly or through its "majority-owned affiliates") not less than 5% of the "credit risk" of "securitized assets" (as such terms are defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules). To this end, the "sponsor" may acquire an "eligible vertical interest" or an "eligible horizontal residual interest" (as such terms are defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules), or any combination thereof. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules further prohibit the "sponsor" or its "majority-owned affiliates," as applicable, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the "credit risk" that it is required to retain during the period specified under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.


For purposes of this transaction, the Portfolio Manager is considered to be the "sponsor" for purposes of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.


The Portfolio Manager has informed the Issuer that the Originator (a "majority-owned affiliate" of the Portfolio Manager) will, on the Issue Date purchase, and intends to hold for as long as is required by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, Subordinated Notes in an amount equal to at least 5 per cent. of the "fair value" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) as of the Issue Date of all Notes issued on the Issue Date as an "eligible horizontal residual interest" (as such term is defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) (the "U.S. Retention Interest").


The statements contained in this Offering Circular regarding compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules are solely based on the U.S. Risk Retention Rules as published in the federal register as of the date of this Offering Circular.

See "Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives―Risk Retention and
Due Diligence Requirements - U.S. Risk Retention Rules" and the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention".



RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral Obligations securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. The following risk factors are applicable to an investment in the Notes. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".

1. GENERAL COMMERCIAL RISKS

1.1 General
It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets) with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in "The Portfolio". There can be no assurance that the Issuer's investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment) and Condition 11(b) (Enforcement). In particular, (i) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the other Classes of Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes.
None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager or the Originator or any of their respective Affiliates during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular, the Monthly Reports or the Payment Date Reports, as the case may be.
In preparing and furnishing the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager and third parties) (and reviewed by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.
In addition, the information contained in the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports will be dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by or on behalf of the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager. The accuracy of the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, and the information included therein, will therefore be subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on behalf of the Portfolio Manager).
1.2 Suitability
Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access
to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.
1.3 Limited Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer
The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified and or pre funded and/or secured.
1.4 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer's
Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if there are market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.
1.5 General Economic Conditions may Deteriorate and may Affect the Ability of the Issuer to make Payments on the Notes
European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the "Member States"), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.
As discussed further in 1.7 "European Union and Euro Zone Risk", it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.
In addition, Obligors of Collateral Obligations may be organised in, or otherwise Domiciled in, certain of such countries currently suffering from economic distress, or other countries that may begin to suffer economic distress, and the uncertainty and market instability in any such country may increase the likelihood of default by such Obligor. If any such Obligor becomes insolvent, by virtue of being organised in such a jurisdiction or having a substantial percentage of its revenues or assets in such a jurisdiction, it may be more likely to be subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in such jurisdiction at the same time as such jurisdiction is itself potentially unstable.
Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis and the ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loans arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs may be partially or significantly limited.
As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. A continuing decreased ability of obligors to obtain refinancing may result in an economic decline causing a deterioration in loan performance generally and defaults of Collateral Obligations. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager acting on behalf of the Portfolio Manager) to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.
Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation ("CLO") transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.
The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non- performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.
The global credit crisis and its consequences, together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager acting on behalf of the Portfolio Manager) in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)) recently emerged in China and has spread to many countries throughout the world, including the US, UK and several other European countries to the extent that the World Health Organisation declared that the outbreak constituted a pandemic. The pandemic has led (and may continue to lead) to disruptions in the economies of regions or nations where the novel coronavirus has arisen (including China, the US and the UK) and may in the future arise. The pandemic has seen a number of regions and countries take steps to impose lockdowns which include restrictions on commercial activity and travel. Such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains, and adversely impacting a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. It is impossible to determine the scope of this pandemic and any future trajectory thereof and the impact of the same on the Notes. This pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy in general, including volatility in or disruption of the credit markets, which could have a material adverse impact on the Issuer and the Issuer's performance and financial results, creditworthiness of the Obligors in respect of the Collateral Obligations, the ability of the Issuer to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations and on the secondary trading market for the Notes. In addition, there can be no assurance that, as a result of deterioration of the creditworthiness of the Obligors and/or the impact on the economies affected by the novel coronavirus, a rating (including any
proposed Initial Rating assigned to any Class of Rated Notes and/or the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations, such ratings being downgraded prior to the Issue Date) assigned to any of Class of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time and, such rating may be downgraded at any time by the Rating Agencies, the impact of which includes, but is not limited to, the designation of an Effective Date Rating Event.
1.6 Illiquidity in the Collateralised Debt Obligation, Leveraged Finance and Fixed Income Markets may Affect the Noteholders
In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer's ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer's inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price,
(ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk
Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.
As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the "EFSF") and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the "EFSM") to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.
Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe, which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.
Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the imposition of capital controls, the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.
1.8 Referendum on the UK's EU Membership
On 31 January 2020 the UK formally withdrew from the EU following which, and in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (the "Withdrawal Act"), the UK has entered into a transition period which will last until 31 December 2020. The Withdrawal Act has transported existing EU rules and regulations on to the UK domestic statute book and therefore such EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK during the transition period whilst negotiations with respect to a future relationship between the EU and the UK take place.
It remains uncertain to what extent the UK and EU will be able to finalise negotiation of a future trading relationship ahead of 31 December 2020. The transition period may be extended once by up to two years. Investors should be aware that the Issuer's risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.
Applicability of EU law in the UK

It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established following the transition period, or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.
Upon any agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law may cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of any future agreement, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Regulatory Risk

Currently, under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EU and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one jurisdiction in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or the UK may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries in reliance on passporting rights and without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to whether, following the settlement of a future relationship between the UK and the EU or the EEA (whatever the form thereof), a passporting regime (or similar regime in its effect) will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of any future replacement relationship, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.
There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK's future trading agreement will include arrangements for the continuation of a passporting regime (or similar regime in its effect) or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Market Risk

Following the results of the referendum with respect to the UK's membership of the EU on 23 June 2016 (the "Referendum") and throughout the negotiations between the UK and the EU, the financial markets
have experienced volatility and disruption and this volatility and disruption is expected to continue until the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU is agreed. As such, investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.
Investors should be aware that any negotiation between the UK and the EU with respect to their future relationship may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. Such uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Exposure to Counterparties

The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that following the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the end of the transition period and depending on the terms of any future relationship between the UK and the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from a failure of the UK to conclude agreed terms with the EU, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see
4.15 "Counterparty Risk" below.
Ratings actions

Following the result of the Referendum, S&P and Fitch have each downgraded the UK's sovereign credit rating and each of S&P, Fitch and Moody's has placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.
The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, such downgrades of the UK's sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.
While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see 4.15 "Counterparty Risk" below.
Currency exchange rates and exchange controls

Since the result of the Referendum there has been increased volatility in the currency exchange rates. This volatility is expected to continue until the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU is agreed, and potentially beyond. Investors should note that all payments on the Notes will be denominated in Euros. Investors who are investing in the Notes, but who consider their investment profile and return in another currency may incur a number of risks including those relating to changes in exchange rates (which may be significant). An appreciation in the value of the investor's currency relative to the Euro would result in a decrease of: (i) the investor's currency-equivalent yield on the Notes; (ii) the investor's currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes; and (iii) the investor's currency- equivalent market value of the Notes. See also 4.19 "Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions
– Currency Risk" below.
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available
Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company's direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that the Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer's net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Issuer Corporate Services Provider and for payment of the Issuer's other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to those amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests. In addition, service providers who are not paid in full, including the Directors, may have the right to resign. This could ultimately lead to the Issuer being in default under the applicable laws of Ireland and potentially being removed from the Register of Companies and dissolved.
Further, any award or recourse related thereto would be payable as "Administrative Expenses" solely from the Collateral Obligations and all other assets over which the Issuer has granted security to the Trustee for the benefit of holders of the Notes and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the Trust Deed. If distributions on such assets were insufficient to make payments on the Notes and such awards or recourse, no other assets (in particular, no assets of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) would be available for payment of the deficiency. Administrative Expenses of the Issuer are senior (but subject to a cap in most instances) to other amounts owing by the Issuer. If the Issuer were required to pay any such amounts it could reduce or eliminate the ability of the Issuer to make payments to the holders of the Notes.
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES
In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, "shadow banking entities" and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.
This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis creating the potential for conflict across jurisdictions. Investors should be aware that risks posed by such regulatory overlap and divergence are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes, could be materially and adversely affected thereby.
None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub- Manager, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences. Certain regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire the Notes, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the Notes who are not subject to those provisions to resell their Notes in the secondary market.
Regulations Affecting Investors

All investors whose investment activities are subject to investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities (including the introduction or proposal of risk retention rules) should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Originator and the Portfolio Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory or other framework, including as any such framework applies to any investor's investment in the Notes.
2.1 Basel III
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as "Basel III") and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio "backstop" for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR")). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the European Union (being Directive 2009/138/EC including any implementing and/or delegated regulation, technical standards and guidance related thereto as may be amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time).
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Agents, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their affiliates makes any representation or warranty to any such prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
2.2 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements
EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements

The Securitisation Regulation came into force on 1 January 2019 and applies to certain parties involved in the establishment of EU and UK regulated securitisations, the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019, and to certain institutional investors therein. It should be noted that securitisations established prior to the application date of 1 January 2019 which involve the creation of a new securitisation position may also be subject to the Securitisation Regulation. Among other things, the Securitisation Regulation includes provisions harmonising and replacing the risk retention and due diligence requirements (including the corresponding guidance provided through technical standards) applicable to such investors.
The Securitisation Regulation places a requirement on originators, sponsors and original lenders and securitisation special purpose entities established in the EU and UK ("SSPEs") to, amongst other things,
(i) retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 per
cent. and (ii) make certain information available to holders of a securitisation position, competent authorities and (upon request) potential investors in accordance with the transparency requirements set out therein. The Securitisation Regulation also places requirements on an institutional investor intending to invest in an EU or UK regulated securitisation to, amongst other things, (i) be able to demonstrate that such investor has carried out a due diligence assessment in respect of various matters including the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation and its underlying exposures, (ii) verify that the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes to ensure that credit- granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor's creditworthiness, (iii) ensure the originator, sponsor or original lender in respect of the relevant securitisation has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than 5 per cent. in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or asset exposures and (iv) ensure the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available to the investor certain information in accordance with the transparency requirements therein. See 2.4 "EU Disclosure Requirements".
Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties being imposed on the relevant investor, originator, sponsor, lender or SSPE (as applicable), which may be payable or reimbursable pursuant to the Transaction Documents by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses to the extent that pecuniary sanctions are imposed on the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager or the Originator. To the extent that a Portfolio Manager Party is indemnified by the Issuer, the assets of the Issuer will be reduced accordingly and such reduction may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remains unclear (particularly in respect of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, as to which see 2.4 "EU Disclosure Requirements"). Investors should therefore make themselves aware of such requirements (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Notes.
Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the Securitisation Regulation. Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Circular to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates nor any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy or otherwise comply with the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, the implementing provisions in respect of the Securitisation Regulation in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements, other than as set out above. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the Securitisation Regulation should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the Securitisation Regulation or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes.
The Securitisation Regulation and any other changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change (whether as a result of the legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission or otherwise), and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Originator does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention Requirements or in the interpretation thereof.
See further "Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives – EU Disclosure Requirements" and "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements" below.
U.S. Risk Retention Rules

On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "U.S. Risk Retention Rules" ) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a "sponsor" of asset-backed securities or its "majority-owned affiliate" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5 per cent. of the credit risk of the assets collateralising asset-backed securities (the "Minimum Risk Retention Requirement" ).
On 9 February 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favour of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (the "LSTA") in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that managers of so called "open market CLOs" are not "securitizers" under Section 941 of the Dodd Frank Act, are not subject to risk retention. The transaction described in this Offering Circular would not constitute an "open market CLO" for such purposes.
Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, a "sponsor" means a person who organises and initiates a securitisation transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuing entity. A sponsor (or its "majority-owned affiliate") is generally prohibited, prior to the end of the sunset period, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing such credit risk by hedging or otherwise transferring the retained credit risk.
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules provide several permissible forms through which a sponsor (or its "majority-owned affiliate") can satisfy the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement, including retaining an eligible vertical interest consisting of not less than 5% of the principal amount of each class of asset- backed securities ("ABS") issued in a securitisation transaction or retaining an eligible horizontal residual interest consisting of not less than 5% of the fair value of all ABS interests issued in a securitisation transaction, determined using a fair value measurement framework under U.S. GAAP.
The Originator will purchase an "eligible horizontal residual interest" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) on the Issue Date and will retain the "eligible horizontal residual interest" as long as required by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention".
A "majority-owned affiliate" means, among other things, an entity (other than the issuing entity) that is majority controlled by or is under common majority control with the "sponsor". For purposes of the definition, majority control means ownership of more than 50 per cent. of the equity of an entity, or ownership of any other controlling financial interest in the entity, as determined under U.S. GAAP. The Portfolio Manager and the Originator are at least 50 per cent. owned by the same ultimate parent entity and therefore the Originator meets the definition of "majority-owned affiliate". There can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager will be able to maintain the treatment of the Originator as a "majority-owned affiliate", including as a result of a change in GAAP regulations or interpretations over time.
The failure by the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may result in regulatory actions and other proceedings being brought against the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator, which could result in the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator being required, among other things, to pay damages, transfer interests and/or acquire additional Notes (which may or may not be available at such time for acquisition) or be subject to cease and desist orders or other regulatory action. In addition, a failure to remedy non-compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may also subject the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to adverse publicity and reputational risk resulting from such non-compliance. In addition, given the lack of clarity under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules with respect to the identity of the party responsible for holding the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement upon a removal of the Portfolio Manager, if the applicable Noteholders desire to remove the Portfolio Manager in connection with any such "cause" event, there may be no successor Portfolio Manager willing to accept appointment as such, in which case the Portfolio Manager will be required to continue to act as Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. As a result of any of the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio Manager and/or the Originator to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may have a material and adverse effect on the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes as well as on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, operations or prospects of the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager.
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules would apply to any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date or any Refinancing. In addition, the SEC has indicated in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that an "offer" and "sale" of securities may arise when amendments to securities are so material as to require holders to make an "investment decision" with respect to such securities. Thus, if the SEC were to take a similar position with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, they could apply to material amendments to the Trust Deed and the Notes, to the extent such amendments require investors to make a new investment decision with respect to the Notes. There is no assurance that the Notes purchased by the Originator on the Issue Date will be sufficient to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules in connection with any such additional issuance, Refinancing or other material amendment. With respect to the additional issuance of Notes in particular, it is a condition to such additional issuance that the Originator provide its prior written consent thereto. In granting or withholding such consent, it should be expected that the Originator will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Noteholders) and not consent to any of the foregoing actions if to do so might cause the Portfolio Manager to be in violation of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules or to have to increase the amount of Notes held by the Originator. As a result, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may adversely affect the Issuer (and the performance and market value of the Notes) if the Issuer is unable to undertake any such additional issuance, Refinancing or material amendment and may affect the liquidity of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will have any material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Portfolio Manager, the Issuer or the Noteholders.
The statements contained herein regarding the U.S. Risk Retention Rules are based on publicly available information solely as of the date of this Offering Circular. The ultimate interpretation as to whether any action taken by an entity complies with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will be a matter of interpretation by the applicable governmental authorities or regulators. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will not change or be superseded by changes in law. There is no established line of authority, precedent or market practice that provides guidance with respect to compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules in connection with any actions of the Issuer after the rule becomes effective. Moreover, any applicable governmental authority or regulator could provide guidance or state views on compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that materially alter current interpretations or views with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Any changes or further guidance may result in the Portfolio Manager failing to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Notes.
Estimated Fair Values

The estimated fair values of the Notes included in the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention", and the description of inputs and assumptions used to derive such estimated fair values, are forward-looking statements solely for purposes of satisfying the disclosure requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and should not be relied upon by any person for any other purpose, including for purposes of making an investment decision in the Notes or in assessing the value or future value of any of the Notes.
Specifically, for purposes of disclosures appearing in the section of this Offering Circular titled "U.S. Credit Risk Retention" the requirements for valuation set forth in Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" ("ASC 820"), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP have been applied. Because the Notes will be investments for which there is no, or a limited, liquid market, the fair value of the Notes may not be readily determinable. Accordingly, there is and can be no assurance that the value (or range of values) appearing in such section will accurately reflect the value that will be realised by holders upon the eventual disposition of the Notes.
Moreover, any value (or range of values) is only an estimate as of the calculation date, which is subject to uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and cannot be controlled. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially the information appearing in such section include the ultimate rating and pricing levels on the Notes, rates and timing of defaults, delinquencies, recoveries and prepayments on the Collateral Obligations, selection and trading of Collateral Obligations by the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on behalf of the Portfolio Manager), ongoing trading gains or losses, changes in interest rates or exchange rates, future reinvestment opportunities and timing of reinvestment, differences between the actual and assumed concentrations of Collateral Obligations, mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds on the Collateral
Obligations as well as market, financial and/or legal uncertainties. As a result, any such values (or range of values) are not intended to be, and should not be construed in any respect as, a guarantee of value or a statement as to the prices at which the Notes may actually be sold. For various reasons, the price at which Notes might be sold in a specific transaction between specific parties on a specific date may be significantly different than those set forth herein.
Prospective investors are advised that any information appearing in such section is not intended, and should not be construed, to be investment advice with respect to the merits of any Notes or the transactions described in this Offering Circular, the suitability of investing in any Notes or any investment decision being considered by any prospective investor, or a recommendation to buy or sell any Notes.
2.3 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Portfolio Manager in Order to Comply with Risk Retention
The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in 2.2 "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements" is that "institutional investors" as defined in the Securitisation Regulation should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation. The five per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the Collateral Principal Amount. The Originator has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding of not less than 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount.
Certain discretions of the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements" section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention Requirements.
In particular, if, at any time, the deposit of Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency, such Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments will instead be deposited into the Interest Account. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds if the reinvestment of such amount would, in the sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. See
4.30 "Recharacterisation of Trading Gains" below.
In addition, the Portfolio Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Obligations where such reinvestment would cause a Retention Deficiency. As a result, the Portfolio Manager may be prevented from reinvesting available proceeds in Collateral Obligations in circumstances where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise have been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.
Also, the Issuer may not issue further Notes without the Originator (a) consenting to such issuance and
(b) to the extent any such issuance would result in non-compliance by the Originator with the EU Retention Requirements.
As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.
2.4 EU Disclosure Requirements
Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation contains transparency requirements that require the originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation to make certain prescribed information relating to the securitisation available to investors, competent authorities and, upon request, to potential investors (the "Relevant Recipients").
Required Disclosure
Virtus Group LP, acting on behalf of the Issuer, has made drafts of the applicable documentation referred to in Articles 7(1)(b) and 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation (the "Pre-Pricing Draft Documents") available to the Relevant Recipients before pricing of the Notes via a secure website currently located at http://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by Virtus Group LP to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and the Portfolio Manager from time to time) or by such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as instructed by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf). Investors should note that the Pre-Pricing Draft Documents are subject to change and that on or after the Issue Date, each Pre-Pricing Draft Document will be replaced by the final or signed (as applicable) version of such document.
Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations to be undertaken by the originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation. This includes quarterly portfolio level disclosure ("Portfolio Reports") pursuant to Article 7(1)(a) of the Securitisation Regulation, quarterly investor reports containing certain information prescribed by Article 7(1)(e) of the Securitisation Regulation ("Investor Reports" and together with the Portfolio Reports, the "Transparency Reports"), any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation EU 596/2014) ("Inside Information") and any significant events in relation to the securitisation ("Significant Events").
The Transparency Reports are to be made available simultaneously, with the first publication within three months of the Issue Date. Thereafter, the Transparency Reports are to be made available on a quarterly basis within one month of each Payment Date (or following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, within 30 days of each date that would have been a Payment Date had the Frequency Switch Event not occurred). Any Inside Information and the notification of any Significant Event is required to be made available without delay.
The Securitisation Regulation provides for ESMA to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information required to be disclosed in respect of underlying exposures and quarterly investor reports. On 22 August 2018, ESMA published its final report (the "Final Report") on the technical standards on the disclosure requirements under Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation containing detailed draft regulatory technical standards and disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Transparency Reports, Inside Information and Significant Events (the "Article 7 RTS"). The European Commission has, at the date hereof, not adopted the Final Report, which includes the Article 7 RTS. The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Article 7 RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted the revised Article 7 RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019 and the European Commission adopted and published on 16 October 2019 the final version of the Article 7 RTS. Following the European Commission's adoption, the European Parliament and the Council now have a period of three months in which they may object to or approve the final version of the Article 7 RTS. If the European Parliament and the Council will approve the final version of the Article 7 RTS, it will be subsequently published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force on the 20th calendar day thereafter. The application date of the technical standards has not yet been specified.
In a statement on 30 November 2018, ESMA confirmed in a joint statement with the other European Supervisory Authorities that, as per the grandfathering provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the reporting obligations, until the regulatory technical standards relating to Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (the "Article 7 RTS") are adopted by the European Commission, for the purposes of the Transparency Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the "CRA3 RTS"). In their current form, the CRA3 RTS only apply to structured finance instruments for which a reporting template has been specified. Currently there is no loan level data template within such Annexes for CLO transactions nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS. On that basis, the Issuer believes that the transaction described herein will not be required to comply with the reporting obligations relating to the Transparency Reports until the Article 7 RTS are adopted and implemented (such date of implementation, the "Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date"). In any event, information regarding the underlying exposures will be provided prior to the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date in the Payment Date Reports and Monthly Reports, in each case as set out in "Description of the Reports" below, which in the Issuer's view is in line with the level of information typically provided to noteholders of European CLO transactions in the period immediately prior to 1 January 2019. In relation to Investor Reports prior to the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date, the CRA3
RTS does not provide a template but rather a list of types of information to be covered. The Issuer intends the Payment Date Report to include information of the types so listed.
The transaction described herein will have to comply with the reporting obligations relating to the Transparency Reports from the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date. Since there remains significant uncertainty as to the form in which Article 7 RTS will be adopted, it is not clear as to what will be required for compliance. Clarification is being sought by industry participants on these matters.
Reporting Entity

The originator, sponsor and SSPE must designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the disclosure requirements (the "reporting entity") although all three entities remain liable for the satisfaction of the disclosure requirements. The Issuer shall, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, agree to act as the reporting entity for the transaction described herein.
Subject to any confidentiality obligations under law, regulation or contract binding upon it, the Portfolio Manager (subject to the Standard of Care under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) shall undertake to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer all reports, data and other information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements. Whether the Issuer will possess or have available to it, or be entitled to receive from the Portfolio Manager as set out in this paragraph, all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the EU Disclosure Requirements is unclear. The Issuer and the Portfolio Manager shall propose to the Collateral Administrator in writing, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the form, content, timing and manner of publication of any such reports and information for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Portfolio Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the competent authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes. Any failure by the Portfolio Manager, the Originator or the Collateral Administrator to fulfil such obligations may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Collateral Administrator agrees to provide services on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the fulfilment of the EU Disclosure Requirements, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer's obligations as the entity responsible to fulfil reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements. In providing such information and reporting, neither the Collateral Administrator (nor any other person) assumes any responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use and/or onward disclosure of such information and reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the reporting obligations, then investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Notes. The Issuer, the Originator and the Portfolio Manager may be subject to administrative sanctions in the case of negligence or intentional infringement of the EU Disclosure Requirements, including pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or 10% of total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanctions levied on the Issuer or indemnified by the Issuer to any Portfolio Manager Party or the Originator may materially adversely affect the Issuer's ability to perform its oblig- ations under the Notes and may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. The Issuer shall not be entitled to indemnification by the Portfolio Manager in respect of any such sanction unless the relevant circumstances are caused by a Portfolio Manager Breach. Investors should note that Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation refers to a liability standard of "negligence and intentional infringement" whereas the definition of Portfolio Manager Breach refers to a less onerous liability standard of "bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law)…or reckless or intentional disregard". Furthermore, the contractual obligation of the Portfolio Manager in respect of the EU Disclosure Requirements pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement is to (subject to the Standard of Care under the
Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator certain information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer of its obligations as the designated reporting entity for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. There is therefore no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager will supply to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator at all or in timely fashion the information required by the Issuer to satisfy the Issuer's obligations in respect of the EU Disclosure Requirements.
Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Portfolio Manager or the Originator may materially adversely effect the ability of the Portfolio Manager or the Originator (as the case may be) to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. As of the date of this Offering Circular, in respect of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager and the Originator, only the Issuer is established in the European Union and is therefore directly subject to the Securitisation Regulation and the sanctions provisions thereof.
See further 4.28 "Portfolio Manager" and "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement" for certain other information relevant to the indemnification of the Portfolio Manager Parties by the Issuer and the definition of Portfolio Manager Breach. The indemnification of the Originator by the Issuer will be documented in the Retention Undertaking Letter, pursuant to which the Originator, its officers, employees and directors will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer in relation to any liability to which it or they may be or become subject or which may be incurred by it or them in connection with the EU Disclosure Requirements, such loss being payable as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
See further 2.2 "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – EU Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements" for certain other information relevant to investors in respect of the Securitisation Regulation.
2.5 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 ("EMIR") and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to "over-the-counter" ("OTC") derivative contracts according to whether they are "financial counterparties" such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see 2.6 (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are "non-financial counterparties" (or third country entities equivalent to "financial counterparties" or "non-financial counterparties").
Financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) will be subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the "clearing obligation") all "eligible" OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the "reporting obligation") (in which respect the Issuer may appoint one or more reporting delegates), and undertake certain risk- mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the "risk mitigation obligations"). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by financial counterparties must also be marked to market and collateral must be exchanged (the "margin requirement"). To the extent that the Issuer becomes a financial counterparty, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.
Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (such as the posting of collateral) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its "group" (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a "group" (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder's holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds, the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.
Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards.
Clearing obligation

The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under "Category 1") to 21 December 2018 (for non- financial counterparties that are not AIFs grouped under "Category 4").
Margin requirements

On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the "RTS"). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.
The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin. The requirement to post margin has applied since 1 March 2017.
If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer's ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer's ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Portfolio Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See "Hedging Arrangements".
The Conditions allow the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR (including the EMIR Refit Regulation) which may become applicable at a future date.
Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non- financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Currency Hedge Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer's ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer's ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Portfolio Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own
independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
EMIR Refit Regulation

Regulation (EU) 2019/834 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (the "EMIR Refit Regulation") was published in the Official Journal on 28 May 2019 and entered into effect on 17 June 2019. The EMIR Refit Regulation has amended EMIR with respect to the definition of financial counterparties ("FCs"), the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories. The EMIR Refit Regulation has also introduced a new concept of a "small financial counterparty" ("SFC") whereby SFCs shall be exempted from the clearing obligation but are subject to risk mitigation obligations (including collateral exchange). A SFC is a FC whose derivative positions are below the clearing thresholds and therefore will be exempted from the clearing obligation. The EMIR Refit Regulation also includes a material change in the way clearing thresholds are calculated for both FCs and NFCs. Instead of using the 30-day rolling average calculation, the aggregate month-end notional average amount for each of the previous 12 months must be used. In the event that the relevant clearing threshold has been exceeded, the counterparty must begin clearing for: (a) that class of derivatives, if it is an NFC; or (b) all clearing classes of derivatives, if it is an FC. For such purposes, FCs will be required to include all of their OTC derivative contracts or all OTC derivative contracts entered into by other entities within the group, within such calculation.
2.6 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers ("AIFMD") regulates alternative investment fund managers ("AIFMs") and provides in effect that each alternative investment fund ("AIF") within the scope of the AIFMD must have a designated AIFM responsible for ensuring compliance with the AIFMD. Although there is an exemption in the AIFMD for "securitisation special purpose entities" (the "SSPE Exemption"), the European Securities and Markets Authority has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it, so there can be no certainty as to whether the Issuer would benefit from the SSPE Exemption. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank has confirmed that pending such further clarification from the European Securities and Markets Authority, "registered financial vehicle corporations" within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as, or appoint, an AIFM unless the Central Bank issues further guidance advising them to do so.
If the Issuer is an AIF (which at this stage is unclear) then it would be necessary to identify its AIFM, which would be the entity which manages it in general and is therefore most likely to be the Portfolio Manager. In such a scenario, the Portfolio Manager would be subject to the AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated and certain duties and responsibilities would be imposed on the Portfolio Manager in respect of its management of the Portfolio. Such duties and responsibilities, were they to apply to the Portfolio Manager's management of the assets of the Issuer, may result in significant additional costs and expenses incurred by the Portfolio Manager which, in respect of some such fees and expenses, may be reimbursable by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement as an Administrative Expense, which may in turn negatively affect the amounts payable to Noteholders. If the Portfolio Manager was to fail to, or be unable to, be appropriately regulated, the Portfolio Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer's assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impair the ability of the Portfolio Manager to manage the Issuer's assets may adversely affect the Portfolio Manager's ability to carry out the Issuer's investment strategy and achieve its investment objective.
If considered to be an AIF, the Issuer would also be classified as a "financial counterparty" under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques
(including margin posting requirements) with respect to Hedge Transactions entered into after the relevant future effective dates. See also 2.5 "European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)" above.
The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.
2.7 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Portfolio Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Portfolio Manager and its affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new offering circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.
None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
2.8 CFTC Regulations
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act regulators in the United States (including the CFTC) have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by, among others, (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps and (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.
Furthermore, regulations requiring the posting of initial and variation margin on uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in the United States on 1 March 2017 for all
registered swap dealers with respect to variation margin (subject to limited relief) and are being phased in for registered swap dealers between 1 September 2016 and 1 September 2020 with respect to initial margin. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty. While transactions existing prior to the relevant implementation date are not subject to the applicable initial and variation margin requirements, new Hedge Transactions, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty, may be subject to the initial and variation margin requirements, as might existing Hedge Transactions that undergo a material amendment, based on guidance provided and positions taken by United States regulators in other contexts. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post initial or variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.
2.9 Commodity Pool Regulation
The Issuer's ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a "commodity pool" as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended ("CEA") and the Portfolio Manager to be a "commodity pool operator" ("CPO") and/or a "commodity trading advisor" (a "CTA"), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a "commodity pool" to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in "commodity interests" which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a "commodity pool" under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on the Issuer's behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of "swap" as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable legal counsel to the effect that none of the Issuer (or its directors or officers), the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator or any of their respective Affiliates or any other person would be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.
If trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer's activities falling within the definition of a "commodity pool", the Portfolio Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer's assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer's positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer's liquidation value. If the Portfolio Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Portfolio Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Portfolio Manager's ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, if the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a "commodity pool" under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Portfolio Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on the Issuer's behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Portfolio Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Portfolio Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.
Further, if the Portfolio Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Portfolio Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer's CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Portfolio Manager
anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Portfolio Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Portfolio Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the "NFA") pass judgement upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related agreement for the placement or purchase of Notes by any Person.
2.10 Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Volcker Rule") and the corresponding implementing rules prevents "banking entities" (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any "ownership interest" in, or in "sponsoring", a "covered fund," subject to certain exemptions. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain transactions with covered funds.
An "ownership interest" is defined widely and may arise through a holder's exposure to the profits and losses of the "covered fund", as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the "covered fund". A "covered fund" is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the "ICA") but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule's implementing regulations.
It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.9 "Commodity Pool Regulation") could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.
The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders' rights in respect of the removal of the Portfolio Manager and selection of a replacement Portfolio Manager shall only be exercisable upon an Portfolio Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non- Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as "ownership interests" in the Issuer.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a "covered fund", the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of "banking entities" to hold an "ownership interest" in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a "banking entity" as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in "ownership interests" of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by "banking entities" in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes, particularly given the lack of interpretative guidance of the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Trustee, the Originator or any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to the investor's investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
In May 2018, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations not relevant to this transaction. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitizations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule's covered fund provisions. It is unclear at this time what changes ultimately will be made to the
Volcker Rule's implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Portfolio Manager.
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a "covered fund" for their purposes.
In addition, on 30 January 2020, the five regulators responsible for the enforcement of the Volcker Rule published proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule (the "Proposed Volcker Changes") that would, among other things, exclude from the definition of "ownership interest" certain senior loans or senior debt interests issued by covered fund. If adopted, the Proposed Volcker Changes may mean that certain of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes would not be considered an "ownership interest". This would be the case regardless of whether such holders of the senior non-deferrable Classes of Rated Notes are held in the form of PM Voting Notes, PM Non-Voting Notes or PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes. There can be no assurances that the Proposed Volcker Changes will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all.
2.11 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies' risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.
2.12 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform
The London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") has been reformed, with developments including:
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers' Association in February 2014;
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.
In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA's intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.
The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA's intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.
It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.
The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, "EURIBOR"), together with LIBOR, and other so-called "benchmarks" are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.
In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the "Benchmarks Regulation") on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU and the UK.
The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to "administrators" and also, in some respects, to "contributors" and certain "users" of "benchmarks", and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of "benchmarks" provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU and UK. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called "critical benchmark" indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including "proprietary" indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated "critical benchmarks" for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017 respectively.
Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):
(a) an index which is a "benchmark" could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and
(b) the methodology or other terms of the "benchmark" could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.
Investors should be aware that:
(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of "benchmarks" could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a "benchmark" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain "benchmarks", trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain "benchmarks" or lead to the disappearance of certain "benchmarks";
(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:
(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and
(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;
(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fallback mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, if a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented as provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Notes.
Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes.
2.13 Financial Transaction Tax
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft directive (the "Commission's Proposal") for a financial transaction tax ("FTT") to be adopted in certain participating Member States (including Belgium, Germany, Estonia (although Estonia has since stated that it will not participate), Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia). If the Commission's Proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on "financial institutions" (which would include the Issuer) in relation to "financial transactions" (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments).
Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the financial transaction is issued in a participating Member State.
The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Issuer with respect to certain transactions if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Any such tax liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and may result in investors receiving less interest and/or principal than expected. To the extent that such liabilities may arise at a time when winding up proceedings have been commenced in respect of the Issuer, such liabilities may be regarded as an expense of the liquidation and, as such, be payable out of the floating charge assets of the Issuer (and its general estate) in priority to the claims of Noteholders and other secured creditors. It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions
by investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission's Proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.
However, the Commission's Proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. additional Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
2.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures
The Uniting and Strengthening America By Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "USA PATRIOT Act"), signed into law on and effective as of 26 October 2001, requires that financial institutions, a term that includes banks, broker-dealers and investment companies, establish and maintain compliance programs to guard against money laundering activities. The USA PATRIOT Act requires the Treasury to prescribe regulations in connection with anti-money laundering policies of financial institutions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), an agency of the Treasury, has announced that it is likely that such regulations would require pooled investment vehicles such as the Issuer to enact anti-money laundering policies.
Many other jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively with the USA PATRIOT Act, the "AML Requirements"). Any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Trustee or the Agents or any of their respective Affiliates could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. The AML Requirements could require the Issuer to implement additional restrictions on the transfer of the Notes.
The Issuer reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a Noteholder and the source of the payment of subscription monies, or as is necessary to comply with any customer identification programs required by FinCEN and/or the SEC or any other applicable AML Requirements. If there is a delay or failure by the applicant to produce any information required for verification purposes, an application for or transfer of Notes and the subscription monies relating thereto may be refused.
2.15 CRA3
Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies ("CRA3") came into force on 20 June 2013. Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.
2.16 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
At a meeting in Paris on 29 May 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Council at Ministerial Level adopted a declaration on base erosion and profit shifting urging the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs to develop an action plan to address base erosion and profit
shifting in a comprehensive manner. In July 2013, the OECD launched an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS"), identifying fifteen specific actions to achieve this. Subsequently, the OECD published discussion papers and held public consultations in relation to those actions, also publishing interim reports, analyses and sets of recommendations in September 2014 for seven of the actions. On 5 October 2015, the OECD published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan, which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the "Final Report"). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.
The focus of one of the actions from this project (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances.
Whether the Issuer is subject to United Kingdom corporation tax by virtue of the activities of the Portfolio Sub-Manager may depend on whether it can benefit from Articles 5 and 8 of the UK-Ireland double tax treaty. Further, the Issuer may rely on the interest and other articles of treaties entered into by Ireland to be able to receive payments from some Obligors free from withholding taxes that might otherwise apply.
The OECD recommendations on Action 6 are primarily being implemented into double tax treaties through a multilateral convention. The multilateral convention has been signed by over 75 jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom and Ireland). It entered into force on 1 July 2018 for signatories who deposited their ratification, acceptance or approval on or before 22 March 2018. For signatories who deposited or deposit their ratification, acceptance or approval after 22 March 2018, the multilateral convention comes into force at the start of the month which is three entire calendar months after such deposit takes place. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification on 29 June 2018 and therefore the multilateral convention came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification on 29 January 2019 and therefore the multilateral convention came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019. The date from which provisions of the multilateral convention have effect in relation to a treaty depends on several factors including the type of tax which the relevant treaty article relates to.
Upon ratifying the multilateral convention each of the United Kingdom and Ireland deposited a non- provisional list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the multilateral convention, Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions which have ratified the multilateral convention, by the inclusion of a principal purpose test ("PPT").
Once in effect, a PPT could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is currently unclear how a PPT, if adopted, would be applied by the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which payments are made to the Issuer or the United Kingdom in relation to the application of Articles 5 and 8 of the UK-Ireland double tax treaty. It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to their double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefit of these treaties.
In particular, it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to the UK-Ireland double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties as a result of the adoption of the PPT under Action 6) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland's network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business, tax and financial position.
2.17 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2
As part of its anti-tax avoidance package, the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the "Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive"). Member States had until 2019 to
implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.
Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that "exceeding borrowing costs" in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. "Exceeding borrowing costs" is a defined term which relates to the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed "interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets". Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving Member States and third countries (the "Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2"). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires Member States to either deny deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 was required to be implemented in the Member States' national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and was required to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022.
The Irish Finance Act 2019 includes legislation dealing with hybrid mismatches which came into effect on 1 January 2020. The implementation date for the interest limitation provision in Ireland is yet to be announced. Accordingly, the final form and impact of the interest limitation rule in Ireland remains uncertain.
2.18 Taxation Implications of Reinvestment Amounts
A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts). Subordinated Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a Reinvestment Amount. Subordinated Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment to them of making a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts).
2.19 Diverted Profits Tax
The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the "diverted profits tax" which is charged at 25 per cent. of any "taxable diverted profits". The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident company's trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.
Should the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager be assessed to diverted profits tax, it will in certain circumstances be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the Interest
Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that H.M. Revenue & Customs would be entitled to seek to assess the Issuer to any diverted profits tax due directly rather than through the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager as its UK tax representative. Should the Issuer be assessed directly on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay such amounts in accordance with Interest Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments, or (save for following the enforcement of security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the Trust Deed) the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable.
If the United Kingdom imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Collateral Tax Event. If a Collateral Tax Event were to occur the Rated Notes may be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole
- Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) in whole but not in part at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, or the Originator.
2.20 Value Added Tax treatment of the Portfolio Management Fees

The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish domestic law, the Portfolio Management Fees should be exempt from VAT. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a "qualifying company" as defined in section 110 of the TCA.
This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the "VAT Directive"), which provides that Member States shall exempt from VAT the management of "special investment funds" as defined by Member States.
Historically, a similar position has been taken by The Netherlands, however recent developments have changed this and the approach of the Dutch tax authorities currently is that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in The Netherlands. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a "special investment fund". The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities ("UCITS") as defined in EU Directive 2009/65/EC could only qualify as "special investment funds" if they are "subject to specific State supervision" because only "investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors" as UCITS.
Partly in response to the Fiscale Eenheid X case, the European Commission has asked the VAT Committee (an advisory body comprising representatives from tax authorities of all of the Member States and chaired by a representative from the European Commission) to shed light on the types of entities that can also qualify as "special investment funds". A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a "special investment fund" if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.
The views expressed by the VAT Committee are merely advisory and do not necessarily have the agreement of the European Commission. Furthermore, its views are not legally binding and the courts may disagree with them. There is nevertheless a risk that the European Commission will accept the views of the VAT Committee and will conclude that entities such as the Issuer cannot qualify as a "special investment funds" because they are either not subject to the right sort of regulatory supervision in Ireland and/or because they do not target the same circle of investors as UCITS.
Member States have a degree of discretion on how to define "special investment funds", and therefore there are some discrepancies amongst Member States on the meaning of the term. The Fiscale Eenheid X case was about how broad that discretion is. The application of the VAT exemption for "special investment funds" could now be reviewed at a Member State level and/or by the European Commission to ensure that the definitions used are within the ambit of discretion permitted by the VAT Directive.
The Issuer is not aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management paid by entities such as the Issuer. However, it is possible that some Member States (including Ireland) could change their domestic VAT laws, or the European Commission could require them to do so. If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Portfolio Management Fees. The standard VAT rate in Ireland is currently 23 per cent. It is also possible that Ireland could be required to recover the benefit of the VAT exemption obtained before the date on which the law changes from the Issuer together with interest.
The imposition of VAT in Ireland on the Portfolio Management Fees will not constitute a Note Tax Event or a Collateral Tax Event. Accordingly, Noteholders will not become entitled to redeem the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) or Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) as a consequence thereof. Furthermore, it may not be possible to substitute the Issuer with another company that is incorporated in another jurisdiction within the European Economic Area that does not charge VAT on CLO collateral management and administration fees.
2.21 The Common Reporting Standard
The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the "CRS"). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) ("FIs") relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation ("DAC II") implements the CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other Member States on an annual basis.
Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS and the CRS (and DAC II) have been implemented into Irish law.
Over 100 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 49 countries, including Ireland, and all other Member States (known as the "Early Adopter Group" ) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners issued regulations to implement the requirements of the CRS and DAC II into Irish law under which Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) are obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons' tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.
The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer's (or any nominated service provider's) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the
Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance, (iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.
2.22 Regulated Banking Activity
In many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities "in" certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, "Regulated Banking Activities") is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.
Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer's ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.
2.23 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the "BRRD") equips national authorities in Member States (the "Resolution Authorities") with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, "relevant institutions"). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution's failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of "bail-in" powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to "bail-in" the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.
The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance ("Stay Regulations"), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes ("SRRs") vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA") has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA's policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to "stays" under SRRs.
The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the "SRB") and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the "SRM Regulation"). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.
2.24 Centre of Main Interests
The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the "Recast EU Insolvency Regulation"), the Issuer's centre of main interest ("COMI") is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.
As the Issuer's COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute "proof to the contrary" regarding the location of a company's COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that "factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties" would be needed to demonstrate that a company's actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company's COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.
As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer's COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES

3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer
Currently, no market exists for the Notes. The Sole Arranger and Initial Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) may make a market for the Notes but is not under any obligation to do so, and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time without notice. The Notes are illiquid investments. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop, or if a secondary market does
develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or will continue for the life of the Notes. Over the past few years, notes issued in securitisation transactions have experienced historically high volatility and significant fluctuations in market value. Additionally, some potential buyers of such notes now view securitisation products as an inappropriate investment, thereby reducing the number of potential buyers and/or potentially affecting liquidity in the secondary market. Noteholders must therefore be prepared to hold their Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See "Plan of Distribution" and "Transfer Restrictions". Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.
In addition, PM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into PM Voting Notes or PM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for PM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the PM Non-Voting Notes and the PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
3.2 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty or the Trustee.
None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub- Manager, the Originator, the Agents, the Directors, any Hedge Counterparty, the Trustee or any Affiliate thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any Noteholder of ownership of the Notes, and no Noteholder may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each Noteholder will be required to represent (or, in the case of certain non-certificated Notes, deemed to represent) to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger and the Initial Purchaser, among other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is within its powers and authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly authorised by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.
3.3 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility
The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may in some cases require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
3.4 The Notes are Subject to Optional Redemption in Whole or in Part by Class
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:
(a) on any Business Day after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, either (x) at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (y) at the direction in writing of the Originator (subject to the ability of the Subordinated Noteholders to object to such redemption directed by the Originator acting by way of Ordinary Resolution);
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of
(x) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution or (y) the Originator; or
(c) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event and the satisfaction of certain conditions at the direction of (x) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (y) the Originator,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Portfolio Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

In addition, any Reset Amendment (including any amendment to the Transaction Documents that would otherwise have required an Extraordinary Resolution of the relevant Class or Classes of Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution) were it not made at the same time as a Refinancing of all Classes of Rated Notes in whole) may be approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Subordinated Noteholders. See Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution).
As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions and the consent of the Portfolio Manager, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing). It should be noted that a Refinancing or the issuance of additional Notes will result in the application of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. As such, the ability of the Issuer and the Noteholders to issue additional notes or enter into a Refinancing may be impacted. See 2.2 "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - U.S. Risk Retention Rules".
Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes should note that their ability to direct or elect for optional redemption of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part by Class) in certain of the above circumstances is subject to the consent of the Portfolio Manager at the time, which consent may be withheld in the Portfolio Manager's sole discretion.
The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed to the extent the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that such amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).
The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Portfolio Manager.
The Portfolio Manager or the Originator may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
If there is an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes or, in certain circumstances, that losses would not be incurred on the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Portfolio Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing. In addition, a Refinancing may result in a Class of Rated Notes having a shorter maturity date than other Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.7 "Refinancing".
3.5 The Notes are Subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Portfolio Manager
The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion provides written certification to the Trustee (on which the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) that it (A) has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days using commercially reasonable endeavours, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional or Substitute Collateral Obligations or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, has determined, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, that a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.
3.6 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes
Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the holders of the Rated Notes or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests) and Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event).

3.7 Refinancing
Following a Refinancing in part pursuant to the Conditions, a Class of Refinancing Obligation may in certain circumstances have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of the Classes of Notes ranking lower than such Refinancing Obligations in the Priorities of Payment. This could result in the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) being required to sell Collateral Obligations or use Principal Proceeds which could have been used for reinvestment to redeem such maturing Class of Notes. This could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders.
3.8 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Portfolio Manager notifies the Issuer, the Rating Agencies and the Trustee that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.
3.9 The Portfolio Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. See "The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period" below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
3.10 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and/or a Note Event of Default
Additional Issuances

At any time during the Reinvestment Period with respect to the Rated Notes and from time to time with respect to the Subordinated Notes, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Originator, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer's issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) apply such net proceeds as Interest Proceeds pursuant to the Interest Priority of Payments or for other Permitted Uses. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).
Redirection of Funds to Reinvestment

The Portfolio Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds (including by deferring, designating for reinvestment or waiving payment of some or all of its Portfolio Management Fees) to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses.
Portfolio Manager Advances

The Portfolio Manager may make Portfolio Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(m) (Portfolio Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Portfolio Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Each Portfolio Manager Advance shall not be less than €1,000,000 and may accrue interest at a rate of up to EURIBOR (as determined in respect of the Notes from time to time pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest), subject to a minimum of zero) plus 2.00 per cent. per annum.
Reinvestment Amounts

Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts) by contributing assets to the Issuer either directly or indirectly by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will decide in its sole discretion (but subject always to compliance with its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement including the "Standard of Care" as defined therein) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.
Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see 3.19 "Average Life and Prepayment Considerations").
3.11 Additional Issuances of Subordinated Notes not subject to Anti-Dilution Rights
The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including that the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. However, this requirement does not apply to any additional issuance of Subordinated Notes if such issuance is required in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency for any reason. Accordingly, the proportion of Subordinated Notes held by a Subordinated Noteholder may be diluted following an additional issuance of Subordinated Notes. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).

3.12 Limited Recourse Obligations
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Originator, the Trustee, the Corporate Services Provider, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer's Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Originator, the Trustee, the Issuer, the Corporate Services Provider, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Reinvesting Noteholders (if any); (c) thirdly, the Class F Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class E Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class D Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class C Noteholders; (g) seventhly, the Class B Noteholders; and (h) lastly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders, the Trustee or any other Secured Party (or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, examinership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer. These limited recourse provisions shall survive the termination of the Notes.
3.13 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders
Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer's bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation
pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer's assets.
3.14 Subordination of the Notes
Except as described below, the Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes, and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.
The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full, subject to and as more fully described in the Priorities of Payment. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account (or to repay principal on the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence) if the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.
Non-payment of any Interest Amounts due and payable in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or 10 Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of or has actual knowledge of such error or omission). In such circumstances, the Class A Noteholders (or following redemption in full of the Class A Notes, the Class B Noteholders), acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default). However, non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes on any Payment Date will not constitute a Note Event of Default, even if such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class.
If any acceleration of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes occurs the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the
conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of: (i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders and (vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class which is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes, provided that such action is consistent with the applicable law and with all other provisions of the Trust Deed. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).
3.15 Calculation of Rate of Interest
If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any related rate of interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the related rate of interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, none of the Portfolio Manager, any Agent or the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis and shall suffer no liability to any Noteholder for any adverse effects or losses incurred as a result.
Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes (if there is a material disruption to, change in the methodology of calculating of or cessation of EURIBOR, or the Portfolio Manager reasonably expects any of the foregoing will occur) without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented as provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).
3.16 Amount and Timing of Payments
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be a Note Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
As described above, failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, even where such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class, will not be a Note Event of Default. Holders of such Classes of Notes will consequently have no right to accelerate their Notes or to direct that the Trustee take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral to recover the principal amount of their Notes outstanding in such circumstances.
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
3.17 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited
The Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports and, if the Collateral Administrator agrees to provide reporting in this regard, the Investor Reports and the Portfolio Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Portfolio Manager. Noteholders may access these reports by way of a unique password obtained from the Collateral Administrator (or as may otherwise be permitted by the Portfolio Manager). In preparing and furnishing these reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (which will rely conclusively, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Portfolio Manager), and the Issuer will not verify, recompute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.
3.18 Ratings of the Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope
A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency's opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Rated Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Rated Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Rated Notes and the market value of such Rated Notes is likely to be adversely affected.
Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.
The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Rated Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, Noteholders may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer's ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral Obligations (including by restricting the ability of the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer to undertake discretionary sales of Collateral Obligations or reinvest Sale Proceeds and/or Unscheduled
Principal Proceeds in Substitute Collateral Obligations following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, in each case due to the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period following a downgrade or withdrawal of ratings in relation to certain of the Rated Notes). See "The Portfolio" and "Ratings of the Notes".
As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Rating Agencies may refuse to give Rating Agency Confirmations

Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by Noteholders.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in Withdrawal of Ratings if Certain Actions are not Taken by the Issuer

On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the "arranger" (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,
(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the "arranger" is the Issuer.
Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger's certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes ("Unsolicited Ratings") which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and
market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes. The Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee and each of their respective Affiliates are not obliged to take any action following the publication or announcement of any such Unsolicited Ratings.
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.
Actions of any Rating Agency can Adversely Affect the Market Value or Liquidity of the Notes

The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of "due diligence services" for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant's agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager, and portions of this report may constitute "due diligence services" under Rule 17g-10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, other services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute "due diligence services" under Rule 17g-10. Consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.
3.19 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations
The Maturity Date of the Notes is 22 January 2033 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the Obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.
3.20 Projections, Forecasts and Estimates are Forward Looking Statements and are Inherently Uncertain
Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes (including in connection with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules), are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will
vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
3.21 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders' opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority. Furthermore, if a Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any creditors' rights against the Issuer and will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the Trust Deed. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to the holders of subordinated Classes of Notes and in particular, the Subordinated Notes, following any liquidation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds from the Collateral to pay senior Classes of Notes and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the Issuer.
In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes, or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations, instead being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes or paid into the Principal Account for the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations until such tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.6 "Mandatory Redemption of the Notes".
Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.
3.22 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes
It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.
3.23 Withholding Tax on the Notes
So long as the Notes remain listed on the Global Exchange Market or another stock exchange which is a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of Section 64 of the TCA, Irish withholding tax should not be imposed on payments on the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as described under Condition 9 (Taxation), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to a holder if required to do so by law (including FATCA) or by any relevant taxation authority.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax (other than in circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, the imposition of withholding tax in respect of FATCA) or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or the Originator, subject to certain conditions.
3.24 Book-entry Holders are not Considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed and may Delay Receipt of Payments on the Notes
Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.
Noteholders owning a book-entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See "Form of the Notes".
3.25 Security
Clearing Systems

Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer's ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities if the Custodian or its sub-custodian becomes insolvent.
In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect
in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party or any of their respective Affiliates.
Fixed Security

Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
3.26 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution or, in the case of a decision in relation to the removal of the Portfolio Manager, following the occurrence of a Portfolio Manager Event of Default (other than pursuant to paragraph (vii) of the definition thereof), by way of PM Removal Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.
The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.
Any Notes (including Rated Notes and Subordinated Notes) held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person, shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution.
If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes voted in respect of such Resolution and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. The voting threshold at any Noteholders' meeting in respect of an Ordinary Resolution, an Extraordinary Resolution or a PM Removal Resolution is, respectively, more than 50 per cent., at least 66⅔ per cent. or at least 75 per cent. of the votes cast on such Resolution. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution, PM Removal Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of (i) a PM Removal Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount
Outstanding of the relevant Class or Classes of Notes; (ii) an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable), and (iii) an Ordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, if a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.
Notes that are in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any PM Removal Resolution or any PM Replacement Resolution.
Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of PM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such PM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a PM Removal Resolution and a PM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of PM Non- Voting Notes and/or PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the PM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that, as noted above, in order to pass a PM Removal Resolution, a higher voting threshold and a higher quorum requirement applies than in respect of an Extraordinary Resolution. Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of PM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class. Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.
Certain amendments, waivers and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendments, waivers or modifications could be adverse to certain Noteholders. Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that
(i) the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, the Reinvestment Criteria or the Collateral Quality Tests, the Fitch Tests Matrix or the S&P coefficients C0, C1 or C2 in the definition of "S&P CDO BDR" and the related definitions, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained and (to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) the Controlling Class has consented by way of Ordinary Resolution but without the consent of any other Class of Noteholders and (ii) modifications made pursuant to Condition 14(c)(xxviii) (Modification and Waiver) where the replacement reference rate is not an Alternative Base Rate may be effected by way of Ordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders only and, as such, fundamental amendments to the reference rates applicable to the deal may be effected either with no Noteholder approval or with the approval of a simple majority of each of the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders.
Investors should note that for the purposes of determining voting rights attributable to the Notes and the applicable quorum at any meeting of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution), the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall, in each case, together be deemed to constitute a single Class in respect of any voting rights specifically granted to them (including as the Controlling Class). As a consequence, holders of the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes, in each case, shall act not separately, but together as a single Class for voting purposes, including in relation to amendments where the interests of such Noteholders may not be aligned.
Certain entrenched rights relating to the Notes including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution (unless they constitute a Reset Amendment) but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in
respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.
In addition to the Trustee's right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents which, in its opinion, are made to correct a manifest error or which are of a formal, minor or technical nature, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).
Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.
Furthermore, the Portfolio Manager will also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent that any material amendment is to be made to a provision of a Transaction Document. The Portfolio Manager may have reasons to withhold its consent to a material amendment to a provision of a Transaction Document even if such material amendment would be in the best interest of the Issuer or the Noteholders generally.
3.27 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes
If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Portfolio Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Noteholders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).
3.28 Enforcement Rights Following a Note Event of Default
If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, give notice to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following a Note Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) of the definition thereof, such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith), would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; or otherwise (B) (1) in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in Condition 10(a)(i), (ii) or (iv) (Note Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to such Note Event of Default; or (2) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes (acting independently and each by way of Extraordinary Resolution) directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action.
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the
Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.
3.29 Certain ERISA Considerations
Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ("ERISA"), if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code") or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, "Plans") invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated by the Issuer could be considered "prohibited transactions" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See "Certain ERISA Considerations" below.
3.30 Forced Transfer
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines at any time that any (i) holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a "U.S. person" as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a "U.S. Person") and is not both a QIB and a QP (any such person, a "Non-Permitted Noteholder") or (ii) Noteholder has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction (under ERISA or the Code), Benefit Plan Investor, Controlling Person, Other Plan Law or Similar Law representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading, or whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in the Plan Asset Regulation (any such Noteholder a "Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder"), the Issuer shall, or, in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder, may, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non- Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) demanding that such Holder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or to a person that is not a Non- Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) within 30 calendar days (or 10 calendar days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder) of the date of such notice. If such Holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder), (a) the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder; and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.
In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that, if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate tax forms or certifications that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder's ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder's Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
3.31 U.S. Tax Risks
Imposition of Tax on Non-U.S. Noteholders

Distributions on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Noteholder (as defined in "Tax Considerations - U.S. Federal Income Taxation") that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain recognised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Noteholder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the payments or gain are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by
the Non-U.S. Noteholder in the United States or, in the case of gain, the Non-U.S. Noteholder is a non- resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale, and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Noteholders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.
U.S. Trade or Business

Although the Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a "United States real property interest" or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to a Note Event of Default and a Portfolio Manager Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer's ability to make payments on the Notes.
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Additionally under existing U.S. Treasury Regulations, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of U.S. Collateral Obligations was to take effect on 1 January 2019; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, which may be currently relied upon, would eliminate FATCA withholding on such types of payments. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain Noteholders to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on "passthru" payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain "foreign financial institutions" that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder's ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder's Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
The Issuer is expected to be treated as a passive foreign investment company and may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation

The Issuer is expected to be a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which means that a U.S. Noteholder (as defined in "Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation") of Subordinated Notes (and any other Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be subject to adverse tax consequences, unless such U.S. Holder elects to treat the Issuer as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") and to recognise currently its proportionate share of the Issuer's income whether or not distributed to such U.S. Noteholder. In addition, depending on the overall ownership of interests in the Issuer, a U.S. Holder of 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power or 10 per cent. or more of the combined value of the Subordinated Notes (and any other Classes of Notes
treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be treated as a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder (as defined in "Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Income Taxation – U.S. Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes – Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation") in a controlled foreign corporation ("CFC") and required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the "subpart F income" of the Issuer, whether or not distributed to such U.S. Noteholder. A U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election, or that is required to include subpart F income in the event that the Issuer is treated as a CFC, may recognise income in amounts significantly greater than the payments received from the Issuer. Taxable income may exceed cash payments when, for example, the Issuer uses earnings to repay principal on the Notes or accrues income on the Collateral Obligations prior to the receipt of cash or the Issuer discharges its debt at a discount. A U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election or that is required to recognise currently its proportionate share of the subpart F income of the Issuer will be required to include in current income its pro rata share of such earnings, income or amounts whether or not the Issuer actually makes any payments to such U.S. Noteholder. The Issuer will cause its independent accountants to supply U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes, at such U.S. Noteholder's request and at the Issuer's expense, with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Noteholder reasonably requests to satisfy filing requirements with respect to making a QEF election and to satisfy filing requirements under the CFC rules.
Possible treatment of the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes

The Class E Notes and Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note or Class F Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Noteholders (as defined in "Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation") may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective QEF election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes. See "Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation – U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes."
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under "Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation" below.
3.32 Flip Clauses
The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor ("flip clauses"), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor's insolvency breaches the "anti-deprivation" principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor's position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code's safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck
acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision "directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts". While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.
On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty's automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is "flipped" or modified upon, for example, such counterparty's default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code's safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer's ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
3.33 UK Taxation of the Issuer
In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.
As the Issuer is incorporated in Ireland, the Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.
The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer's behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Portfolio Manager and the Portfolio Sub-Manager will, however, have and are expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Portfolio Manager and Portfolio Sub-Manager carry out on its behalf provided that the Issuer's activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.
Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Portfolio Sub- Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK taxation if the specific domestic UK tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non- resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the "Investment Manager Exemption") is available in the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available if the Portfolio Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK taxation if the exemption in Article 8(1) of the UK-Ireland tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub- Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK-Ireland tax treaty.
Should the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Portfolio Sub-Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
If the United Kingdom imposed corporation tax on the net income or profits of the Issuer this may, in certain circumstances, constitute a Collateral Tax Event. If a Collateral Tax Event were to occur the Rated Notes may be redeemed in accordance with 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) in whole but not in part at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, or at the written direction of the Originator. The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a "trade of dealing in or developing UK land", (b) it disposes of "interests in UK land" or certain assets other than "interests in UK land" which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a "substantial indirect interest" in that land, or (c) it carries on a "UK property business " or has other "UK property income". However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.
3.34 Notes held by the Portfolio Manager and Portfolio Manager Related Persons
The Originator will purchase the Retention Notes on the Issue Date and the Portfolio Manager and other Portfolio Manager Related Persons may purchase other Notes on or after the Issue Date. Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person shall be disenfranchised in respect of any PM Removal Resolution and any PM Replacement Resolution. There will be no restriction on the ability of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person to purchase the Notes (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) and to exercise any other voting rights to which such Notes are entitled. In addition, there will be no restriction on the ability of the Originator to divest of Notes, other than the Retention Notes.
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL

4.1 The Portfolio

The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Portfolio Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as
disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgement and ability of the Portfolio Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.
Neither the Issuer, the Sole Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, or any of their respective Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.
Furthermore, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, (other than in the case of Participations) become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Portfolio Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults
The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Unsecured Senior Loans and/or Unsecured Senior Bonds), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds as well as certain other investments lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non- Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See "The Portfolio".
An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be
adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.
To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.
The composition of the collateral pool may be influenced by discussions that the Portfolio Manager and/or, prior to the Issue Date, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser may have with investors, and there is no assurance that (i) any investor would have agreed with any views regarding the initial proposed portfolio that are expressed by another investor in such discussions, (ii) the collateral pool was not, and will not be, influenced more heavily by the views of certain investors, particularly if that investor's participation in the transaction is necessary for the transaction to occur, in which case the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger, or the Initial Purchaser would not receive the benefits of its role in the transaction, and in order to preserve the possibility of future business opportunities between the Portfolio Manager, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser and such investors, (iii) those views, and any modifications made to the portfolio as a result of those discussions, will not adversely affect the performance of a holder's Notes, or (iv) the views of any particular investors that are expressed in such discussions will influence the composition of the collateral pool. The Portfolio Manager will have sole authority to select, and sole responsibility for selecting, the Collateral Obligations. Except for a right to approve purchases under the Warehouse Arrangements as described below, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have not and will not determine the composition of the collateral pool.
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date

On behalf of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations (each, a "Warehoused Asset", and collectively, "Warehoused Assets") during the period prior to the Issue Date (such period, the "Warehouse Period") pursuant to a financing arrangement (the "Warehouse Arrangements") between, amongst others, the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (as "Senior Lender") and certain third party investors (such third party investors, the "Warehouse Investors") with respect to such purchases. The Warehouse Arrangements will be terminated on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Senior Lender and the Warehouse Investors in connection with such arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.
Under the Warehouse Arrangements, the Senior Lender and Warehouse Investors provided, and will provide prior to the Issue Date, financing to the Issuer. Such funds were used by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) for the acquisition of the Warehoused Assets (provided that the Senior Lender approves the purchase of any such Warehoused Assets). The approval by the Senior Lender of the purchase of any Warehoused Assets will be in its capacity as financing party and should not be viewed as a determination by the Senior Lender or any Affiliate thereof as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether it will satisfy the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer. If the Senior Lender does not approve the purchase of any Warehoused Assets, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) may be restricted from purchasing
that asset for a certain period, which may result in the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) paying a higher price.
The Warehouse Investors have, during the Warehouse Period, provided the junior funding to the Issuer. Certain of the Warehouse Investors may, but are not required to, purchase Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. If the Issue Date occurs, any unrealised losses or gains resulting from changes in the market value of the Warehoused Assets as compared to the purchase price of the Warehoused Assets, will be for the account of the Issuer. If the Issue Date does not occur, the Warehouse Investors and the Senior Lender will bear the risk of loss in value of the Warehoused Assets. The interests of the Senior Lender and the Warehouse Investors in respect of the Warehoused Assets will not necessarily align with, and may be directly contrary to, those of the investors in the Notes.
The prices paid for such Collateral Obligations will be the prevailing prices at the time of the execution of such trades and in market circumstances applicable at that time, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and on or prior to the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer's control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date.
In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Investors on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during such period, provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Investors and the Senior Lender.
The financing provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements will be repaid on the Issue Date by applying part of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes. Certain costs and expenses related to the Warehouse Arrangements, including the interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the Warehouse Arrangements and payment of certain fees and reimbursement of certain expenses to such lender and any agents appointed in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, will, therefore, be borne by the Issuer as such amounts will be paid by application of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.
4.4 Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period
During the Initial Investment Period, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy, as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests. See "The Portfolio". The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Portfolio Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. See also 2.5 "European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)".
To the extent it is not possible to, or the Portfolio Manager does not, purchase such additional Collateral Obligations or enter into Currency Hedge Transactions, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as
it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to, acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.
Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Portfolio Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.5 The Target Par Amount
As of the Effective Date, the Issuer is required to have acquired, or entered into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, (a) any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and (b) the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its (i) S&P Collateral Value and (ii) Fitch Collateral Value), subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. If the Target Par Amount has not been reached on the Effective Date an Effective Date Rating Event may occur pursuant to the Conditions which may in certain circumstances lead to an early redemption of the Notes.
4.6 Prepayment Risk
Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made. The rate of prepayments, amortisation and defaults may be influenced by various factors including:
 changes in Obligor performance and requirements for capital;
 the level of interest rates;
 lack of credit being extended and/or the tightening of credit underwriting standards in the commercial lending industry; and
 the overall economic environment, including any fluctuations in the recovery from the current economic conditions.
The Issuer cannot predict the actual rate of prepayments, accelerated amortisation or defaults which will be experienced with respect to the Collateral Obligations. As a result, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for any investor that requires a regular or predictable schedule of principal payments.
Bonds frequently have call or redemption features (with or without a premium or make whole) that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date.
Repayments on bonds may be caused by a variety of factors which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such repayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a repayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and may be acquired in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by holders of the Notes and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.
4.7 Defaults and Recoveries
The Collateral Obligations will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in non-investment grade loans and bonds, which are subject to liquidity, market value, credit, interest rate, reinvestment and certain other risks. It is anticipated that the Collateral Obligations generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade corporate obligations. These risks could be exacerbated to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in one or more particular types of Collateral Obligations.
Prices of the Collateral Obligations may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, prevailing credit spreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The current uncertainty affecting the European economy and the economies of countries in which issuers of the Collateral Obligations are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the value and performance of the Collateral Obligations. Additionally, loans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organised exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customised, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the debt securities market.
There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans
and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.
A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors (including any such analysis prepared by the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser for or at the direction of investors) in determining whether to purchase the Notes.
In some European jurisdictions (including the UK), obligors or lenders may seek a "scheme of arrangement". In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms.
Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See 4.24 "Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations".
It is a requirement of the rating of the Rated Notes that Collateral Obligations that are to constitute Restructured Obligations following a restructuring satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria on the applicable Restructuring Date. Such requirement may result in Collateral Obligations ceasing to be Collateral Obligations following a restructuring of the terms thereof.
4.8 Underlying Portfolio
Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations

The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations in aggregate (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor's creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations and Second Lien Loans are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior
Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.
Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical senior loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.
Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor's shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.
Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at 4.18 "Interest Rate Risk".
The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan.
However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.
Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations

In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation, Second Lien Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading
volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to their debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations

The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks

The Issuer or the Portfolio Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds

High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for High Yield Bonds.
High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such
studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.
The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers' ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.
European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.
In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by Obligors with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.24 "Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations". It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
The Portfolio Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Transaction Documents, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks

The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or
priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the Obligor. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) "debtor-in-possession" financings.
Liens arising by operation of law

Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer's liens on an Obligor's underlying collateral and impair the Issuer's recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer's interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer's lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer's lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer's interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Loans

The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Loans. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loans occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.
4.9 Corporate Rescue Loans
Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involve additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer's original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.
Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer's more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer's ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan may be unsecured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it may have a lien or the priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.
4.10 Bridge Loans
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 3.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to
refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.
4.11 Collateral Enhancement Obligations
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or out of a Portfolio Manager Advance. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time (on any particular Payment Date up to a maximum of three Payment Dates) which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment may not on a cumulative basis exceed €9,000,000 in respect of all Payment Dates.
The Portfolio Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account may also or alternatively be used to fund the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations. There can therefore be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.
To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Portfolio Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Portfolio Manager may, at its discretion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (each such amount, a "Portfolio Manager Advance") to such account pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. All such Portfolio Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
4.12 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations

As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer's rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Portfolio Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected
maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
4.13 Participations, Novations and Assignments
The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a "Selling Institution". Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as "Assignments". Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as "Participations".
The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the Obligor all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the Obligor. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the Obligor and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the Obligor once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the Obligor. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.
Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution's portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the Obligor under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the Obligor. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the Obligor and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. If the Selling Institution selling a Participation becomes insolvent or similar, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the Obligor and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the Obligor sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the Obligor. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by an Obligor. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institution may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.
In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the "bail-in" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See
2.23 "EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive".
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount
of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.
4.14 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders
The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.
4.15 Counterparty Risk
Assignments, Participations, and Hedge Transactions, involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.
If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will generally be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction.
Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the "bail-in" powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See 2.23 "EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive".
4.16 Concentration Risk
Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would
subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See "The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests". Although the resulting diversification of Collateral may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.
4.17 Credit Risk
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.
4.18 Interest Rate Risk
The Class A Notes, Class B-1 Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. The Class B-2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.
In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain.
As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, floating rate basis mismatch, maturity date mismatch and/or mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR or LIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (unless such interest rate hedge is a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in paragraph 2.9 "Commodity Pool Regulation". However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer's exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See "Hedging Arrangements".
If a significant number of Collateral Obligations pay interest on a semi-annual basis there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes ("Interest Smoothing"). In
addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of "Frequency Switch Event". There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and reset risks, respectively. Furthermore, the Portfolio Profile Tests permit up to 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount to comprise Annual Obligations (being Collateral Obligations which, in accordance with their terms, pay interest less frequently than semi-annually).
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank's or other central bank's deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer's behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable, in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.
To the extent that the European Central Bank's or other central bank's deposit rate from time to time results in obligors in respect of financial instruments held by the Issuer as Eligible Investments incurring negative deposit rates as a result of having issued such instruments and whilst such instruments remain outstanding, the Issuer (as holder of such instruments) may also be required to compensate the relevant obligors for such chargeable interest incurred in the form of a mandatory reduction in the principal amount outstanding of such instruments in accordance with their terms.
4.19 Non-Euro Obligations and Asset Swap Transactions – Currency Risk
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 20.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations.
Subject to satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Manager may, on behalf of the Issuer, acquire Non-Euro Obligations provided that a Currency Hedge Transaction is entered into in respect of each such Non-Euro Obligation with one or more Currency Hedge Counterparties satisfying the applicable Rating Requirement under which the currency risk is reduced or eliminated, no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non-Euro Obligation. Under each Currency Hedge Transaction, the currency risk arising from the receipt of certain cash flows from the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, including interest and principal payments thereon, are hedged. The Currency Hedge Transaction shall terminate on the maturity date of the Non-Euro Obligation and in the other circumstances specified therein.
Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations may be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). The Portfolio Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Portfolio Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. Furthermore, the terms of a relevant Hedge Agreement may provide for the ability of a Currency Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer
has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. See 2.5 "European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)", 2.8 "CFTC Regulations" and 2.9 "Commodity Pool Regulation".
The Issuer's ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes. In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial up-front payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.
The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.
The principal amount and coupon of any Non-Euro Obligation may, to the extent the related Currency Hedge Transaction terminates, subject to varying levels of haircuts in accordance with the Transaction Documents.
4.20 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances
To the extent the Issuer maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.
During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Portfolio Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Portfolio Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds see 3.9 "The Portfolio Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period". The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Portfolio Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Portfolio. Any decrease in the yield of the Portfolio will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that if the Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale
Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.
4.21 Rising Interest Rates may Render some Obligors Unable to pay Interest on their Collateral Obligations
Most of the Collateral Obligations will bear interest at floating interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by the related Obligors will also increase. As prevailing interest rates increase, some Obligors may not be able to make the increased interest payments on Collateral Obligations or refinance their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligations, resulting in payment defaults, Defaulted Obligations and an inability of the Issuer to make payment on some or all Classes of Notes. Conversely if interest rates decline, Obligors may refinance their Collateral Obligations at lower interest rates which could affect the average life of the Notes.
4.22 Balloon Obligations and Bullet Obligations Present Refinancing Risk
The Collateral may consist of Collateral Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Obligation on a timely basis or at all.
4.23 Ratings on Collateral Obligations
Credit ratings of Collateral Obligations represent the rating agencies' opinions regarding their credit quality but are not a guarantee of such quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Obligations and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a credit rating assigned to any Collateral Obligation is lowered
for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor's current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Obligations that the Issuer holds from time will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward.
The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a Fitch CCC Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating. In some instances, the Fitch Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Fitch or S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Portfolio Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Portfolio Manager. Such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. Please see "Ratings of the Notes" and "The Portfolio".

There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised as at the date of this Offering Circular despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Fitch CCC Obligations and S&P CCC Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests))) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.24 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations
Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors' abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate "debtor friendly" insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes if the relevant Obligor becomes insolvent.
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.
4.25 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination
In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed "lender liability"). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Portfolio Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.
In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called "equitable subordination". Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Portfolio Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.
Because Affiliates of, or Persons related to, the Portfolio Manager may hold equity or other interests in Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the Issuer could be exposed to claims for equitable subordination or lender liability or both based on such equity or other holdings.
The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.
4.26 Loan Repricing
Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.
4.27 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General
At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction
(other than U.S. withholding tax on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can, upon the completion of the relevant procedural formalities be sheltered by application being made under a double tax treaty or otherwise, (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make "gross up" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax or (iii) such withholding tax is imposed under FATCA as a result of the Issuer being unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA due to (X) a holder or beneficial owner of a Note failing to provide the required information to comply with FATCA or otherwise causing the Issuer to be unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA or (Y) a change in law. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the Obligor or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator).
4.28 Portfolio Manager
The Portfolio Manager is given authority in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement to act as Portfolio Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. See "The Portfolio" and "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement". The powers and duties of the Portfolio Manager in relation to the Portfolio include effecting, on behalf of the Issuer, in accordance with the provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Risk Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work- outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See "The Portfolio". Any analysis by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time (i) in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, may be limited to a review of readily available public information (ii) and in respect of Collateral Obligations which are loans or bonds which are not publicly listed, will be in accordance with practices deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer). Any analysis by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in respect of Collateral Enhancement Obligations will also be in accordance with practices deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer).
In addition, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Portfolio Manager's ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager will not be liable for any losses, costs, liabilities or claims incurred as a result of the acts or omissions by the Portfolio Manager Parties under or in connection with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement except by reason of (i) acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of, or reckless or intentional disregard with respect to, the duties of the Portfolio Manager thereunder (provided that a decline in the market value of any Collateral Obligation will not, by itself, constitute wilful misconduct
or gross negligence by the Portfolio Manager) or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Portfolio Manager Information (including any amendment or supplement thereto contained in any amendment or supplement to this Offering Circular approved in writing by the Portfolio Manager) or any omission to state in the sections of this Offering Circular titled "Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)", "Description of the Portfolio Manager", "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – The Originator", "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations", "U.S. Credit Risk Retention", "Description of the Portfolio Sub-Manager", "Description of the Portfolio Sub-Management Agreement" and the fifth paragraph of "Risk Factors – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules" (together, the "Portfolio Manager Information"), a material fact, in each case necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The matters described in (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred to as "Portfolio Manager Breaches" and each individually is a "Portfolio Manager Breach". Investors should note that the concept of "gross negligence" (with such term given its meaning under New York law) may be interpreted by an English court as implying a significantly lower required standard of care on the part of the Portfolio Manager than ordinary negligence under English law. As a result, the Portfolio Manager may have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement where it would otherwise have been liable for failing to reach the required standard of care if a mere ordinary negligence standard under English law were applied under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or if New York law was not designated as the law pursuant to which the concept of gross negligence for this purpose would be interpreted.
The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Portfolio Manager Parties") will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including any pecuniary sanctions to which the Portfolio Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation not arising as a result of any act or omission that constitutes a Portfolio Manager Breach) which will be payable as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, and the Issuer will be entitled to indemnification by the Portfolio Manager as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, no Portfolio Manager Party shall be indemnified as a result of any acts or omissions by any Portfolio Manager Party constituting Portfolio Manager Breaches.
The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than in respect of (i) the Warehouse Arrangements and (ii) the entry into binding commitments to purchase certain Collateral Obligations from the Originator and certain dealers. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Portfolio Manager. The nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer's future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Portfolio Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer's investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.
The performance of other collateralised loan obligation vehicles ("CLO Vehicles") or other similar investment funds ("Other Funds") managed or advised by the Portfolio Manager or Affiliates of the Portfolio Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.
The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Portfolio Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager or any of their respective Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.
In addition, the Portfolio Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described herein under "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement". There can be no assurance that any successor portfolio manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Portfolio Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.
The Portfolio Manager and Portfolio Sub-Manager are not required to devote all of their time to the performance of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds and portfolios.
The information and technology systems of the Portfolio Manager and the Portfolio Sub-Manager may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Portfolio Manager and the Portfolio Sub-Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the operations of the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Portfolio Manager or the Portfolio Sub-Manager to perform their duties under the Transaction Documents.
4.29 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing
The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer and has no authority to advise the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates acts as Hedge Counterparty or owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity. While the Initial Purchaser may own a portion of certain Classes of Rated Notes on the Issue Date and may own Notes at any time, it has no obligation to make any investment in any Notes and may sell at any time any Notes it does purchase. See also 5 "Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates".
4.30 Recharacterisation of Trading Gains
The Portfolio Manager may direct that all or part of any Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments are instead deposited into the Interest Account if (a) such amounts would, in its sole discretion, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency or (b) the conditions in Condition 3(l)(ii)(P) (Interest Account) are satisfied, in the discretion of the Portfolio Manager.
Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. As a result, such Trading Gains would not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations. See Conditions 3(l)(ii)(O) (Interest Account) and 3(l)(ii)(P) (Interest Account).
4.31 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations
The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals at least €225,000,000 (representing 90 per cent. of the Target Par Amount). The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer under the Warehouse Arrangements (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account. The remaining proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account and used to purchase (or enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations during the Initial Investment Period. The Portfolio Manager's decisions
concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Portfolio Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes. There is no assurance that the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria, as applicable.
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Portfolio Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 24 December 2020, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
Under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Portfolio Manager (or the Portfolio Sub-Manager on its behalf) may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Equity Security, an Exchanged Equity Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Portfolio Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Portfolio Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Issuer may not acquire (whether during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period or thereafter) or dispose of any Collateral Obligation (during the Reinvestment Period) unless either (i) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such acquisition or disposal, or (ii) in connection with an acquisition following which the Originator Requirement would not be met, such Collateral Obligation is acquired from the Originator pursuant to the Collateral Acquisition Agreements, in each case unless and to the extent that the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply.
See 4.3 "Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date" above in respect of the price to be paid by the Issuer for such Collateral Obligations and 5 "Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)" in respect of certain potential conflicts of interest related to the Portfolio Manager's relationship with the Originator.
Furthermore, the requirement to satisfy the Originator Requirement (unless and to the extent that the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply) may have an effect on the ability of the Issuer (and the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) to identify and acquire appropriate Collateral Obligations either during the Initial Investment Period (see further 4.4 "Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period") or for reinvestment (see further 4.20 "Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances").
4.32 Valuation Information; Limited Information
None of the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator or any other transaction party or any of their respective Affiliates will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager and the Originator) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. The Portfolio Manager may be in possession of
material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders. In particular, the Portfolio Manager will not have any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Collateral Obligations, except as may be required in connection with the regular reports prepared by the Issuer (or the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trust Deed.
The Noteholders and the Trustee will not have any right to inspect any records relating to the Collateral Obligations, and the Portfolio Manager will not be obligated to disclose any further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Obligations, unless specifically required by (and subject to the restrictions on further disclosure in) the Transaction Documents. Furthermore, the Portfolio Manager may, with respect to any such information disclosed, demand that persons receiving such information execute confidentiality agreements before being provided with the information.
5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Sub-Manager, the Originator, the Initial Purchaser and their respective affiliates are acting in a number of capacities, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The activities of the Rating Agencies in connection with the transaction described herein may also give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)

The following briefly summarises certain potential and actual conflicts of interest which may arise from the overall investment activity of the Portfolio Manager, its clients and its Affiliates, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts. The scope of the activities of the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates and the funds and other clients they advise may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time.
The Portfolio Manager and its clients and Affiliates may buy Notes, from which the Portfolio Manager or such clients or Affiliates may derive revenues and profits in addition to the fees disclosed herein.
The Portfolio Manager is entitled to the Senior Management Fee, the Subordinated Management Fee and in certain circumstances, the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee, subject to the Priorities of Payment as described herein and the availability of funds therefor. By reason of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee, the Portfolio Manager may have a conflict between its obligation to manage the Issuer's portfolio prudently and the financial incentive created by such fees for the Portfolio Manager to make investments that are riskier or more aggressive than would be the case in the absence of such fees. See "The Incentive Portfolio Management Fee may create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations" below.
The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates, any of their respective clients, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors or employees, or funds or other investment accounts managed by the Portfolio Manager or any of its Affiliates ("Related Entities") may engage in transactions with, provide services to, invest in, advise, sponsor and/or act as investment manager to investment vehicles and other persons or entities that may have similar structures and investment objectives and policies to those of the Issuer and that may compete with the Issuer for investment opportunities. The Portfolio Manager acts as an investment manager to the Originator and @Onex. The Portfolio Manager and such Related Entities may receive fees or other benefits for these services or investments even though the Portfolio Manager is not receiving any fee or is receiving lower fees or benefits for its services to the Issuer. This disparity in fee income may create potential conflicts of interest between the Portfolio Manager's obligations to the Issuer and such Related Entities' obligations to other persons for such services. A majority of the Collateral Obligations identified by the Portfolio Manager for purchase by the Issuer has been or will be purchased from the Originator, which is an Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager (see "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements"). In addition, the Portfolio Manager will delegate to the Portfolio Sub-Manager certain duties of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Such delegation shall be made pursuant to the Portfolio Sub-Management
Agreement as described in "Description of the Portfolio Sub-Management Agreement". The Portfolio Sub-Manager will receive a portfolio sub-manager services fee from the Portfolio Manager for so acting.
The Portfolio Manager is an investment adviser registered pursuant to the U.S. Investment Advisers Act and, as such, is subject to the provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act. In addition, the Portfolio Manager is registered in the Canadian province of Ontario as a Portfolio Manager, in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador as an Investment Fund Manager and in all the provinces and territories of Canada as an Exempt Market Dealer. Failure to comply with the requirements imposed on the Portfolio Manager as a consequence of its current registrations or requirements that may be imposed as a result of future registrations may have a significant adverse effect on the Portfolio Manager's ability to perform its duties to the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager's ability to source and execute transactions for the Issuer may also be adversely affected by negative publicity arising from any regulatory compliance failures or other inappropriate behaviour attributed to or any other publicity related to the Portfolio Manager, any Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager or any of their respective investment professionals.
As part of their regular business, the Related Entities hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions both for their respective accounts and for the accounts of their respective clients, on a principal or agency basis, with respect to loans, securities and other investments and financial instruments of all types. The Related Entities also provide investment advisory services, among other services, and engage in private equity, real estate and capital market-oriented investment activities. The Related Entities will not be restricted in their performance of any such services or in the types of debt or equity investments which they may make. The Related Entities may have economic interests in or other relationships with issuers in whose obligations or securities or credit exposures the Issuer may invest. In particular, such persons may make and/or hold an investment in an issuer's securities that may be pari passu, senior or junior in ranking to an investment in such issuer's securities made and/or held by the Issuer or in which partners, security holders, members, officers, directors, agents or employees of such persons serve on boards of directors or otherwise have ongoing relationships. Each of such ownership and other relationships may result in securities laws restrictions on transactions in such securities by the Issuer and otherwise create conflicts of interest for the Issuer. In such instances, the Related Entities may in their discretion make investment recommendations and decisions that may be the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer's investments. In connection with any such activities described above, the Related Entities may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions in securities or investments of a type that may be suitable to be included as Collateral Obligations. The Related Entities will not be required to offer such securities or investments to the Issuer or provide notice of such activities to the Issuer.
Certain Related Entities have invested and may continue to invest in debt obligations that would also be appropriate as Collateral Obligations. No Related Entity has any duty, in making or maintaining such investments, to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any such opportunity to the Issuer. The investment policies, fee arrangements and other circumstances applicable to such other parties may vary from those applicable to the Issuer. The Related Entities may also have or establish relationships with companies whose debt obligations are Collateral Obligations and may now or in the future own or seek to acquire equity securities or debt obligations issued by issuers of Collateral Obligations, and such equity securities or debt obligations may have interests different from or adverse to the debt obligations that are Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Related Entities may serve as a general partner and/or manager of limited partnerships or other entities organised to issue notes or certificates, similar to the Notes, which are secured by high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments, or may manage third party accounts which invest in high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments. The Related Entities may also provide other advisory services for a customary fee to issuers whose debt obligations or other securities are Collateral Obligations, and neither the holders of the Notes nor the Issuer shall have any right to such fees. Certain of the Related Entities may be companies that are controlled by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation, or their respective Affiliates, or an account, fund, client or portfolio established and controlled by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation or their respective Affiliates ("Portfolio Companies") that are issuers of debt obligations or other securities that satisfy the standards for Collateral Obligations, but such debt obligations or other securities will not be purchased by the Issuer. In connection with the foregoing activities, the Portfolio Manager and/or other Related Entities may from time to time come into possession of material nonpublic information that limits the ability of the Portfolio Manager to effect a transaction for the Issuer, and the Issuer's investments may be constrained as a consequence of the Portfolio Manager's inability to use such information for advisory
purposes or otherwise to effect transactions that otherwise may have been initiated on behalf of its clients, including the Issuer.
Furthermore, the Portfolio Manager's ability to advise the Issuer to buy debt obligations for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell debt obligations which are part of the Portfolio may be restricted by limitations contained in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Issuer may be unable to buy or sell debt obligations or to take other actions that the Portfolio Manager might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the holders of the Notes. The Portfolio Manager and any of its Affiliates may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others (including the Originator), which may include, without limitation, serving as portfolio manager or investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by debt obligations such as the Notes and other trusts and pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with debt obligations issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Portfolio Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer, and the Portfolio Manager may furnish investment management and advisory services to others who may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Portfolio Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own debt obligations which are the same type as the Collateral Obligations.
The Portfolio Manager may make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of the Related Entities which differ from those effected with respect to the Portfolio. The Portfolio Manager may often be seeking simultaneously to purchase investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as portfolio manager or for other Related Entities, and the Portfolio Manager will have the discretion to apportion such investments among such entities and accounts. The Portfolio Manager cannot assure equal treatment across its investment clients. If the Portfolio Manager is presented with investment opportunities that fall within the investment objectives of the Issuer and other investment funds and accounts managed by the Portfolio Manager, the Portfolio Manager expects to allocate such opportunities among the Issuer and such other funds and accounts on a basis that the Portfolio Manager determines in good faith is appropriate taking into consideration such factors as the fiduciary duties owed to the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, the primary mandates of the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, the capital available to the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, any restrictions on investment, the sourcing of the transaction, the size of the transaction, the amount of potential follow-on investing that may be required for such investment and the other Collateral Obligations of the Issuer and investments by such other funds and accounts, the relation of such opportunity to the investment strategy of the Issuer and such other funds and accounts, reasons of portfolio balance, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals for the Issuer and each such other fund and any other consideration deemed relevant by the Portfolio Manager in good faith.
There are generally no ethical screens or information barriers among the Portfolio Manager and certain of its Affiliates of the type that many firms implement to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material, non-public information that could influence such decisions. If the Portfolio Manager or any of its personnel were to receive material non-public information about a particular obligor or asset, or have an interest in causing the Issuer to transact a particular asset, the Portfolio Manager may be prevented from causing the Issuer to transact such asset due to internal restrictions imposed on the Portfolio Manager. Notwithstanding the maintenance of certain internal controls relating to the management of material non-public information, it is possible that such controls could fail and result in the Portfolio Manager, or one of its investment professionals, buying or selling an asset while, at least constructively, in possession of material non-public information. Inadvertent trading on material non-public information could have adverse effects on the Portfolio Manager's reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions, and as a consequence, negatively impact the Portfolio Manager's ability to perform its investment management services to the Issuer. In addition, while the Portfolio Manager and certain of its Affiliates currently operate without information barriers on an integrated basis, such entities could be required by certain regulations, or decide that it is advisable, to establish information barriers. In such event, the Portfolio Manager's ability to operate as an integrated platform could also be impaired.
Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and consistent with and subject to applicable law (including applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act), the Portfolio Manager has
directed the Issuer to purchase, and intends to continue to direct the Issuer to purchase, certain Collateral Obligations from the Originator. The Issuer may also enter into agreements to purchase certain Collateral Obligations from other Affiliates, including @Onex, and in each case consistent with and subject to applicable law (including applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act). It is expected that transactions between the Issuer, on the one hand, and the Originator or @Onex, on the other, will be as described under "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements". In addition, the Portfolio Manager may direct the Issuer to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations in cross trades between the Issuer and other clients of the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In such case, the Portfolio Manager and such Affiliates may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding the Issuer and the other parties to such trade. Under certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates may determine that it is appropriate to avoid such conflicts by selling a Collateral Obligation at a fair value that has been calculated pursuant to the Portfolio Manager's valuation procedures to another fund managed or advised by the Portfolio Manager or such Affiliates. In addition, in the future and with the prior blanket authorisation of the Issuer, which can be revoked at any time thereafter, the Portfolio Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law. To the extent that any such transactions may be viewed as a principal transaction due to the ownership interest in the other client by the Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates or any of their personnel, the Portfolio Manager will comply with the requirements of Section 206(3) of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act. However, the Issuer will be barred from acquiring debt assets issued by Portfolio Companies.
The Portfolio Manager and/or its Related Entities may, on behalf of either the Issuer or other of their clients, participate in creditors' committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or workout of issuers of Collateral Obligations. In such circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Obligations and in some circumstances may not be permitted to participate in such committees on behalf of the Issuer.
The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Portfolio Manager's ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations, and the Portfolio Manager is required to comply with these restrictions contained in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interests of the Issuer and the holders of the Notes, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Originator, an Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager, will, in its capacity as originator for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements, acquire at least a majority and up to 100 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date. All or a portion of such Notes to be acquired by the Originator (as a "majority owned affiliate" of the "sponsor") on the Issue Date, will also constitute the U.S. Retention Interest. Subject to the requirements of the Retention Undertaking Letter and of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such Subordinated Notes may be sold by the initial holder of such Subordinated Notes to related and/or unrelated parties at any time after the Issue Date.
So long as such Subordinated Notes are held by the Originator, the Portfolio Manager or any other Portfolio Manager Related Person, such Subordinated Notes (along with any other Notes held by the Originator, the Portfolio Manager or another Portfolio Manager Related Person) shall not have any voting rights in respect of, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on any PM Removal Resolutions or any PM Replacement Resolutions (but shall carry a right to vote and be so counted on all other matters in respect of which the PM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted). See "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement–No Voting Rights".
The Originator owns 24 per cent. of the Issuer's outstanding ordinary shares. The investment in the Subordinated Notes and the holding of the Issuer's ordinary shares by the Originator may give the Portfolio Manager an incentive to take actions which may not be in the best interests of the other Noteholders.
The Portfolio Manager may discuss the composition of the Collateral Obligations and other matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby with any partner or employee of the Portfolio Manager,
its Affiliates or any Related Entities, and may also have such discussions with certain beneficial owners of the Notes. There can be no assurance that such discussions will not influence the actions or inactions of the Portfolio Manager in its role as portfolio manager for the Issuer, which actions or inactions may have material effects on the performance of the Notes.
No assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules would have any future material adverse effect on the Originator's or the Portfolio Manager's (as applicable) willingness to consent to any additional issuances of Notes, Refinancing, or any future material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Issuer or on the market value or liquidity of the Notes. See 2.2 "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules".
There is no limitation or restriction on the Portfolio Manager or any of its Affiliates with regard to acting as investment manager (or in a similar role) to other parties or persons. This and other future activities of the Portfolio Manager and/or its Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.
In certain circumstances, the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates or both may receive compensation in connection with the investment of assets in certain Eligible Investments from the managers of such Eligible Investments. In addition, the Issuer may from time to time invest in Eligible Investments issued by, arranged by or underwritten by the Portfolio Manager or its Affiliates.
The Incentive Portfolio Management Fee may create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations

On each Payment Date, the Portfolio Manager may be paid the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee to the extent of funds available on such Payment Date as described in "Description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement – Compensation of the Portfolio Manager", if the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed as of such Payment Date. Therefore, payment of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee will be dependent to a large extent on the yield earned on the Collateral Obligations. This fee structure could create an incentive for the Portfolio Manager to manage the Issuer's investments in a manner as to seek to maximise the yield on the Collateral Obligations relative to investments of higher creditworthiness. Managing the portfolio with the objective of increasing yield, even though the Portfolio Manager is constrained by investment restrictions described in "The Portfolio", could result in riskier or more speculative investments for the Issuer than would otherwise be the case and in an increase in defaults or volatility and could contribute to a decline in the aggregate market value of the Collateral Obligations.
Holding of Shares in the Issuer

The Originator holds 24 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the Issuer. The other 76 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the Issuer are held by the Share Trustee on trust for charitable purposes. The fact that the Originator will have a shareholding in the Issuer gives rise to the risk that, if the Originator becomes insolvent while the Notes are outstanding, an insolvency official appointed to the Originator in Ireland could seek the making of certain orders in respect of the Issuer, including the making of a pooling or contribution order on a winding-up or an examinership of the Issuer on the basis that it is a related company of the Originator. The making of any such order in respect of the Issuer could impact the timing or amount of recoveries by Noteholders in respect of the Notes. The Issuer and the Portfolio Manager will take steps in structuring the transactions that are intended to minimise the risk that the separate identity of the Issuer would not be respected. These steps include the creation of the Issuer as a separate, special purpose company intended to be treated as bankruptcy-remote from the Originator, restrictions on the nature of its business and an undertaking by the Issuer to observe material legal formalities. The Issuer has agreed to extensive covenants in the Transaction Documents which restrict its activities and require it to conduct its business as a separate identifiable entity. The Issuer has been advised that, provided that such covenants are adhered to, the risk of an insolvency of the Originator triggering insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would be significantly mitigated. However, there can be no assurance that the commencement of any Irish insolvency proceedings in respect of the Originator would not adversely affect the affairs of the Issuer and, consequently, the Noteholders.
Rating Agencies

Fitch and S&P have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating
Agency for its rating services, as is the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates

Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and its Affiliates (together, the "Credit Suisse Parties") will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction, as a lender under the Warehouse Arrangements, as a seller of Collateral Obligations and in other roles described below.
The criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement including but not limited to the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests and Priorities of Payment may be influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have or have had with one or more investors. There is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that any adjustments or modifications which result from such discussions will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes.
An Affiliate of the Initial Purchaser was also a lender under the Warehouse Arrangements.
The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. The Credit Suisse Parties may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). The Credit Suisse Parties expect to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Credit Suisse Parties may retain a certain portion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market.
In addition, the Credit Suisse Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of such financing. The Credit Suisse Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments (including but not limited to instruments such as the Notes) for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business.
The Credit Suisse Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed, underwritten or syndicated certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Credit Suisse Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Credit Suisse Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors affiliated with the Credit Suisse Parties or in which one or more Credit Suisse Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Credit Suisse Parties' own investments in such Obligors while the value of the Notes may decline.
From time to time the Portfolio Manager (pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Credit Suisse Parties and one or more Credit Suisse Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to
interests in Participations and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The entry into of Participations and/or Hedge Transactions by any Credit Suisse Party is expected to increase the profitability of such Credit Suisse Party and it is not intended that the interests of the Noteholders or any other party will be taken into account by the relevant Credit Suisse Party in the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations under Participations or Hedge Transactions. The Credit Suisse Parties may act as initial purchaser and/or portfolio manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.
The Credit Suisse Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse Parties and employees or customers of the Credit Suisse Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to, or referencing, the Notes, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. On the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties will purchase certain Classes of Notes; however, they may sell those Notes at any time. After the Issue Date, Credit Suisse Parties may purchase Notes from time to time. If a Credit Suisse Party becomes an owner of or obtains exposure to any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Credit Suisse Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Credit Suisse Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.
The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer, and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Collateral or the actions of the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer and will have no authority to advise the Portfolio Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer (respectively). If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates own Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owners of Notes in actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.
By purchasing a Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.
6. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by "qualified purchasers" (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
No opinion or no-action position has been requested of the SEC with respect to the status of the Issuer as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences
include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Noteholder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. See 3.30 "Forced Transfer".
7. RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER UNDER IRISH LAW

7.1 Lack of Operating History
The Issuer is a recently incorporated designated activity company with limited liability under Irish law that has no prior operating history or revenues upon which may be used to evaluate its likely performance and the performance of the Notes other than the Warehouse Arrangements and related arrangements entered into by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date to finance the acquisition of Collateral Obligations.
7.2 Preferred Creditors under Irish Law and Floating Charges
If the Issuer becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the Issuer has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, the Noteholders (and other Secured Parties) may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company, such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security which may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, certain rates and taxes, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company's requirements for the duration of his appointment) which have been approved by the relevant Irish courts. See 7.3 "Examinership".
The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.
Where the holder of the security has given notice to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder's liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners' notice to the holder of fixed security.
The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.
In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company which are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.
The essence of a fixed charge is that the person creating the charge does not have liberty to deal with the assets which are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that
such liberty is given to the Issuer any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.
In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the monies standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.
Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security over the relevant charged assets would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.
Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:
(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;
(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up;
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and
(e) they rank after fixed charges.
7.3 Examinership
Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company, which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be unable to pay its debts an examiner may be appointed on a petition to the relevant Irish court.
The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets, the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed charge out of the proceeds of the sale.
During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement.
In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals included a writing down to the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders.
If an examiner were appointed in respect of the Issuer, the primary risks to the Noteholders are as follows:
(a) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;
(b) the Trustee, acting for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, would not be able to enforce rights against the Issuer during the period of examinership;
(c) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and
(d) if a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner's remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the Secured Parties under the Notes or the Transaction Documents.
7.4 Irish Taxation Position of the Issuer
Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Irish withholding tax if there is a change in Irish tax law or if the various exemption conditions set forth under "Tax Considerations - Irish Taxation - Taxation of Noteholders -Withholding Tax" are not fulfilled. The Issuer is not obligated to gross up or otherwise compensate Noteholders for withholding taxes incurred. This may, therefore, affect the return which Noteholders received on the Notes.
Changes in Irish tax laws may adversely impact the Issuer's business and the value of the Noteholders' investment.
The Issuer is treated as a securitisation vehicle which is taxed pursuant to Section 110 of the TCA. There is no guarantee that the tax treatment of an Irish securitisation company will not change in the future. The tax deductibility of the Issuer's interest costs will depend on the applicability of Section 110 TCA and the current revenue practice in relation to that matter. If these rules change this may have an impact on the return for Noteholders.
The Irish Finance Act 2019 (effective from 1 January 2020) introduces a number of anti-avoidance provisions to Section 110 of the TCA in order to strengthen the existing protections against abuse of the regime and which, in certain circumstances, can deny a deduction for profit participating interest or interest in excess of a reasonable commercial return. These amendments are taken into account in the section entitled "Tax Considerations - Irish Taxation".

"Collateral Obligation" means any debt obligation or debt security purchased (including by way of a Participation) by or on behalf of the Issuer from time to time (or, if the context so requires, to be purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer) and which (save for the purposes of determining the scope of the security granted by the Issuer under the Transaction Documents) satisfies the Eligibility Criteria at the time that any commitment to purchase is entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer (or the Participation Agreement is entered into in respect of a Participation). References to Collateral Obligations shall include Non-Euro Obligations but shall not include Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Eligible Investments, Equity Securities or Exchanged Equity Securities. Obligations which are to constitute Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase but which have not yet settled shall be included as Collateral Obligations in the calculation of the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Each Collateral Obligation in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell, but in respect of which such sale has not yet settled, shall be excluded from being Collateral Obligations solely for the purpose of the calculation of the
Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test at any time as if such sale had been completed. The failure of any obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria, at any time after the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer has entered into a binding agreement to purchase it, shall not cause such obligation to cease to constitute a Collateral Obligation unless it is an Issue Date Collateral Obligation which does not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date.

(b) for the purpose solely of calculating the Portfolio Management Fees, the aggregate amount of all accrued and unpaid interest purchased with Principal Proceeds (other than with respect to Defaulted Obligations);
(c) for the purpose solely of calculating the Portfolio Management Fees, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests, obligations which are to constitute Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase, but which have not yet settled, shall be included as Collateral Obligations as if such purchase had been completed and obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell, but in respect of which such sale has not yet settled, shall be excluded from being Collateral Obligations as if such sale had been completed;
(d) the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (only in respect of such amounts that are not designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account), and including the principal amount of any Eligible Investments purchased with such Balance but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest accrued on Eligible Investments, provided that, for such purpose:
(i) Principal Proceeds to be used to purchase Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligations but such purchase(s) have not yet settled shall be excluded from the Balances in the calculation of the Collateral Principal Amount as if such purchase had been completed; and
(ii) Principal Proceeds to be received from Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell the relevant Collateral Obligations but such sale(s) have not yet settled, shall be included in the Balances in the calculation of the Collateral Principal Amount as if such sale had been completed; and
(e) solely for the purposes of calculating the Collateral Principal Amount for the purposes of determining compliance with the EU Retention Requirements, including whether a Retention Deficiency has occurred, the Principal Balance of any Equity Security or Exchanged Equity Security or any other obligation which does not constitute a Collateral Obligation and which shall be:
(i) in the case of a debt obligation or security, the principal amount outstanding of such obligation;
(ii) in the case of an equity security received upon a "debt for equity swap" in relation to a restructuring, the principal amount outstanding of the debt which was swapped for the equity security; and
(iii) in the case of any other equity security, the nominal value thereof as determined by the Portfolio Manager.
For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of calculating the Collateral Principal Amount for the purposes of determining compliance with the EU Retention Requirements or in determining whether a Retention Deficiency has occurred, the Principal Balance of any Collateral Obligation shall be its Principal Balance (converted into Euro at the relevant Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate or at the Spot Rate, as applicable) in each case without any adjustments for purchase price or the application of haircuts or other adjustments.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions, the regulations may be changed by the Issuer in any manner which is reasonably required by the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee) to reflect changes in legal or regulatory requirements or in any
other manner which, in the opinion of the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee and subject to not less than 60 days' notice of any such change having been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)), is not prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the relevant Class of Notes.

If such holder fails to effect the transfer of its Rule 144A Notes within such period, (a) the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer shall cause such Rule 144A Notes to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such Rule 144A Notes. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Rule 144A Notes and selling such Rule 144A Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the permitted Noteholder to the Non-Permitted Noteholder by its acceptance of an interest in the Rule 144A Notes agrees to co-operate with the Issuer to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to submit a written certification substantiating that it is a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. If such holder fails to submit any such requested written certification on a timely basis, the Issuer has the right to assume that the holder of the Notes from whom such a certification is requested is not a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. Furthermore, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse to honour a transfer of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Note to any Person who is not either a non-U.S. Person or a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP.

If any Noteholder is determined by the Issuer to be a Noteholder who has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction (under ERISA or the Code), Benefit Plan Investor, Controlling Person, Other Plan Law or Similar Law representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading, or whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in the Plan Asset Regulation (any such Noteholder a "Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder"), the Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer to the extent required to effect such transfers. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer. The Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder will receive the balance, if any.
(j) Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA
Each Noteholder (which, for the purposes of this Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) may include a nominee or beneficial owner of a Note) will agree to provide the Issuer and its agents with any correct, complete and accurate tax forms or certifications that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer. In the event the Noteholder fails to provide such forms or certifications, or to the extent that its ownership of the Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any taxes to which the Issuer is subject under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Noteholder's ownership of Notes, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Noteholder's ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges, and any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Noteholder as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate ISIN in the Issuer's sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner's interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.

Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees that it shall be bound by any such action taken by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents and the Clearing Systems.

The Noteholders hereby authorise the Registrar and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder.

(i) at any time during the Reinvestment Period, make a cash contribution to the Issuer (provided that, taking into account the Permitted Use for which such proposed cash contribution would be applied, making such contribution would not cause a Retention Deficiency);
(ii) at any time during the Reinvestment Period, designate as a contribution to the Issuer all or a specified portion of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be distributed on a Payment Date to such holder pursuant to paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments or paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments, provided that the relevant Subordinated Notes are held in the form of Definitive Certificates or the procedures of the clearing systems can facilitate such designation (and provided that, taking into account the Permitted Use for which such proposed Reinvestment Amount would be applied, to do so would not cause a Retention Deficiency); or
(iii) subscribe for additional Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to Condition 17(b) (Additional Issuances), as applicable.
Any such proposed Reinvestment Amount is subject to the conditions that:

If such Reinvestment Amount is accepted by the Portfolio Manager, it will be deposited by the Issuer into the Supplemental Reserve Account and applied to a Permitted Use determined by the Portfolio Manager.

Unless retained as directed by the applicable Reinvesting Noteholder, Reinvestment Amounts will be paid to the applicable Reinvesting Noteholder on the first subsequent Payment Date on which Principal Proceeds are available therefor as provided in paragraph (S) of the Principal Priority of Payments or on which Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds are available therefor as provided in the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable.

Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts on the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payment by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not be a Note Event of Default unless and until such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days (or 10 Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission as described in Condition 10(a)(i) (Non-payment of interest)), save as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon as set forth in Condition 9 (Taxation).
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payment by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not constitute a Note Event of Default, but instead will constitute Deferred Interest pursuant to Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest).
Non-payment of amounts due and payable on the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds will not constitute a Note Event of Default.
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay any principal when the same becomes due and payable on any Rated Note on the Maturity Date or any Redemption Date shall be a Note Event of Default provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least 10 Business Days after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission and provided further that, failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Conditions or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails, will not constitute a Note Event of Default.
Subject always, in the case of Interest Amounts payable in respect of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) and save as otherwise provided in respect of any unpaid Portfolio Management Fees (and VAT payable in respect thereof) or Reinvestment Amounts to Reinvesting Noteholders, in the event of non-payment of any amounts referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments on any Payment Date, such amounts shall remain due and shall be payable on each subsequent Payment Date in the orders of priority provided for in this Condition 3 (Status).

Principal Priority of Payments of this Condition 3 (Status) shall include any amounts thereof not paid when due in accordance with this Condition 3 (Status) on any preceding Payment Date.

4. Security
(a) Security
Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the Subscription Agreement (together with the obligations owed by the Issuer to the other Secured Parties) are secured in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties by:
(i) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer's present and future rights, title and interest (and all entitlements or other benefits relating thereto) in respect of all Collateral Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities, Equity Securities, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Eligible Investments standing to the credit of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s)) and any other investments (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral), in each case held by the Issuer from time to time (where such rights are contractual rights (other than contractual rights the assignment of which would require the consent of a third party or the entry by the Trustee into an intercreditor agreement or deed) and where such contractual rights arise other than under securities), including, without limitation, moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof;
(ii) a first fixed charge and first priority security interest granted over all the Issuer's present and future rights, title and interest (and all entitlements or other benefits relating thereto) in respect of all Collateral Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities, Equity Securities, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Eligible Investments standing to the credit of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s)) and any other investments (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral), in each case held by the Issuer (where such assets are securities or contractual rights not assigned by way of security pursuant to paragraph (i) above and which are capable of being the subject of a first fixed charge and first priority security interest), including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof;
(iii) a first fixed charge over all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s)) and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of such Accounts and the debts represented thereby and including, without limitation, all interest accrued and other moneys received in respect thereof;
(iv) a first fixed charge and first priority security interest (where the applicable assets are securities) over, or an assignment by way of security (where the applicable rights are contractual rights) of, all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof and over the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and the debts represented thereby, subject, in each case, to the rights of any Hedge Counterparty to Counterparty Downgrade Collateral pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and any first priority security interest granted by the Issuer to any Hedge Counterparty;
(v) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer's present and future rights against the Custodian under the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (to the extent each relates to the Custody Account) and a first fixed charge over all of the Issuer's right, title and interest in and to the Custody Account (including each cash account relating to the Custody Account) and any cash held therein and the debts represented thereby;
(vi) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer's present and future rights under each Hedge Agreement and each Hedge Transaction entered into thereunder (including the Issuer's rights under any guarantee or credit support annex entered into pursuant to any Hedge Agreement, provided that such assignment by way of security is without prejudice to, and after giving effect to, any contractual netting or set-off provision contained in the relevant Hedge Agreement and shall not in any way restrict the release of collateral granted thereunder in whole or in part at any time pursuant to the terms thereof);
(vii) a first fixed charge over all moneys held from time to time by the Principal Paying Agent and any other Agent for payment of principal, interest or other amounts on the Notes (if any);
(viii) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer's present and future rights under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, each Collateral Acquisition Agreement, each other Transaction Document and each Reporting Delegation Agreement, and, in each case, all sums derived therefrom; and
(ix) a floating charge over the whole of the Issuer's undertaking and assets to the extent that such undertaking and assets are not subject to any other security created pursuant to the Trust Deed,
excluding for the purpose of (i) to (ix) (inclusive) above, all of the Issuer's rights in respect of the Irish Excluded Assets.
The security created pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (ix) (inclusive) above is granted to the Trustee for itself and as trustee for the Secured Parties as continuing security for the payment of the Secured Obligations provided that the security granted by the Issuer over any collateral provided to the Issuer pursuant to a Hedge Agreement will only be available to the Secured Parties (other than with respect to the collateral provided to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to such Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts)) when such collateral is expressed to be available to the Issuer pursuant to the Hedge Agreement and
Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and (if a title transfer arrangement) to the extent that no equivalent amount is owed to the Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the relevant Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The security will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Issuer in respect of the above, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
If, for any reason, the purported assignment by way of security of, and/or the grant of first fixed charges over, the property, assets, rights and/or benefits described above is found to be ineffective in respect of any such property, assets, rights and/or benefits (together, the "Affected Collateral"), the Issuer shall hold to the fullest extent permitted under Irish or any other mandatory law the benefit of the Affected Collateral and any sums received in respect thereof or any security interest, guarantee or indemnity or undertaking of whatever nature given to secure such Affected Collateral (together, the "Trust Collateral") on trust for the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall (i) account to the Trustee for or otherwise apply all sums received in respect of such Trust Collateral as the Trustee may direct (provided that, subject to the Conditions and the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, if no Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall be entitled to apply the benefit of such Trust Collateral and such sums in respect of such Trust Collateral received by it and held on trust under this paragraph without prior direction from the Trustee), (ii) exercise any rights it may have in respect of the Trust Collateral at the direction of the Trustee and (iii) at its own cost take such action and execute such documents as the Trustee may in its sole discretion require.
The Issuer may from time to time grant security:
(1) by way of a first priority security interest to a Hedge Counterparty over a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral deposited by such Hedge Counterparty in the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account as security for the Issuer's obligations to pay any amounts pursuant to the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between such third party, the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and the Trustee); and/or
(2) by way of first priority security interest over amounts representing all or part of the Unfunded Amount of any Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and deposited in its name with a third party as security for any reimbursement or indemnification obligation of the Issuer owed to any other lender under such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, subject to the terms of Condition 3(l)(vii) (The Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account).
in each case, excluding all of the Issuer's rights in respect of the Irish Excluded Assets.
All deeds, documents, assignments, instruments, bonds, notes, negotiable instruments, papers and any other instruments comprising, evidencing, representing and/or transferring the Portfolio will be deposited with or held by or on behalf of the Custodian until the security over such obligations is irrevocably discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed. In the event that the ratings of the Custodian are downgraded to below the Rating Requirement or withdrawn, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that a replacement Custodian which satisfies the Rating Requirement is appointed on substantially the same terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed, the Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction in value of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure the Collateral and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held in a clearing system or in safe custody by the Custodian, a bank or other custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for ensuring that the Custodian, the Account Bank, the Principal Paying Agent or any Hedge Counterparty satisfies the Rating Requirement applicable to it or, in the event of its failure to satisfy such Rating Requirement, to procure the appointment of a replacement custodian, account bank, principal paying agent or hedge counterparty. The Trustee has no responsibility
for the management of the Portfolio by the Portfolio Manager or to supervise the administration of the Portfolio by the Collateral Administrator or by any other party and is entitled to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without enquiry or liability. The Trust Deed also provides that the Trustee shall accept without investigation, requisition or objection such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
(b) Application of Proceeds upon Enforcement
The Trust Deed provides that the net proceeds of realisation of or enforcement with respect to the security over the Collateral constituted by the Trust Deed shall be applied in accordance with the priorities of payment set out in Condition 11 (Enforcement).
(c) Limited Recourse and Non-Petition
The obligations of the Issuer to pay amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties at any time shall be limited to the proceeds available at such time to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Conditions or any other Transaction Document, if the net proceeds of realisation of the security constituted by the Trust Deed, upon enforcement thereof in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the provisions of the Trust Deed or otherwise are less than the aggregate amount payable in such circumstances by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties (such negative amount being referred to herein as a "shortfall"), the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of each Class and its obligations to the other Secured Parties in such circumstances will be limited to such net proceeds, which shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In such circumstances, the other assets (including the Irish Excluded Assets) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall which shall be borne by the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Reinvesting Noteholders (if any), the Subordinated Noteholders and the other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (applied in reverse order). In such circumstances the rights of the Secured Parties to receive any further amounts in respect of such obligations shall be extinguished and none of the Noteholders of each Class or the other Secured Parties may take any further action to recover such amounts. None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee, the other Secured Parties (or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, examinership, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee's right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
In addition, none of the Noteholders or any of the other Secured Parties shall have any recourse against any director, shareholder or officer of the Issuer in respect of any obligations, covenants or agreements entered into or made by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of these Conditions or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party or any notice or documents which it is requested to deliver hereunder or thereunder. It is expressly agreed and understood that the Transaction Documents are corporate obligations of the Issuer. No personal liability shall attach to or be incurred by any director, shareholder or other officer of the Issuer, under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements of the Issuer contained in the Transaction Documents and any and all personal liability of every such director, shareholder, or officer of the Issuer for breaches by the Issuer of any such obligations, covenants or agreements, either at law or by statute or constitution is hereby expressly waived by the parties hereto.
None of the Trustee, the Directors, the Issuer Corporate Services Provider, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator and any Agent has any obligation to any Noteholder of any Class for payment of any amount by the Issuer in respect of the Notes of any Class.
The terms of this Condition shall survive any cancellation or redemption of the Notes.
(d) Exercise of Rights in Respect of the Portfolio
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer authorises the Portfolio Manager, prior to enforcement of the security over the Collateral, to exercise all rights and remedies of the Issuer in its capacity as a holder of, or person beneficially entitled to, the Portfolio. In particular, the Portfolio Manager is authorised, subject to any specific direction given by the Issuer, to attend and vote at any meeting of holders of, or other persons interested or participating in, or entitled to the rights or benefits (or a part thereof) under, the Portfolio and to give any consent, waiver, indulgence, time or notification, make any declaration or agree any composition, compounding or other similar arrangement with respect to any obligations forming part of the Portfolio.
(e) Information Regarding the Collateral The Issuer shall procure that a copy of:
(i) each Monthly Report and any Payment Date Report is made available to any person that certifies (in the form set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, which certificate may be given electronically and upon which the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is:
(A) the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Initial Purchaser, a Hedge Counterparty, a Rating Agency or a Noteholder; and
(B) a potential investor in the Notes or a competent authority (as determined under the Securitisation Regulation); and
(ii) following the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date only, each Portfolio Report and Investor Report is made available to each person that certifies (in the form set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, which certificate may be given electronically and upon which the Collateral Administrator may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it is the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Initial Purchaser, a Hedge Counterparty, a Rating Agency, a Noteholder, a potential investor in the Notes or a competent authority (as determined under the Securitisation Regulation),
in each case, within two Business Days of publication thereof in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
(f) Securitisation Regulation
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to be designated as the entity required to fulfil the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Issuer will assume all costs of complying with the EU Disclosure Requirements (including the properly incurred costs and expenses (including legal fees) of all parties incurred in connection with any amendment of the Transaction Documents for this purpose) and shall reimburse each of the Portfolio Manager, the Originator and the Collateral Administrator for any such costs incurred by the Portfolio Manager, the Originator or the Collateral Administrator in connection with the preparation and filing of such information and reports required pursuant to the provisions of the Securitisation Regulation, such costs to be paid as Trustee Fees and Expenses and/or Administrative Expenses, as applicable.

(v) maintain its place of effective management only in Ireland and in particular shall seek to ensure that it is not treated under any of the double taxation treaties entered into by Ireland as being resident in any jurisdiction other than Ireland, and that it does not have a permanent establishment or a branch or agency in any jurisdiction other than Ireland under the laws or guidelines of any jurisdiction (other than Ireland);

(viii) ensure that the first assets to be acquired, held or managed by the Issuer, or in respect of which legally enforceable arrangements are to be entered into by the Issuer with another person which arrangements themselves constitute "qualifying assets" within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA ("Qualifying Assets"), are Qualifying Assets
and that they will have a market value of not less than EUR10,000,000 on the day that they are first acquired, first held, or such legally enforceable arrangement is first entered into, by the Issuer and the Issuer shall ensure that it will not transact any business prior to the acquisition, holding, managing or entering into of such assets (as the case may be);

The Rated Notes each bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable (A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling on or about January 2021, (B) in respect of each six month Accrual Period, semi-annually and (C) in respect of each three month Accrual Period, quarterly, in each case in arrear on each Payment Date.
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Interest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes to the extent funds are available in accordance with paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments, paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments and paragraph (X) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments on each Payment Date or other relevant payment date and shall continue to be payable in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) notwithstanding redemption in full of any Subordinated Note at its applicable Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the Trust Deed, all references herein and therein to the Subordinated Notes being redeemed in full or at their Principal Amount Outstanding shall be deemed to be amended to the extent required to ensure that a minimum of €1 principal amount of each such Class of Notes remains Outstanding at all times and any amounts which are to be applied in redemption of each such Class of Notes pursuant hereto which are in excess of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof minus €1 shall constitute interest payable in respect of such Notes and shall not be applied in redemption of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof, provided always however that such €1 principal shall no longer remain Outstanding and each such Class of Notes shall be redeemed in full on the date
on which all of the Collateral securing the Notes has been realised and is to be finally distributed to the Noteholders.
(b) Interest Accrual
(i) Rated Notes
Each Rated Note (or, as the case may be, the relevant part thereof due to be redeemed) will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, it shall continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder and (B) the day following seven days after the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent has notified the Noteholders of such Class of Notes in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes of such Class up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Payments on the Subordinated Notes will cease to be payable in respect of each Subordinated Note upon the date that all of the Collateral has been realised and no Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral remain available for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(c) Deferral of Interest
The Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes in full on any Payment Date in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount which would, but for the first paragraph of this Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) otherwise be due and payable in respect of such Class on any Payment Date (each such amount being referred to as "Deferred Interest") will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class, and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will not be a Note Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Notes are to be redeemed in full.
(d) Payment of Deferred Interest
Deferred Interest in respect of any Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note shall only become payable by the Issuer in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of the Interest Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments and the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and under the Note Payment Sequence in each place specified in the Priorities of Payment, to the extent that Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, as applicable, or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral, are available to make such payment in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (and, if applicable, the Note Payment Sequence). Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will be added to the principal amount of the relevant Class, as applicable. An amount equal to any such Deferred Interest so paid shall be subtracted from the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes, as applicable.
(e) Interest on the Rated Notes
(i) Floating Rate of Interest
The rate of interest from time to time in respect of the Class A Notes (the "Class A Rate of Interest"), in respect of the Class B-1 Notes (the "Class B-1 Rate of Interest"), in respect of the Class C Notes (the "Class C Rate of Interest"), in respect of the Class D Notes (the "Class D Rate of Interest"), in respect of the Class E Notes (the "Class E Rate of Interest") and in respect of the Class F Notes (the "Class F Rate of Interest") will in each case be determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:
(A) On each Interest Determination Date:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, the Calculation Agent will determine a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for 6-month and 12-month Euro deposits;
(2) in the case of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine (i) the offered rate for six month Euro deposits and (ii) the offered rate for three month Euro deposits; and
(3) in the case of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for six month Euro deposits,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question ("EURIBOR"). Such offered rate will be that which appears on the display designated on the Bloomberg Screen "BTMM EU" Page (or such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying EURIBOR rates). The Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest for each Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (as defined below) and in respect of
(i) the initial Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (1) above; and
(ii) each six month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (2)(i) or
(3) above (as applicable); and (iii) each three month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (2)(ii) above, in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent.
If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then paragraph (A) shall be applied, with any necessary consequential changes, to the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not so appear, or if the relevant page is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of four major banks in the Euro zone interbank market (selected by the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer) acting in each case through its principal Euro zone office (the "Reference Banks") to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market:
(a) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, for a straight line interpolation of the offered quotation for 6-month and 12-month Euro deposits;
(b) in respect of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of (i) six months and (ii) three months; and
(c) in respect of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of six months,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (if any) and the arithmetic mean, in each case, (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of, in respect of
(i) the initial Accrual Period; the quotations referred to in paragraph (a) above; and (ii) each six month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (b)(i) or (c) above (as applicable); and (iii) each three month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) above (or of such quotations, being at least two, as are so provided), all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(B) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides such quotations, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest, respectively, for the next Accrual Period shall be the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest in each case in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period; provided that in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date.
(C) Where:
"Applicable Margin" means:
(i) in the case of the Class A Notes: 1.75 per cent. per annum (the "Class A Margin");
(ii) in the case of the Class B-1 Notes: 2.20 per cent. per annum (the "Class B-1 Margin");
(iii) in the case of the Class C Notes: 2.80 per cent. per annum (the "Class C Margin");
(iv) in the case of the Class D Notes: 4.20 per cent. per annum (the "Class D Margin");
(v) in the case of the Class E Notes: 6.58 per cent. per annum (the "Class E Margin"); and
(vi) in the case of the Class F Notes: 7.47 per cent. per annum (the "Class F Margin").
(D) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B) above, if, in relation to any Interest Determination Date, EURIBOR in respect of any Class of Rated Notes as determined in accordance with paragraphs (A) and (B) above would yield a rate less than zero, such EURIBOR rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of determining the Floating Rate of Interest pursuant to this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest).
(ii) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable (and in any event (i) for each Accrual Period following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, not later than the Business Day following the relevant Interest Determination Date; and (ii) for each Accrual Period prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and for any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, not later than the Determination Date immediately preceding the relevant Payment Date), determine the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest and calculate the interest amount payable in respect of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The amount of interest (a "Floating Rate Interest Amount") payable in respect of each Authorised Integral Amount applicable to any such Notes shall be calculated by applying the Class A Rate of Interest in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest in the case of the Class B-1 Notes, the Class C Rate of Interest in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Rate of Interest in the case of the Class D Notes, the Class E Rate of Interest in the case of the Class E Notes, the Class F Rate of Interest in the case of the Class F Notes, respectively, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of such Authorised Integral Amount, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned, divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
(iii) Calculation of Fixed Amounts
The Calculation Agent will calculate the amount of interest (a "Fixed Rate Interest Amount" and together with the Floating Rate Interest Amount, an "Interest Amount") payable in respect of the Class B-2 Fixed Rate in the case of the Class B-2 Notes, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of the relevant Class of Notes, multiplying the product by the number of days in the Accrual Period concerned (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 months of 30 days each), divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards),
where:
"Class B-2 Fixed Rate" means 2.65 per cent. per annum.
(iv) Reference Banks and Calculation Agent
The Issuer will procure that, so long as any Class A Note, Class B-1 Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note remains Outstanding:
(A) a Calculation Agent shall be appointed and maintained for the purposes of determining the interest rate and interest amount payable in respect of the Notes; and
(B) in the event that the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest are to be calculated by Reference Banks pursuant to paragraph (2) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), that the number of Reference Banks required pursuant to such paragraph (2) are requested to provide a quotation.
If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the purpose of calculating interest hereunder or fails duly to establish any Rate of Interest for any Accrual Period, or to calculate the Interest Amount on any Class of Rated Notes, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the Trustee) appoint some other leading bank to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor having been so appointed.
(f) Interest Proceeds in respect of Subordinated Notes
Solely in respect of Subordinated Notes, the Collateral Administrator will as of each Determination Date calculate the Interest Proceeds payable to the extent of available funds in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The Interest Proceeds payable on each Payment Date in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of Interest Proceeds to be applied on the Subordinated Notes on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments, paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments and paragraph (X) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments by fractions equal to the amount of such Authorised Integral Amount, as applicable, divided by the aggregate original principal amount of the Subordinated Notes.
(g) Publication of Rates of Interest, Interest Amounts and Deferred Interest
The Calculation Agent will cause the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B-1 Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest or the Interest Amounts payable in respect of each Class of Rated Notes, the amount of any Deferred Interest due but not paid on any Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes for each Accrual Period and Payment Date, and following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event on any Frequency Switch Measurement Date, and the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes as of the applicable Payment Date, to be notified to the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager, as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter, and the Principal Paying Agent shall cause each such rate, amount and date and occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event to be notified to the Noteholders of each Class in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible following notification to the Principal Paying Agent but in no event later than the third Business Day after such notification. The Interest Amounts in respect of the Rated Notes or the Payment Date in respect of any Class so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made with the consent of the Trustee by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Accrual Period. If any of the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10 (Events of Default), interest shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) but no publication of the applicable Interest Amounts shall be made unless the Trustee so determines.
(h) Notifications, etc. to be Final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Calculation Agent, will be binding on the Issuer, the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and all Noteholders (save in the case that the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without liability) that any such notification, opinion, determination, certificate, quotation or decisions given, expressed, made or obtained is erroneous and, if applicable, the Issuer publishes a correction in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), provided that the Trustee shall be under no obligation to monitor or investigate any such notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions for such errors) and no liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders of any Class shall attach to the Reference Banks or the Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 6(h) (Notifications, etc. to be Final).
7. Redemption and Purchase
(a) Final Redemption
Subject to Condition 6(a)(ii) (Subordinated Notes), save to the extent previously redeemed in full and cancelled, the Notes of each Class will be redeemed on the Maturity Date of such Notes at their Redemption Price in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of
Payment. Notes may not be redeemed other than in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

(v) Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing
Following receipt of, or, as the case may be, confirmation from the Principal Paying Agent of receipt of a direction in writing from the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or a direction in writing from the Originator or the Portfolio Manager, in each case, to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) or Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Portfolio Manager/Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) (as applicable) and provided the Subordinated Noteholders have not objected to any such exercise by the Originator in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator), the Issuer may, subject to the consent of the Portfolio Manager:
(A) in the case of a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes (1), enter into a loan (as borrower thereunder) with one or more financial institutions; or (2) issue replacement notes; and
(B) in the case of a redemption in part of the entire Class of a Class of Rated Notes, issue replacement notes, (each, a "Refinancing Obligation"),
whose terms in each case will be negotiated by the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer (any such refinancing, a "Refinancing"). The terms of any Refinancing are subject to the prior written consent of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) and each Refinancing is required to satisfy the conditions described in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).
Refinancing Proceeds may be applied in addition to (or in place of) Sale Proceeds in the redemption of the Rated Notes in whole pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator).

In the case of a Refinancing in relation to the redemption of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole - Subordinated Noteholders/Originator) as described above, such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to S&P and Fitch;
(2) all Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Trustee Fees and Expenses that are Refinancing Costs and any Administrative Expenses that are Refinancing Costs) and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes save for the Subordinated Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of the Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments;
(3) all Principal Proceeds, Refinancing Proceeds, Sale Proceeds, if any, and other available funds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;

(5) all Refinancing Proceeds and all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date;
(6) the issuance of Refinancing Obligations would not result in non- compliance by the Originator with the EU Retention Requirements; and
(7) the issuance of Refinancing Obligations would not result in non- compliance by the Portfolio Manager with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules,
in each case, as confirmed in writing to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Portfolio Manager (upon which confirmation the Trustee shall rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability).
(B) Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Part
In the case of a Refinancing in relation to a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Portfolio Manager/Subordinated Noteholders/Originator), such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to S&P and Fitch;
(2) the Refinancing Obligations are in the form of notes;
(3) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption and, if the Class B-1 Notes or the Class B-2 Notes are subject to such redemption, the Class B- 2 Notes or the Class B-1 Notes, respectively, must also be subject to such redemption;
(4) the sum of (A) the Refinancing Proceeds and (B) the amount of Interest Proceeds standing to the credit of the Interest Account in excess of the aggregate amount of Interest Proceeds which would be applied in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments prior to paying any amount in respect of the Subordinated Notes on the immediately following Payment Date, will be at least sufficient to pay in full:
(a) the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption; plus
(b) all accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses in connection with such Refinancing;
(5) the Refinancing Proceeds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(6) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed;
(7) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Obligations for each Class is equal to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of such Class of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds;
(8) the maturity date of each class of Refinancing Obligation is the same as the Maturity Date of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds;
(9) (a) the margin applicable to any Refinancing Obligations for the purposes of determining the relevant interest rate will be equal to or less than the margin applicable to the Rated Notes subject to such Optional Redemption, or, (b) if either (i) any of the Notes being redeemed are Fixed Rate Notes, and the related Refinancing Obligations are floating rate obligations, or (ii) any of the Notes being redeemed are Floating Rate Notes, and the related Refinancing Obligations are fixed rate obligations, the interest payable on all such Refinancing Obligations is expected (in the reasonable determination of the Portfolio Manager) to be less than the interest that would have been payable on the Notes being redeemed over the expected remaining life of such Notes being redeemed (in each case determined on a weighted average basis over such expected remaining life), had such redemption in part not occurred;
(10) payments in respect of the Refinancing Obligations are subject to the Priorities of Payment and rank at the same priority pursuant to the Priorities of Payment than the relevant Class or Classes of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(11) the voting rights, consent rights, redemption rights (other than any modification to remove the right of the Subordinated Noteholder or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem by refinancing such Refinancing Obligations) and all other rights of the Refinancing Obligations are the same as the rights of the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(12) all Refinancing Proceeds are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and
(13) the issuance of Refinancing Obligations would not result in non- compliance by the Originator with the EU Retention Requirements; and
(14) the issuance of Refinancing Obligations would not result in non- compliance by the Portfolio Manager with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules,
in each case, as confirmed in writing to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Portfolio Manager (upon which confirmation the Trustee shall rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) and, in the case of paragraph (9)(b) above, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation is received with respect to any Class or Classes (or tranche or tranches, as applicable) of Rated Notes that are not being redeemed.
If, in relation to a proposed optional redemption of the Notes (in part or in whole, as applicable), any of the relevant conditions specified in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the relevant redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
None of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee shall be liable to any party, including the Subordinated Noteholders, for any failure to obtain a Refinancing, and any such failure shall not constitute a Note Event of Default.
(C) Consequential Amendments
Following a Refinancing, the Issuer and the Trustee shall agree to the modification of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents to the extent which the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) certifies to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee shall rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) is necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing (including any modification to remove the right of the Subordinated Noteholders, or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem by Refinancing the Refinancing Obligations). No further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of Notes.
The Trustee will not be obliged to enter into any modification that, in its opinion, would (i) have the effect of exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction or (ii) add to or increase the obligations, liabilities, duties or decrease the protections, rights, powers, indemnities, discretions or authorisations of the Trustee in respect of any Transaction Document, and the Trustee will be entitled to conclusively rely upon an officer's certificate and/or opinion of counsel as to matters of law (which may be supported as to factual (including financial and capital markets) matters by any relevant certificates and other documents necessary or advisable in the judgement of counsel delivering such opinion of counsel) provided by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager to the effect that such amendment meets the requirements specified above and is permitted under the Trust Deed without the consent of the holders of the Notes (except that such counsel will have no obligation to opine as to the sufficiency of the Refinancing Proceeds).
(vi) Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only
Following receipt of notice from the Issuer or, as the case may be, of confirmation from the Principal Paying Agent of (i) a direction in writing from the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or the Originator, (ii) a direction
in writing from the Controlling Class (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) and/or
(iii) consent of or direction from (where required) the Portfolio Manager, as the case may be, subject to and in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), and in each case in writing, to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Collateral, the Collateral Administrator (in consultation with the Portfolio Manager) shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 15 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date (the "Redemption Determination Date"), provided that the Collateral Administrator has received such notice or confirmation at least 20 Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, calculate the Redemption Threshold Amount in consultation with the Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager, the Originator or any Portfolio Manager Related Person will be permitted to purchase Collateral Obligations in the Portfolio where the Noteholders or the Originator exercise their or its right of early redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event).
The Notes shall not be optionally redeemed where such Optional Redemption is to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Portfolio unless:
(A) at least five Business Days before the scheduled Redemption Date (or such shorter date as agreed between the Portfolio Manager and the Collateral Administrator and no consent for such shorter period shall be required from the Trustee) the Portfolio Manager shall have furnished to the Trustee a certificate (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without further enquiry or liability) signed by an officer of the Portfolio Manager that the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer has entered into a binding agreement or agreements with either (I) a financial or other institution or institutions (which (a) either (x) has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least "A" by S&P, a short-term issuer credit rating of at least "A-1" by S&P or (y) in respect of which Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P has been obtained and (b) either (x) has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least "A" by Fitch or, if it does not have a long-term issuer credit rating by Fitch, a short-term issuer default rating of at least "F1" by Fitch or, (y) in respect of which a Rating Agency Confirmation from Fitch has been obtained) or (II) subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from both S&P and Fitch, a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle with sufficient available funding capacity, in each case to purchase (directly or by participation or other arrangement) from the Issuer, not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Redemption Date, in immediately available funds, all or part of the Portfolio at a purchase price at least sufficient, together with the Eligible Investments maturing, redeemable or putable to the issuer thereof at par on or prior to the scheduled Redemption Date and, without double counting, amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts that will be available for payment in accordance with the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments on the scheduled Redemption Date, to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount;
(B) at least the Business Day before the scheduled Redemption Date, the Issuer shall have received proceeds of disposition of all or part of the Portfolio at least sufficient, together with the Eligible Investments maturing, redeemable or putable to the issuer thereof at par on or prior to the scheduled Redemption Date and, without double counting, amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts that will be available for payment in accordance with the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments on the scheduled Redemption Date, to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount, provided that, if the Issuer has received funds from a purchaser of one or more Collateral Obligations (in whole or in part), but such Collateral Obligations have not yet been disposed of by transfer of legal title, such funds will be included within the calculation of whether the Redemption Threshold Amount has been met; and
(C) prior to selling any Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments, the Portfolio Manager confirms in writing to the Trustee that, in its judgement, the aggregate sum of (A) expected proceeds from the sale of Eligible Investments, (B) for each Collateral Obligation, the product of its Principal Balance and its Market Value and (C) without double counting, amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts that will be available for payment in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments on the scheduled Redemption Date, shall meet or exceed the Redemption Threshold Amount.
Any certification delivered by the Portfolio Manager pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only) must include (1) the prices on the date of such certification of, and expected proceeds from, the sale (directly or by participation or other arrangement) of any Collateral Obligations and/or Eligible Investments, (2) amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts which would be available to be applied in accordance with the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments if the Notes fell due for redemption in full on the scheduled Redemption Date and (3) all calculations required by this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) (as applicable). Any Noteholder, the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person shall have the right, subject to the same terms and conditions afforded to other bidders, to bid on Collateral Obligations to be sold as part of an Optional Redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only).
If any of the conditions (A) to (C) above are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Such cancellation shall not constitute a Note Event of Default.
The Trustee shall rely conclusively and without liability on any confirmation or certificate of the Portfolio Manager furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only).
(vii) Mechanics of Redemption
Following calculation by the Collateral Administrator of the relevant Redemption Threshold Amount (in consultation with the Portfolio Manager), if applicable, the Collateral Administrator (in consultation with the Portfolio Manager) shall make such other calculations as it is required to make pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager and the Principal Paying Agent (who shall notify the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of such amounts).
Any exercise of a right of Optional Redemption by the Subordinated Noteholders or the Originator pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) shall be effected by delivery to the Principal Paying Agent, by the requisite amount of Subordinated Noteholders or the requisite amount of Notes comprising the Controlling Class (as applicable) held thereby, of duly completed Redemption Notices, or by the Originator of a written direction to the Issuer, as applicable, not less than 45 calendar days prior (or, in respect of Optional Redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b)(ii) (Optional Redemption in Part – Portfolio Manager/Subordinated Noteholders), no less than 30 calendar days prior) to the proposed Redemption Date. No Redemption Notice so delivered or any direction given by the Originator (subject as provided below) may be withdrawn without the prior consent of the Issuer. The Registrar shall copy each Redemption Notice or any direction given by the Originator received to each of the Issuer (who shall provide a copy of each such Redemption Notice to each Hedge Counterparty), the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Portfolio Manager.
The Portfolio Manager shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and the Principal Paying Agent upon satisfaction of all of the conditions set out in this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) and shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to arrange for liquidation and/or realisation of the Portfolio in whole or in part as necessary, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The Issuer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the funds required for an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and/or Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) in the Payment Account on or before the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date (or in the case of a Refinancing, on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date). Principal Proceeds and Interest Proceeds received in connection with a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes shall be payable in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments. In the case of any redemption in whole of a Class of Rated Notes, the relevant Refinancing Proceeds (other than a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes) shall be paid to the Noteholders of such Class of Notes subject to payment of amounts in priority in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Where the Originator has directed the Issuer to effect a redemption in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption), the Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee, each Hedge Counterparty and the Noteholders thereof in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of such direction and, in such notice to the Noteholders, shall notify the Noteholders the manner by which the Subordinated Noteholders may object to such redemption. Unless the requisite amount of Subordinated Noteholders deliver duly completed notices of objection to such Optional Redemption to the Principal Paying Agent in accordance with these Conditions and the Trust Deed in each case no later than 10 Business Days after having received such notice of redemption from the Issuer (such notice to be deemed to have been received by each Subordinated Noteholder on the Business Day following the date of delivery by the Principal Paying Agent to the Clearing Systems for onward transmission to beneficial owners in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the Trust Deed), any Optional Redemption so notified and instructed by the Originator shall be irrevocable and shall occur on the Redemption Date therefor in accordance with these Conditions, provided that the Originator has not rescinded such notice of Optional Redemption by written notice of rescission to the Issuer no later than two Business Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date.
(viii) Optional Redemption of Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) or at the direction of the Originator.
(c) Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests
(i) Class A Notes and Class B Notes
If the Class A/B Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or if the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payments of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.

(d) Special Redemption
Principal payments on the Notes shall be made in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments at the sole and absolute discretion of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer), if either (A) at any time during the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) to the Trustee that, using commercially reasonable endeavours, it has been unable, for a period of 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion which meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account that are to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations, or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) notifies the Trustee in writing that, as determined by the Portfolio Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner, a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event (upon which notification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) (a "Special Redemption"). On the first Payment Date following the Due Period in which such notification is given (a "Special Redemption Date") (A) the funds in the Principal Account representing Principal Proceeds which, using commercially reasonable endeavours, cannot be reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations by the Portfolio Manager or (B) such minimum amount of funds in the Principal Account as the Portfolio Manager determines, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, is required to avoid the occurrence of a Rating Event (each amount under (A) and (B), a "Special Redemption Amount") will be applied in accordance with paragraph (O) of the Principal Priority of Payments. Notice of payments pursuant to this Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption) shall be given by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) not less than three Business Days prior to the applicable Special Redemption Date to the Noteholders and to each Rating Agency. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of a Special Redemption shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Portfolio
Manager shall be under no obligation to, or have any responsibility to, any Noteholder or any other person for the exercise or non-exercise (as applicable) of such Special Redemption.
(e) Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event
In the event that as at the Business Day prior to the Payment Date following the Effective Date, an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, in each case, until redeemed in full or, if earlier, until an Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing.
(f) Redemption Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period
Following expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Issuer shall, on each Payment Date occurring thereafter, apply Principal Proceeds transferred to the Payment Account immediately prior to the related Payment Date in redemption of the Notes at their applicable Redemption Prices in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(g) Redemption Following Note Tax Event
Upon the occurrence of a Note Tax Event, the Issuer shall, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to remedy that Note Tax Event (which may include changing the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would prevent the continuation of a Note Tax Event). Upon the earlier of (a) the date upon which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) and the Noteholders that it is not able to remedy the Note Tax Event and (b) the date which is 90 calendar days from the date upon which the Issuer first becomes aware of such Note Tax Event (provided that such 90 calendar day period shall be extended by a further 90 calendar days in the event that during the former period the Issuer has notified (or procured the notification of) the Trustee and the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) that, based on advice received by it, it expects that it shall have remedied the Note Tax Event by the end of the latter 90 calendar day period) (i) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution or (ii) the Originator may direct that the Notes of each Class are redeemed, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day thereafter, at their respective Redemption Prices in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in which case the Issuer shall so redeem the Notes on such terms, provided that such Note Tax Event would affect payment of principal or interest in respect of the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, the Subordinated Notes (in addition to any other Class of Notes) on such Payment Date; provided further that such redemption of the Notes, whether pursuant to the exercise of such option by the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, shall take place subject to and in accordance with the procedures set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only)).
(h) Redemption
Unless otherwise specified in this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), all Notes in respect of which any notice of redemption is given shall be redeemed on the Redemption Date at their applicable Redemption Prices and to the extent specified in such notice and in accordance with the requirements of this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(i) Cancellation and Purchase
All Notes redeemed in full by the Issuer will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.
No Note may be surrendered (including in connection with any abandonment, donation, gift, contribution or other event or circumstance) except for payment as provided herein or for cancellation pursuant to Condition 7(l) (Purchase) below, for registration of transfer, exchange or redemption, or for replacement in connection with any Note mutilated, defaced or deemed lost or stolen.
In respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate, cancellation of any Note required by the Conditions to be cancelled will be effected by reduction in the principal amount of the Notes on the Register, with a corresponding notation made on the applicable Global Certificate.
(j) Notice of Redemption
The Issuer shall procure that notice of any redemption in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) (which notice shall be irrevocable) is given in writing to the Trustee and Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and promptly in writing to the Rating Agencies.

No purchase of Rated Notes by the Issuer may occur unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:
(A) such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur in the following sequential order of priority: first, the Class A Notes until the Class A Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled; second, the Class B Notes until the Class B Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled; third, the Class C Notes, until the Class C Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled; fourth, the Class D Notes, until the Class D Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled; fifth, the Class E Notes, until the Class E Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled; and sixth, the Class F Notes, until the Class F Notes are purchased or redeemed in full and cancelled;
(B) (1) each such purchase of Rated Notes of any Class shall be made pursuant to an offer made to all holders of the Rated Notes of such Class, by notice to such holders, which notice shall specify the purchase price (as a percentage of par) at which such purchase will be effected, the amount of Supplemental Reserve Amounts and/or Principal Proceeds that will be used to effect such purchase and the length of the period during which such offer will be open for acceptance;
(2) each such holder of a Rated Note shall have the right, but not the obligation, to accept such offer in accordance with its terms; and
(3) if the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes of the relevant Class held by holders who accept such offer exceeds the amount of Supplemental Reserve Amounts and/or Principal Proceeds specified in such offer, a portion of the Notes of each accepting holder shall be purchased pro rata based on the respective Principal Amount Outstanding held by each such holder subject to adjustment for Authorised Denominations if required;
(C) each such purchase shall be effected only at prices discounted from par;
(D) each Coverage Test is satisfied immediately prior to each such purchase and will be satisfied after giving effect to such purchase (and subsequent cancellation pursuant to this Condition 7(l) (Purchase)) or, if any Coverage Test is not satisfied, it shall be at least maintained or improved after giving effect to such purchase (and subsequent cancellation pursuant to this Condition 7(l) (Purchase)) compared with what it was immediately prior thereto;
(E) no Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(F) any Rated Notes to be purchased shall be surrendered to the Registrar for cancellation and may not be reissued or resold;
(G) each such purchase will otherwise be conducted in accordance with applicable law (including the laws of Ireland); and
(H) if such purchase is to occur following the Reinvestment Period, the prior consent of the Controlling Class (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) has been obtained.
Upon instruction by the Issuer, the Registrar shall cancel any such purchased Rated Notes surrendered to it for cancellation. The cancellation (and/or decrease, as applicable) of any such surrendered Rated Notes shall be taken into account for purposes of all relevant calculations. The Issuer shall procure that notice of any such purchase of Rated Notes by it is given promptly in writing to the Rating Agencies, the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and the Trustee.
8. Payments
(a) Method of Payment
Payments of principal upon final redemption in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such Note at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent by wire transfer. Payments of interest on each Note and, prior to redemption in full thereof, principal in respect of each Note, will be made by wire transfer. Upon application of the holder to the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent not less than five Business Days before the due date for any payment in respect of a Note, the payment may be made (in the case of any final payment of principal against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only of such final payment, endorsement) of such Note as provided above) by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, on the due date to a Euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in Western Europe.
Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate will be made to the registered holder as shall have been notified to the relevant Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) for such purpose and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the relevant Notes, upon surrender of such Global Certificate to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent. On each occasion on which a payment of interest (unless the Notes represented thereby do not bear interest) or principal is made in respect of the relevant Global Certificate, the Registrar shall note the same in the Register and cause the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by a Global Certificate to be decreased accordingly.
(b) Payments
All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives (including FATCA), but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation). No commission shall be charged to the Noteholders.
(c) Payments on Presentation Days
A holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a Presentation Date and shall not, except as provided in Condition 6 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a Presentation Date falls after the due date.
If a Note is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones it is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.
(d) Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agent
The names of the initial Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agent and their initial specified offices are set out below. The Issuer reserves the right at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Principal Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent and appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will maintain a Principal Paying Agent, as approved in writing by the Trustee, and shall procure that it shall at all times maintain a Custodian, Account Bank, Portfolio Manager and Collateral Administrator. Notice of any change in any Agent or their specified offices or in the Portfolio Manager or Collateral Administrator will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
9. Taxation
All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within Ireland or any other jurisdiction, or (in each case) any political sub-division or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to gross up any payments made to Noteholders of any Class and shall withhold or deduct from any such payments any amounts on account of such tax where so required by law (including FATCA) or any such relevant taxing authority. Any withholding or deduction shall not constitute a Note Event of Default under Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default).
Subject as provided below, if the Issuer certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry or liability) to the Trustee that it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes of any Class become obliged by the laws of Ireland to withhold or account for tax so that it would be unable to make payment of the full amount that would otherwise be due but for the imposition of such tax and that it is not otherwise able to remedy the Note Tax Event as contemplated by Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event), the Issuer (with the consent of the Trustee and save as provided below) shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange for the substitution of a company incorporated in another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee as the principal obligor under the Notes of such Class, or to change its tax residence to another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such change and to the satisfaction of certain conditions (as set out in the Trust Deed). The Trustee will not approve any such substitution or change in the place of residence of the Issuer under this Condition 9 (Taxation) unless the Trustee has received written advice from legal counsel or a tax expert (in each case) of recognised standing (such advice to be paid for by the Issuer) to the effect that such substitution or change in the place of residence of the Issuer will be effective to eliminate the imposition of the tax (for which the Issuer would otherwise be liable to withhold or account) and will not (1) result in the Issuer becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to its net income, (2) result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (3) have a material adverse effect on the tax treatment of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, if any taxes referred to in this Condition 9 (Taxation) arise:
(a) due to any present or former connection of any Noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Noteholder if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, or a corporation) with Ireland (including without limitation, such Noteholder (or
such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having had a permanent establishment therein) otherwise than by reason only of the holding of any Note or receiving principal or interest in respect thereof;
(b) by reason of the failure by the relevant Noteholder to comply with any applicable procedures required to establish non-residence or other similar claim for exemption from such tax or to provide information concerning nationality, residency or connection with Ireland or other applicable taxing authority;
(c) under FATCA or as a result of the Noteholder's failure to provide the Issuer with appropriate tax forms and other documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer; or
(d) any combination of the preceding clauses (a) through (c) inclusive,
the requirement to substitute the Issuer as a principal obligor and/or change its residence for taxation purposes shall not apply.
10. Events of Default
(a) Note Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute an "Note Event of Default":
(i) Non-payment of interest
the Issuer fails to pay any interest in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes when the same becomes due and payable (save, in each case, as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition or withholding thereon in the circumstances described in Condition 9 (Taxation)) and, in each case, the failure to pay such interest in such circumstances continues for a period of at least five Business Days provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least 10 Business Days after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission; provided further that the failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with these Conditions or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails, will not constitute a Note Event of Default;
(ii) Non-payment of principal
the Issuer fails to pay any principal when the same becomes due and payable (save, in each case, as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition or withholding thereon in the circumstances described in Condition 9 (Taxation)) on any Rated Note on the Maturity Date or any Redemption Date provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least 10 Business Days after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission and provided further that failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Conditions or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails, will not constitute a Note Event of Default;
(iii) Default under Priorities of Payment
the failure on any Payment Date to disburse amounts (other than (i) or (ii) above) available in the Payment Account in excess of €1,000 and payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and continuation of such failure for a period of five Business Days or, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission or another non-credit-related reason (as determined by the Portfolio Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner and certified in writing to the Trustee (upon which
certification the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability), but without liability as to such determination) by the Issuer or the Collateral Administrator, as the case may be, such failure continues for 10 Business Days after the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission;
(iv) Collateral Obligations
on any Measurement Date after the Effective Date, failure of the percentage equivalent of a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is equal to (1) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations plus (2) the aggregate in respect of each Defaulted Obligation of its Market Value multiplied by its Principal Balance on such date plus (3) any Principal Proceeds standing to the credit of the Principal Account on such Measurement Date and (ii) the denominator of which is equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes, to equal or exceed
102.5 per cent.;
(v) Breach of Other Obligations
except as otherwise provided in this definition of "Note Event of Default", a default in a material respect in the performance by, or breach in a material respect of any material covenant of, the Issuer under the Trust Deed and/or these Conditions (provided that any failure to meet any Portfolio Profile Test, Collateral Quality Test, Coverage Test or Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not a Note Event of Default and any failure to satisfy the Effective Date Determination Requirements is not a Note Event of Default, except in either case to the extent provided in paragraph (iv) above) or the failure of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other agreement of the Issuer made in the Trust Deed and/or these Conditions or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant thereto or in connection therewith to be correct in each case in all material respects when the same shall have been made, and the continuation of such default, breach or failure for a period of 30 calendar days after the earlier of (a) the Issuer having actual knowledge of such default, breach or failure or (b) notice being given to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager by registered or certified mail or courier from the Trustee, or to the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager and the Trustee from the Controlling Class acting pursuant to an Ordinary Resolution, in each case copied to the Trustee (as applicable), specifying such default, breach or failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under the Trust Deed; provided that if the Issuer (as notified to the Trustee by the Portfolio Manager in writing) has commenced curing such default, breach or failure during the 30 calendar day period specified above, such default, breach or failure shall not constitute a Note Event of Default under this paragraph (v) unless it continues for a period of 45 calendar days (rather than, and not in addition to, such 30 day period specified above) after the earlier of the Issuer having actual knowledge thereof or notice thereof in accordance herewith. For the purposes of this paragraph, the materiality of such default, breach, representation or warranty shall be determined by the Trustee;
(vi) Insolvency Proceedings

(b) Acceleration
If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, (subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) give notice to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable (such notice, an "Acceleration Notice"), whereupon the Notes shall become immediately due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices, provided that upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default described in paragraph (vi) of the definition thereof, an Acceleration Notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices.
(c) Curing of Default
At any time after an Acceleration Notice (whether deemed or otherwise) has been given pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) following the occurrence of a Note Event of Default and prior to enforcement of the security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement), the Trustee, subject to receipt of consent in writing from the Controlling Class, may and shall, if so requested by the Controlling Class, in each case, acting by Extraordinary Resolution (and subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) rescind and annul such Acceleration Notice under paragraph (b) above and its consequences if:
(i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or to its order) a sum sufficient to pay:
(A) all overdue payments of interest and principal on the Notes, other than the Subordinated Notes;
(B) all due but unpaid taxes owing by the Issuer, as certified by an Authorised Officer of the Issuer to the Trustee;
(C) all unpaid Administrative Expenses and Trustee Fees and Expenses in each case, without regard to the Senior Expenses Cap; and

Any previous rescission and annulment of an Acceleration Notice (whether deemed or otherwise) pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not prevent the subsequent acceleration of the
Notes if the Trustee, at its discretion or as subsequently requested, accelerates the Notes or if the Notes are automatically accelerated in accordance with paragraph (b) above.
All amounts received in respect of this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) shall be distributed two Business Days following receipt by the Trustee of payment or deposit from the Issuer, in accordance with paragraph (i) above and the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.
(d) Restriction on Acceleration
No direction to accelerate the Notes shall be permitted by any Class of Noteholders, other than the Controlling Class as provided in Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(e) Notification and Confirmation of No Default
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) and the Rating Agencies upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Note Event of Default. The Trust Deed contains provision for the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee and the Rating Agencies on an annual basis that no Note Event of Default has occurred and that no condition, event or act has occurred which, with the lapse of time and/or the issue, making or giving of any notice, certification, declaration and/or request and/or the taking of any similar action and/or the fulfilment of any similar condition would constitute a Note Event of Default and that no other matter which is required (pursuant thereto) to be brought to the Trustee's attention has occurred.
(f) Portfolio Manager Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute a "Portfolio Manager Event of Default":
(i) the Portfolio Manager wilfully breaches, or wilfully takes any action which it knows is in breach of any material provision of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (it being understood that any action or failure to act by the Portfolio Manager, including but not limited, to any decision to buy or sell a Collateral Obligation, based on its good faith interpretation (and where appropriate based on advice from legal counsel) of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement will not be considered a wilful breach);
(ii) the Portfolio Manager breaches in any respect any material provision of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (other than as specified in paragraph (i) above) which breach (i) is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Controlling Class and (ii) if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 calendar days of the Portfolio Manager becoming aware of, or the Portfolio Manager receiving notice from the Issuer or the Trustee of, such breach or, if such breach is not capable of cured within 30 calendar days but is capable of being cured within a longer period, the Portfolio Manager fails to cure such breach within the period in which a reasonably prudent person could cure such breach (but in no event more than 60 calendar days);
(iii) the Portfolio Manager is wound up or is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger where a successor Portfolio Manager succeeds the Portfolio Manager and is bound by the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents applicable to the Portfolio Manager to the extent expressly contemplated under and subject to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement), or there is appointed over it or all or substantially all of its assets a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer; or the Portfolio Manager: (i) ceases to be able to, or admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as they become due and payable, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of, or seeks or enters into any composition or arrangement with, its creditors generally; (ii) applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee, assignee, custodian, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Portfolio Manager or of any substantial part of its properties or assets, or authorises such an application or consent, or proceedings seeking such
appointment are commenced against the Portfolio Manager without such authorisation, consent or application and either continue undismissed for 60 consecutive days or any such appointment is ordered by a court or regulatory body having jurisdiction;
(iii) authorises or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the application of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, readjustment of debt, insolvency, dissolution, or similar law, or authorises such application or consent, or proceedings to such end are instituted against the Portfolio Manager without such authorisation, application or consent and remain undismissed for 60 consecutive days or result in adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or the issuance of an order for relief or equivalent procedure; or (iv) permits or suffers all or any substantial part of its properties or assets to be sequestered, subject to execution of distress or attached by court order and the order (if contested in good faith) remains undismissed for 60 consecutive days;
(iv) the occurrence of a Note Event of Default (for the avoidance of doubt, only following the expiration of any grace period relating thereto) under Condition 10(a)(i) or (ii) (Note Events of Default) that arises directly from a breach of the Portfolio Manager's duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, which breach has not been cured during any applicable grace period;
(v) (A) any action is taken by the Portfolio Manager, or any of its senior executive officers involved in the management of the Collateral Obligations, that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the Portfolio Manager's obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (as determined pursuant to a final adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction); or (B) the Portfolio Manager (or any senior executive officer of the Portfolio Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) being found guilty of having committed a criminal offence materially related to the management of investments similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral; unless, in the case of either (A) or (B) above, any relevant senior executive officer of the Portfolio Manager has, within 30 calendar days after such determination (in the case of (A)) or guilty verdict (in the case of (B)), been removed from performing work in fulfilment of the Portfolio Manager's obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement;
(vi) the Portfolio Manager resigning pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement; or
(vii) the occurrence of a Portfolio Manager Tax Event.
Pursuant to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement:
(A) upon the occurrence of a Portfolio Manager Event of Default (other than pursuant to paragraph (vi) of the definition thereof), the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement may be terminated, and the Portfolio Manager may be removed upon 30 Business Days' prior written notice to the Portfolio Manager, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator
(i) at the Issuer's discretion; (ii) at the direction of the holders of the Controlling Class acting by PM Removal Resolution; or (iii) by holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by a PM Removal Resolution (in the case of (ii) or (iii), excluding any PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, PM Non-Voting Notes and Notes held by the Portfolio Manager or a Portfolio Manager Related Person); and
(B) upon the occurrence of a removal or resignation of the Portfolio Manager following a Portfolio Manager Event of Default, the Controlling Class, each Class of Rated Notes and the Subordinated Noteholders will have certain rights with respect to the appointment of a successor Portfolio Manager, as more fully described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Issuer acknowledges that the rights of the holders of Rated Notes to participate in the selection or removal of the Portfolio Manager following a Portfolio Manager Event of Default, as described above, are the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default.
11. Enforcement
(a) Security Becoming Enforceable
Subject as provided in paragraph (b) below, the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral shall become enforceable upon an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(b) Enforcement
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion (but subject always to Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition)), and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, as provided in Condition 11(b)(ii) (Enforcement)), institute such proceedings or take such other action against the Issuer or take any other action as it may think fit to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes and, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes, realise and/or otherwise liquidate or sell the Collateral in whole or in part and/or take such other action as may be permitted under applicable laws against any Obligor in respect of the Collateral and/or take any other action to enforce or realise the security over the Collateral in accordance with the Trust Deed (such actions together, "Enforcement Actions"), in each case without any liability as to the consequences of such action and without having regard (save to the extent provided in Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)) to the effect of such action on the individual Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party provided however that:
(i) no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless:
(A) subject to being indemnified and/or prefunded and/or secured to its satisfaction, the Trustee (or an Appointee on its behalf) determines subject to consultation by the Trustee or such Appointee with the Portfolio Manager that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting and allowing for any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) other than the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such amount the "Enforcement Threshold" and such determination being an "Enforcement Threshold Determination") and the Controlling Class agrees with such determination by an Extraordinary Resolution (in which case the Enforcement Threshold will be met); or
(B) subject to paragraph (ii) below, if the Enforcement Threshold will not have been met then: (1) in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in sub- paragraph (i), (ii) or (iv) of Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default), the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to such Note Event of Default; or (2) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes (acting independently) directs the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution to take Enforcement Action;
(ii) the Trustee shall not be bound to institute any Enforcement Action or take any other action unless, subject to the above, it is directed to do so by the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, each Class of Rated Notes acting by Extraordinary Resolution and in each case the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction. Following redemption and payment in full of the Rated Notes, the Trustee shall (provided it is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), act upon the directions of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Extraordinary Resolution; and
(iii) for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Portfolio, the anticipated proceeds to be realised from any Enforcement Action and whether the Enforcement Threshold will be met, the Trustee may appoint an independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor to advise it and may obtain and rely on an opinion and/or advice of such independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor (the cost of which shall be payable as Trustee Fees and Expenses, unless otherwise received in full and not repaid by the Trustee following such indemnification and/or prefunding and/or security as described above) and shall be exempted from any liability arising directly or indirectly from any action taken or not taken by the Trustee in connection with such opinion and/or advice.
The Trustee shall notify the Noteholders, the Issuer, the Agents, the Portfolio Manager, each Hedge Counterparty and the Rating Agencies in the event that it makes an Enforcement Threshold Determination at any time or takes any Enforcement Action at any time (such notice an "Enforcement Notice"). Following the effectiveness of an Acceleration Notice which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) or, as the case may be, following automatic acceleration of the Notes or pursuant to an Optional Redemption in whole in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds, Principal Proceeds and the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral or amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Account which represent Hedge Issuer Tax Credit Payments which are required to be paid or returned to a Hedge Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payment in accordance with the Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) or amounts standing to the credit of the Currency Account which represent Sale Proceeds, repayments or prepayments in respect of Non-Euro Obligations sold subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Currency Hedge Transaction which shall be paid to the relevant Hedge Counterparty in accordance with the terms thereof outside the Priorities of Payment), shall be credited to the Payment Account and shall be distributed in accordance with the following order of priority but in each case only to the extent that all payments of a higher priority have been made in full (the "Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments"):
(A) to the payment of taxes owing by the Issuer accrued (other than any Irish corporate income tax in relation to the Issuer Profit Amount referred to below), as certified by an Authorised Officer of the Issuer to the Trustee, if any, (save for any VAT payable in respect of any Portfolio Management Fee or any other tax payable in relation to any amount payable to the Secured Parties and which arises as a result of the payment of that amount to the relevant Secured Party); and to the payment of the Issuer Profit Amount, for deposit into the Issuer Profit Account from time to time;
(B) to the payment of accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses up to an amount equal to the Senior Expenses Cap in respect of the related Due Period, provided that following an acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) (which has not been rescinded or annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default)), the Senior Expenses Cap shall not apply in respect of such Trustee Fees and Expenses;
(C) to the payment of Administrative Expenses in the priority stated in the definition thereof up to an amount equal to the Senior Expenses Cap in respect of the related Due Period, provided that upon an acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) (which has not been rescinded or annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default)), the Senior Expenses Cap shall not apply in respect of such Administrative Expenses;
(D) to the payment:
(1) firstly, on a pro rata basis to the Portfolio Manager of the Senior Management Fee due and payable on such Payment Date and any VAT in respect thereof (whether payable to the Portfolio Manager or directly to the relevant taxing authority) save for any Deferred Senior Portfolio Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Portfolio Management Amounts which shall not be paid pursuant to this paragraph; and

(3) thirdly, to the Portfolio Manager in payment of any Deferred Senior Portfolio Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Portfolio Management Amounts; and
(4) fourthly, to the repayment of any Portfolio Manager Advances and any interest thereon;

(T) to the payment of Administrative Expenses not paid by reason of the Senior Expenses Cap (if any), in relation to each item thereof in the order of priority stated in the definition thereof;
(U) to the payment on a pari passu and pro rata basis of any Defaulted Currency Hedge Termination Payments due to any Currency Hedge Counterparty or any Defaulted Interest Rate Hedge Termination Payments due to any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty (in each case to the extent not paid out of the Hedge Termination Account or any relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account);
(V) to any Reinvesting Noteholder (whether or not any applicable Reinvesting Noteholder continues on the date of such payment to hold all or any portion of such Subordinated Notes) of any Reinvestment Amounts accrued and not previously paid pursuant to this paragraph (V) with respect to their respective Subordinated Notes, pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Reinvestment Amounts with respect to the Subordinated Notes;
(W) subject to the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold having been reached (after taking into account all prior distributions to Subordinated Noteholders and any distributions to be made to Subordinated Noteholders on such Payment Date, including pursuant to paragraph (X) below, paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments and paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments):
(1) firstly, to the payment to the Portfolio Manager of 20 per cent. of any remaining proceeds in payment of any accrued but unpaid Incentive Portfolio Management Fee; and
(2) secondly, to the payment of any VAT in respect of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee referred to in (a) above (whether payable to the Portfolio Manager or directly to the relevant taxing authority); and
(X) any remaining proceeds to the payment of principal on the Subordinated Notes on a pro rata basis and thereafter to the payment of interest on a pro rata basis on the Subordinated Notes (in each case determined upon redemption in full thereof by reference to the proportion that the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes held by Subordinated Noteholders bore to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to such redemption).
Where the payment of any amount in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out above is subject to any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax, or any other tax is payable by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of any such amount, payment of the amount so deducted or withheld or of the other tax so payable shall be made to the relevant taxing authority pari passu with and, so far as possible, at the same time as the payment of the amount in respect of which the relevant deduction or withholding or other liability to tax has arisen and provided further that when the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments has been applied as a result of the enforcement of the Security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement), payments contemplated in paragraphs (C) and (U) will only be made to such parties which are also Secured Parties.
(c) Only Trustee to Act
Only the Trustee may pursue the remedies available under the Trust Deed to enforce the rights of the Noteholders or, in respect of the Collateral, of any of the other Secured Parties under the Trust Deed and the Notes and no Noteholder or other Secured Party (other than the Trustee) may proceed directly against the Issuer or any of its assets unless the Trustee, having become bound to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, fails or neglects to do so within a reasonable period after having received notice of such failure and such failure or neglect continues for at least 30 calendar days following receipt of such notice by the Trustee. Any proceeds received by a Noteholder or other Secured Party pursuant to any such proceedings brought by a Noteholder or other Secured Party shall be paid promptly following receipt thereof to the Trustee for application pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed. After realisation of the security which has become enforceable and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, no Noteholder or other Secured Party may take any further steps against the Issuer to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes or the Issuer's obligations to such Secured Party and all claims against the Issuer to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes or the Issuer's obligations to such Secured Party and all claims against the Issuer in respect of such sums unpaid shall be extinguished. In particular, none of the Trustee, any Noteholder or any other Secured Party shall be entitled in respect thereof to petition or take any other step for the winding up of the Issuer except to the extent permitted under the Trust Deed.
(d) Purchase of Collateral by Noteholders or Portfolio Manager
Upon any sale of any part of the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes under Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), whether made under the power of sale under the Trust Deed or by virtue of judicial proceedings, any Noteholder, the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person may (but shall not be obliged to) bid for and purchase the Collateral or any part thereof and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain, possess or dispose of such property in its or their own absolute right without accountability. In addition, any purchaser in any such sale which is a Noteholder may deliver Notes held by it in place of payment of the purchase price for such Collateral where the amount payable to such Noteholder in respect of such Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, had the purchase price been paid in cash, is equal to or exceeds such purchase price.
12. Prescription
Claims in respect of principal and interest payable on redemption in full of the relevant Notes while the Notes are represented by a Definitive Certificate will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required by Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) within a period of five years, in the case of
interest, and ten years, in the case of principal, from the date on which payment in respect of such Notes is received by the Principal Paying Agent.
Notwithstanding the above, claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate will become void unless presented for payment within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the date on which any payment first becomes due.
13. Replacement of Notes
If any Note is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of the Transfer Agent, subject in each case to all applicable laws and Euronext Dublin requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer or the Transfer Agent may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.
14. Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution
(a) Provisions in Trust Deed
The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders (and for passing Written Resolutions) to consider matters affecting the interests of the Noteholders including, without limitation, modifying or waiving certain of the provisions of these Conditions and the substitution of the Issuer in certain circumstances.

(b) Decisions and Meetings of Noteholders
(i) General
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution, PM Removal Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together (subject as provided in paragraph (ix) below) or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document or these Conditions, by a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Save to the extent expressly stated otherwise, separate meetings of the Noteholders of each Class shall be convened and held. Ordinary Resolutions, PM Removal Resolutions and Extraordinary Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing, in each case, in at least the minimum percentages specified in the table "Minimum Percentage Voting Requirements" in paragraph (iv) (Minimum Voting Rights) below. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods. Where decisions are to be taken by a Written Resolution of a Class or Classes under the Trust Deed or these Conditions, such decision may only be made in accordance with Condition 14(b)(v) (Written Resolutions) below.
The holder of each Global Certificate will be treated as being one person for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each €1,000 of principal amount of Notes for which the relevant Global Certificate may be exchanged.
Notice of any Resolution passed by the Noteholders will be given by the Issuer to S&P and Fitch in writing.
Notwithstanding that the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes are separate Classes, they shall be treated as a single Class for the purposes of any consent, direction, objection, approval, vote or determination of quorum under the Trust Deed, except as expressly provided in the Trust Deed, with each holder of Class B-1 Notes and Class
B-2 Notes voting based on the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Class B Notes held by such holder (other than in relation to a Refinancing or for the purposes of Extraordinary Resolutions, in which case each of the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall constitute separate Classes).
(ii) Quorum
The quorum required for any meeting convened to consider an Ordinary Resolution, a PM Removal Resolution or an Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, of all the Noteholders or of any Class or Classes of Noteholders, or at any adjourned meeting to consider such a Resolution, shall be as set out in the relevant column and row corresponding to the type of resolution in the table "Quorum Requirements" below.

(xxvi) subject to Rating Agency Confirmation (other than to the extent otherwise permitted pursuant to Condition 14(c)(xxii) (Modification and Waiver) above), to amend, modify

(xxvii) to make any modification or amendment determined by the Issuer, as advised by the Portfolio Manager, (in consultation with legal counsel experienced in such matters) as necessary or advisable for any Class of Rated Notes to not be considered an "ownership interest" as defined for purposes of section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, provided that such modification or amendment would not, in the opinion of the Issuer, be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class;

(A) change the reference rate (including any modifier thereto) in respect of the Floating Rate Notes from EURIBOR to an Alternative Base Rate or a base rate other than an Alternative Base Rate (together with a Reference Rate Modifier and any other changes required in connection with the selection of such base rate);

(D) in the case of a Hedge Agreement, amend, in accordance with its terms the reference rate applicable to any Hedge Transaction thereunder and make any other consequential changes permitted by such agreement (including, without limitation, to allow for the operation of any fallbacks contained in such Hedge Agreement relating to the discontinuance, cessation, disruption or change in methodology of such rate and, accordingly, make any adjustment payment or spread adjustment); or
(E) to make such other amendments as are necessary or advisable in the reasonable judgment of the Portfolio Manager to facilitate the foregoing changes,
provided that:
(1) such amendments, modifications, waivers or authorisations are being undertaken due to the occurrence of one of the following, determined by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion (save in the case of any amendment, modification, waiver or authorisation made under (D) above which shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement):
(aa) a material disruption to LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark;
(bb) a change in the methodology of calculating LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark;
(cc) LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark ceasing to exist;
(dd) an event occurring in respect of the relevant index or benchmark as a result of which the parties will no longer be permitted under any applicable law or regulation to use such index or benchmark to perform an obligation under the relevant Transaction Document (or the reasonable expectation of the Portfolio Manager (or any Hedge Counterparty for amendments in respect of sub-paragraph
(D) above only) that any of the events specified in paragraphs (aa), (bb), (cc) above or this paragraph (dd) will occur); or
(ee) at least 50.0 per cent. (by par amount) of (x) the quarterly pay Floating Rate Collateral Obligations issued in the preceding one month relying on reference or base rates other than LIBOR or EURIBOR, (y) the quarterly paying Floating Rate Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio rely on reference or base rates other than LIBOR or EURIBOR, or
(z) floating rate notes issued in the preceding three months in the Euro-denominated CLO transactions rely on a reference rate other than EURIBOR,
(each event in (aa) to (ee) (inclusive) above, a "Base Rate Event");
(2) any such amendment, modification, authorisation or waiver does not affect the applicability of any floor in respect of the relevant reference rate in respect of any Class of Notes (including, without limitation, the zero floor described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest));
(3) the Noteholders are notified of any such amendment, modification, authorisation or waiver (other than in respect of any amendment, modification, waiver or authorisation made under (D) above to a Hedge Agreement) at least 30 days prior to a Payment Date, as determined by the Portfolio Manager, from which an Alternative Base Rate or a base rate other than an Alternative Base Rate shall apply;
(4) with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver or authorisation (other than in respect of any amendment, modification, waiver or authorisation made under (D) above in respect of any Hedge Agreement) made to effect a change to a base rate other than an Alternative Base Rate, the consent of the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders (in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) is obtained, provided that if the Issuer requests such consent from the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders, any Noteholder of each such Class who does not object to such request within 15 Business Days shall be deemed to have consented to the change to a base rate other than an Alternative Base Rate (together with a Reference Rate Modifier and any other changes required in connection with such selection of such base rate); and
(5) in making any determinations or proposal, or exercising discretion pursuant to this Condition 14(c)(xxviii) (Modification and Wavier), the Portfolio Manager's judgement shall not be called into question, including as a result of subsequent events, and no liability shall attach to the Portfolio Manager in connection therewith unless its actions constitute a Portfolio Manager Breach; and
(xxix) to make any other modification of any of the provisions of any Transaction Document to facilitate compliance by the Issuer with the FTT or any other financial transaction tax that it is or may become subject to.
Any such modification, authorisation or waiver shall be binding upon the Noteholders and shall be notified by the Issuer as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of any supplemental trust deed or any other modification, authorisation or waiver pursuant to this Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) to:
(A) each Rating Agency, so long as any of the Rated Notes remain Outstanding; and
(B) the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and in the Trust Deed, the Issuer shall not agree to amend, modify or supplement any provisions of the Transaction Documents if, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer, such change shall have a material adverse effect on the rights or obligations of a Hedge Counterparty without the Hedge Counterparty's prior written consent or on the Portfolio Manager without the Portfolio Manager's written consent.
To the extent required pursuant to a Hedge Agreement, the Issuer shall notify each Hedge Counterparty of any proposed amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents and seek the prior consent of such Hedge Counterparty in respect thereof, in each case to the extent required in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such notice shall only be given and such consent shall only be sought to the extent required above or in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. If a Hedge Agreement allows a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request, during such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer shall not make any such proposed amendment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders (other than as otherwise provided in paragraphs (xii), (xiv)and (xxviii) above) or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer in making any modification, amendment, waiver or authorisation which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely on absolutely and without enquiry or liability) is required pursuant to the paragraphs above (other than a modification, waiver or authorisation pursuant to paragraphs
(xiii) or (xv) above in which the Trustee may, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer) to the Transaction Documents, provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged to agree to any modification or any other matter which, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the rights, powers, authorisations, discretions, indemnities or protections, of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents.
In the case of a request for consent to a modification, amendment, waiver or authorisation pursuant to paragraphs (xiii) or (xv) above, under no circumstances shall the Trustee be required to give such consent on less than 21 days' prior written notice and the Trustee shall be entitled to obtain legal, financial or other expert advice, at the expense of the Issuer, and rely on such advice in connection with determining whether or not to give such consent (if applicable or required) as it sees fit.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market, any material amendments or modifications to these Conditions, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to this Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to Euronext Dublin.
(d) Substitution
The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee to agree, subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed and such other conditions as the Trustee may require (without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class), to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes
of each Class, if required for taxation purposes, provided that such substitution would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, but subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to receipt of such information and/or opinions as the Rating Agency may require), to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed, provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. Any substitution agreed by the Trustee pursuant to this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) shall be binding on the Noteholders, and shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may direct. The Trustee will not approve any such substitution or change in the place of residence of the Issuer under this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) unless the Trustee has received written advice from legal counsel or a recognised tax expert (such advice to be paid for by the Issuer) to the effect that such substitution or change in the place of residence of the Issuer will not (1) result in the Issuer becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to its net income, (2) result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (3) have a material adverse effect on the tax treatment of the Issuer.
(e) Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest
In connection with the exercise of its trusts, powers, duties and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)), the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of each Class of Noteholders as a Class and shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise for individual Noteholders of such Class and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 9 (Taxation).
In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificates are held on behalf of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to each Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of any Global Certificate.
The Trust Deed provides that where (in the opinion of the Trustee) there is a conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of, (i) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (ii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iii) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iv) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders and (v) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by Principal Amount Outstanding of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that, except as expressly provided otherwise in any applicable Transaction Document or these Conditions, the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class where the holders of the Class or Classes having priority over such other Class do not have an interest in the subject
matter of such directions) (in each case acting by Extraordinary Resolution) subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes.
In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall, as regards all the powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions vested in it by the Trust Deed, have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person and no Secured Party shall have any claim against the Trustee for so doing.
15. Indemnification of the Trustee
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving it from instituting proceedings to enforce repayment or to enforce the security constituted by or pursuant to the Trust Deed, unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document and any entity related to the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document without accounting for any profit. The Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure, or to monitor the provisions of any insurance arrangements in respect of, the Collateral (for the avoidance of doubt, under the Trust Deed the Trustee is under no such obligation) and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held by the Custodian or is otherwise held in safe custody by a bank or other custodian. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the performance by the Custodian of any of its duties under the Agency and Account Bank Agreement or for the performance by the Portfolio Manager of any of its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, for the performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or for the performance by any other person appointed by the Issuer in relation to the Notes or by any other party to any Transaction Document. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for the administration, management or operation of the Collateral including the request by the Portfolio Manager to release any of the Collateral from time to time. The Trustee is entitled to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without further enquiry. The Trustee shall accept, without investigation, requisition or objection to, such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement of the Trustee and the removal of the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, but no such retirement or removal shall become effective until a successor trustee is appointed.
16. Notices
Notices to Noteholders will be valid if posted to the address of such Noteholder appearing in the Register at the time of publication of such notice by pre-paid, first class mail (or any other manner approved by the Trustee which may be by electronic transmission) and (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require) shall be sent to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders (a) in the case of inland mail three days after the date of dispatch thereof, (b) in the case of overseas mail, seven days after the dispatch thereof or, (c) in the case of electronic transmission, on the date of dispatch.
Notices will be valid and will be deemed to have been given, for so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin, when such notice is filed in the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require.
The Trustee may notify holders by such other method if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the rules of the stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Noteholders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.
Notwithstanding the above, so long as any Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for delivery thereof as required by the Conditions of such Notes provided that such notice is also made to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin for so long as such Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require. Such notice will be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the date of delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system.
17. Additional Issuances
(a) The Issuer may, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, subject to the approval of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution and the prior written approval of the Originator and, in respect of additional issuances of Class A Notes only, the approval of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution, create and issue further notes having the same terms and conditions as existing Classes of Notes (subject as provided below) and which shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Outstanding Notes of such Class (unless otherwise provided), and will use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer's issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations, provided that the following conditions are met:
(i) such additional issuances in relation to the applicable Class of Notes may not exceed
100.0 per cent. in the aggregate of the original aggregate principal amount as at the Issue Date of such Class of Notes;
(ii) such additional notes must be issued for a cash sale price and the net proceeds invested in Collateral Obligations or, pending such investment, during the Initial Investment Period deposited in the Unused Proceeds Account or, thereafter, deposited in the Principal Account and, in each case, invested in Eligible Investments;
(iii) such additional notes must be of each Class of Notes and issued in a proportionate amount among the Classes so that the relative proportions of aggregate principal amount of the Classes of Notes existing immediately prior to such additional issuance remain unchanged immediately following such additional issuance (save with respect to Subordinated Notes as described in paragraph (b) below);
(iv) the terms (other than the date of issuance, the issue price and the date from which interest will accrue) of such notes must be identical to the terms of the previously issued Notes of the applicable Class of Notes;

18. Third Party Rights
No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
19. Governing Law
(a) Governing Law
The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Issuer Corporate Services Agreement and the Share Charge are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland.
(b) Jurisdiction
The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non-contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes ("Proceedings") may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process
The Issuer appoints TMF Global Services (UK) Limited (having an office, at the date hereof, at 20 Farringdon Street, 8th Floor, London EC4A 4AB) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer does not have such agent in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) are expected to be approximately €249,080,000. Such proceeds will be used by the Issuer for the repayment of any amounts borrowed by the Issuer (together with any interest thereon) and all other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date and to fund the First Period Reserve Account on the Issue Date. The remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the Unused Proceeds Account.
FORM OF THE NOTES
The following description of the form of the Notes consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Global Certificates which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such document.

References below to Notes and to the Global Certificates and the Definitive Certificates representing such Notes are to each respective Class of Notes, except as otherwise indicated.
Initial Issue of Notes
The Regulation S Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, as described below) will be represented on issue by one or more Regulation S Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest, coupons or principal receipts, deposited with, and registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held at any time only through and transfers thereof will only be effected through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See "Book Entry Clearance Procedures". Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may not be held by a U.S. Person or U.S. Resident at any time. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. Person, and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest only to a person (a) whom the seller reasonably believes to be a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, or (b) to be a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate (or, in the case of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes and if applicable, a Rule 144A Definitive Certificate). See "Transfer Restrictions".
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, as described below) will be represented on issue by a Rule 144A Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest, coupons or principal receipts, deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may only be held at any time through and transfers thereof will only be effected through, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See "Book Entry Clearance Procedures". By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is a QIB/QP and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. See "Transfer Restrictions".
Beneficial interests in Global Certificates will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and as set forth in Rule 144A and Regulation S, and the Notes will bear the applicable legends regarding the restrictions set forth under "Transfer Restrictions". In the case of each Class of Notes, a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate in denominations greater than or equal to the minimum denominations applicable to interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) to the effect that the transferor reasonably believes that the transferee is a QIB/QP and that such transaction is in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificates may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) from the transferor to the effect that the transfer is being made in an offshore transaction to a non-U.S. Person and in accordance with Regulation S.
Any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate and become an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate for as long as it remains such an interest. Any beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate and become an interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate for so long as it remains such an interest. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the
Transfer Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
Each initial investor and each transferee of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes shall be required or deemed to represent, warrant and agree (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, (and for so long as it holds such Note or an interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, an investor that is or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person may acquire such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or any interest therein) if such transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and (iii) either (A) acquires such interest in the form of a Definitive Certificate, or (B) is a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person that purchases the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes on the Issue Date or is the Originator, and acquires such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate.
No proposed purchase or transfer of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein), in any form, will be permitted or recognised if a purchase or transfer to a transferee will cause 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors, disregarding Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein) held by Controlling Persons, as determined under ERISA and applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulations. See "Certain ERISA Considerations". Any Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate shall be registered in the name of the holder thereof.
The Notes are not issuable in bearer form. Exchange for Definitive Certificates Exchange
Each Global Certificate will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Definitive Exchange Date (as defined below), in whole but not in part, for Definitive Certificates if a Global Certificate is held (directly or indirectly) on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or an alternative clearing system and any such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces its intention to permanently cease business or does in fact do so.
In addition, interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes may be exchangeable for interests in a Definitive Certificate representing the Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note if a transferee is or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person provided: (i) such transferee has obtained the written consent of the Issuer in respect of such transfer; and (ii) the transferee has provided the Issuer with a certification substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate).
Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes may be exchangeable for interests in Definitive Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Conditions.
The Registrar will not register the transfer of, or exchange of interests in, a Global Certificate for Definitive Certificates during the period from (but excluding) the Record Date to (and including) the date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.
If only one of the Global Certificates (the "Exchanged Global Certificate") becomes exchangeable for Definitive Certificates in accordance with the above paragraphs, transfers of Notes may not take place between, on the one hand, persons holding Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Exchanged Global Certificate and, on the other hand, persons wishing to purchase beneficial interests in the other Global Certificate.
"Definitive Exchange Date" means a day falling not less than 30 calendar days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar and the Transfer Agent is located.
Delivery

In the event a Global Certificate is to be exchanged, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Definitive Certificates and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under "Transfer Restrictions".
Legends

The holder of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note may transfer the Notes represented thereby in whole or in part in the applicable Minimum Denomination by surrendering such Note(s) at the specified office of the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, together with the completed form of transfer and, to the extent applicable, written consent of the Issuer and a duly completed ERISA Certificate substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate). Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note bearing the legend referred to under "Transfer Restrictions" below, or upon specific request for removal of the legend on a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, the Issuer will deliver only Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. With the written consent of the Issuer, a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate, subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate (as applicable).

RATINGS OF THE NOTES

General

It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Notes (except for the Subordinated Notes) be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes: "AAA (sf)" from S&P and "AAAsf" from Fitch; the Class B- 1 Notes: "AA (sf)" from S&P and "AAsf" from Fitch; the Class B-2 Notes: "AA (sf)" from S&P and "AAsf" from Fitch; the Class C Notes: "A (sf)" from S&P and "Asf" from Fitch; the Class D Notes: "BBB (sf)" from S&P and "BBB-sf" from Fitch; the Class E Notes: "BB- (sf)" from S&P and "BB-sf" from Fitch; the Class F Notes: "B- (sf)" from S&P and "B-sf" from Fitch. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.
The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes, the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the other Rated Notes address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.
S&P Ratings

S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and
(c) legal considerations.
Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied from the period beginning as of the Effective Date and ending on the expiry of the Reinvestment Period.
S&P's analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the "S&P CDO Monitor") which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Portfolio Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P's proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.
Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the "Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model") is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.
There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, or the Originator, makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.
S&P's Ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its
analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.
Fitch Ratings
The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Fitch are based upon Fitch's statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with similar characteristics to the Collateral Obligations and the various eligibility requirements that the Collateral Obligations are required to satisfy.
Fitch analyses the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default, based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Fitch then determines the level of credit protection necessary based on a specific percentile of the portfolio default distribution determined by the Fitch "Portfolio Credit Model" which takes into account the correlation between assets in the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. The results of a statistical analysis are incorporated into a cash flow model built to mimic the structure of the transaction. In this regard, the results of several default scenarios, in conjunction with various qualitative tests (e.g. analysis of the strength of the Portfolio Manager), are used to determine the credit enhancement required to support a particular rating.
Fitch's ratings of the Rated Notes were established under various assumptions and scenarios.
There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by Fitch in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and consequently loss rates) will not defer from those assumed by Fitch.
In addition to those quantitative tests, Fitch ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Portfolio Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Fitch deems relevant.

THE PORTFOLIO
The following description of the Portfolio consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

Introduction
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Portfolio Manager.
Acquisition of Collateral Obligations
The Portfolio Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter (including, but not limited to, Collateral Obligations purchased pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements). The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it, or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf, will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least €225,000,000 which is 90 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. The proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (including amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations); and
(b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes, will be deposited in the Expense Reserve Account, the First Period Reserve Account and the Unused Proceeds Account on the Issue Date. The Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance, the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Fitch Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account during the Initial Investment Period.
The Issuer may not acquire (whether during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period or thereafter) or dispose of any Collateral Obligation (during the Reinvestment Period) unless either (i) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such acquisition or disposal, or (ii) in connection with an acquisition following which the Originator Requirement would not be met, such Collateral Obligation is acquired from the Originator, in each case unless and to the extent the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply.
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Portfolio Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 24 December 2020, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
On or after the Effective Date but prior to the first Payment Date no more than 1.0 per cent. of the Reinvestment Target Par Balance may be transferred to the Interest Account in one or more instalments, in aggregate and without duplication, from the Unused Proceeds Account and/or the Principal Account at the discretion of the Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, provided that (i) (after giving effect to the transfer of such amount to the Interest Account) the Class E Par Value Test is satisfied, (ii) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests is satisfied and (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transfer, the Collateral Principal Amount (calculated for this purpose on the basis that the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation is the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Fitch Collateral Value) equals or exceeds the Reinvestment Target Par Balance. Within 10 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the "Effective Date Report") containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager and the Rating Agencies; provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, (a) any repayments or prepayments in respect of a Collateral
Obligation following acquisition by the Issuer shall be disregarded and (b) the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of (i) its S&P Collateral Value and (ii) its Fitch Collateral Value and provided further that, for so long as any of the Rated Notes are rated by Fitch and are Outstanding, such requirements shall only be deemed satisfied if they would also be satisfied if paragraph (a) above were to read "the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (only in respect of such amounts that are not designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account) shall be included in the determination of the Aggregate Principal Balance (provided that, for the purposes of determining such Balances, Principal Proceeds to be used to purchase Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to purchase, but in respect of which has not yet settled, shall be excluded as if such purchase had been completed and principal proceeds to be received from the sale of Collateral Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell, but in respect of which sale has not yet settled, shall be included as if such sale has been completed)" and within 15 Business Days following the Effective Date the Issuer will provide, or cause the Portfolio Manager to provide, to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (with a copy to the Portfolio Manager, if applicable), confirmation of receipt of an accountants' certificate recalculating and comparing the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at the Effective Date and the results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests) by reference to such Collateral Obligations. The accountants' certificate shall specify the procedures undertaken to review data and re- computations relating to such recalculations.
The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that if the Effective Date S&P Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been given by S&P. If the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Portfolio Manager shall promptly notify S&P. If
(i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to S&P, or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan upon request therefor by the Portfolio Manager; or (ii) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied and, following a request therefor from the Portfolio Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P not having been received; an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Portfolio Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
In addition, if the Effective Date S&P Condition has not yet occurred on the Effective Date and (w) the Issuer provides S&P with the excel default model input file (as used by S&P), (x) the Issuer causes the Portfolio Manager to provide to S&P the Effective Date Report and the Effective Date Report confirms satisfaction of the S&P CDO Monitor Test as of the Effective Date, (y) the Portfolio Manager certifies to S&P (which confirmation may be in the form of an email) that the S&P CDO Monitor Test has been run as of the last day prior to the Effective Date (taking into account the S&P CDO Monitor Non-Model Adjustments described below) and that the result is passing and (z) the Portfolio Manager provides to S&P an electronic copy of the Portfolio used to generate the passing test result, then a written confirmation from S&P of its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes shall be deemed to have been provided; provided that, for purposes of determining compliance with the S&P CDO Monitor Test in connection with such Effective Date Report (A) the Aggregate Funded Spread shall be calculated without giving effect to the paragraph immediately beneath the proviso of the definition of "Aggregate Funded Spread" detailing the consequences of a EURIBOR floor and assuming that any Collateral Obligation subject to a EURIBOR floor bears interest at a rate equal to the stated interest rate spread for such Collateral Obligation and (B) for the purposes of the S&P CDO Adjusted BDR, without including in the Aggregate Principal Balance any Principal Proceeds designated to be included as Interest Proceeds on the Effective Date (the foregoing subclauses (A) and (B), together, the "S&P CDO Monitor Non-Model Adjustments").
The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings
of the Rated Notes, provided that if the Effective Date Non-Model CDO Monitor Test is satisfied such rating confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from S&P.
If (a)(i) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied as at the Effective Date and Rating Agency Confirmation of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes has not been received; and (ii) either (A) the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies; or (B) Rating Agency Confirmation has not been obtained for the Rating Confirmation Plan that the Portfolio Manager provides or (b) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied and, following a request therefor from the Portfolio Manager after the Effective Date, Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P has not been obtained, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event, notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and/or (b) above applying.
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations and/or any other intended action which is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.
The Portfolio Manager has internal policies and procedures in relation to the granting of credit (in respect of the Collateral Obligations), which include criteria for the granting of credit and the process for approving, amending and refinancing credits (as to which, in relation to the Collateral Obligations, see also the information set out in this section of this Offering Circular, which describes the criteria that the selection of Collateral Obligations are subject to, being, in particular, in the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Reinvestment Criteria). The Portfolio Manager is obliged to exercise such policies and procedures subject to the Standard of Care required under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, and as further described in this Offering Circular.

(ii) Collateral Obligations which are the subject of a restructuring (whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor) which must satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria on the applicable Restructuring Date, the subsequent failure of any Collateral Obligation to satisfy any of the Eligibility Criteria shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Obligation from being a Collateral Obligation so long as such obligation satisfied the Eligibility Criteria, when the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer entered into a binding agreement to purchase such obligation.
For the avoidance of doubt, a security that is a Step-Up Coupon Security and that otherwise meets the Eligibility Criteria shall be eligible.
"Domicile" or "Domiciled" means with respect to any Obligor with respect to a Collateral Obligation:
(a) except as provided in clause (b) below, its country of organisation or incorporation; or
(b) the jurisdiction and the country in which, in the Portfolio Manager's reasonable judgement, a substantial portion of such Obligor's operations are located or from which a substantial portion of its revenue is derived, in each case directly or through subsidiaries (which shall be any jurisdiction and country known at the time of designation by the Portfolio Manager to be the source of the majority of revenues, if any, of such Obligor).
"Eligible Interest Rate Obligation" means:
(a) it is a debt obligation that either pays a fixed amount of interest or a floating amount of interest referenced to a published reference rate commonly used in the financial markets (for the purposes of determining satisfaction of this requirement, having regard to the primary method to determine such floating rate and not taking in to account any fall-back mechanism) based on one of the following periods:
(a) 1-month;
(b) 3 months;
(c) 6 months; or
(d) 12 months;
(b) it is not a debt obligation that allows the Obligor to pay interest amounts in a currency that is different from the denomination of the principal amount of such debt obligation;
(c) it is not a debt obligation in respect of which the interest coupon or margin may increase due to a decrease of the index or reference rate applicable to the determination of such interest amount or decrease due to an increase of the index or reference rate applicable to the determination of such interest amount;
(d) it is not a debt obligation in respect of which the index or reference rate applicable to the determination of the interest amount is based on a derivative of any index or reference rate;
(e) it is not a debt obligation in respect of which the tenor of the index or reference rate applicable to the determination of the interest amount is different to the tenor of the frequency of interest amount payments required to be made by the Obligor, other than in respect of the initial interest period or the final interest period prior to maturity or an acceleration or other early termination of such debt obligation (or both as the case may be), provided that in each case the difference of the tenor of the index or reference rate to the tenor of the frequency of interest amount payments required to be made by the Obligor is not more than one month at any time; and
(f) it is a debt obligation in respect of which any interest amount that is deferred (including any interest amount that is automatically deferred or deferred at the option of the Obligor, and including any interest
amount that is capitalised) incurs interest that is the same as the rate that is applicable to the principal amount of such debt obligation.
"Portfolio Company" means any Person that is controlled (which, for such purposes, means having the power, direct or indirect, (A) to vote more than 30 per cent. of the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of directors of such Person, or (B) to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person whether by contract or otherwise) by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation, or their respective Affiliates, or an account, fund, client or portfolio established and controlled by the Portfolio Manager, Onex Corporation or their respective Affiliates.
"Project Finance Loan" means a loan obligation under which the obligor is obliged to make payments that depend (except for rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of payments) on revenues arising from infrastructure assets, including, without limitation:
(a) the sale of products, such as electricity, water, gas or oil, generated by one or more infrastructure assets in the utility industry by a special purpose entity; and
(b) fees charged in respect of one or more highways, bridges, tunnels, pipelines or other infrastructure assets by a special purpose entity, and
in each case, the sole activity of such special purpose entity is the ownership and/or management of such asset or assets and the acquisition and/or development of such asset by the special purpose entity was effected primarily with the proceeds of debt financing made available to it on a limited recourse basis.
"Qualifying Currency" means Sterling, U.S. Dollars, Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, Swedish Krona, Swiss Francs, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Japanese Yen, or such other currency in respect of which Rating Agency Confirmation is received.
"Step-Down Coupon Security" means a security, the contractual interest rate of which decreases over a specified period of time. For the avoidance of doubt, a security will not be considered to be a Step-Down Coupon Security where interest payments decrease for non-contractual reasons due to unscheduled events such as a decrease in the index relating to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, the change from a default rate of interest to a non-default rate, or an improvement in the Obligor's financial condition.
"Step-Up Coupon Security" means a security the interest rate of which increases over a specified period of time other than due to the increase of the floating rate index applicable to such security.
"Structured Finance Security" means any debt security which is secured directly, or represents the ownership of, a pool of consumer receivables, auto loans, auto leases, equipment leases, home or commercial mortgages, corporate debt or sovereign debt obligations or similar assets, including, without limitation, collateralised bond obligations, collateralised loan obligations or any similar security.
"Synthetic Security" means a security or swap transaction (other than a Participation) that has payments of interest or principal on a reference obligation or the credit performance of a reference obligation.
"Zero Coupon Security" means a security (other than a Step-Up Coupon Security) that, at the time of determination, does not provide for periodic payments of interest.
Restructured Obligations
If a Collateral Obligation becomes (in the sole discretion of the Portfolio Manager) the subject of a restructuring whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation (including but not limited to an amendment of its maturity date) or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor, such obligation shall only constitute a Restructured Obligation if such obligation satisfies each of the criteria comprising the Eligibility Criteria other than the criteria set out at paragraphs (c), (i), (j), (q), (r), (u) (provided that the redemption price of such Collateral Obligation is expected to be 100 per cent. of the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation), (dd) and (jj); provided that: (a) such obligation has been assigned or otherwise has a Fitch Rating and an S&P Rating; (b) such obligation is not a pre-funded letter of credit and (c) in the case of an obligation which, as a result of such restructuring, would have a Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity falling on or after the Maturity Date of the Notes (a "Long-Dated Restructured Obligation"), not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall
be the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Fitch Collateral Value) shall consist of Long-Dated Restructured Obligations (such applicable criteria, the "Restructured Obligation Criteria").
For the avoidance of doubt, the refinancing of a Collateral Obligation which is not a restructuring, in circumstances whereby the redemption proceeds are rolled as consideration for a new obligation (including by way of a "cashless roll"), shall be treated as an acquisition by the Issuer of a new Collateral Obligation.
Management of the Portfolio
Overview

The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is permitted, in certain circumstances and, subject to certain requirements, to sell, at its discretion, Collateral Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities and to reinvest the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Portfolio Manager) thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations. The Portfolio Manager shall notify the Collateral Administrator of all necessary details of the Collateral Obligation or Exchanged Equity Security to be sold and the proposed Substitute Collateral Obligation to be purchased and the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) shall determine and shall provide confirmation of whether the Portfolio Profile Tests and Reinvestment Criteria which are required to be satisfied, maintained or improved in connection with any such sale or reinvestment are satisfied, maintained or improved or, if any such criteria are not satisfied, maintained or improved, shall notify the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager of the reasons and the extent to which such criteria are not so satisfied, maintained or improved.
The Portfolio Manager will determine and use reasonable endeavours to cause to be purchased by the Issuer, Collateral Obligations (including all Substitute Collateral Obligations) taking into account the Eligibility Criteria, the guidelines in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and, where applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria and will monitor the performance of the Collateral Obligations on an ongoing basis to the extent practicable using sources of information reasonably available to it (including measurement and monitoring of the credit risk of the Collateral Obligations)and provided that the Portfolio Manager shall not be responsible for determining whether or not the terms of any individual Collateral Obligation have been observed.
Without prejudice to any other condition to any purchase of a Collateral Obligation in the Transaction Documents, as a condition to any purchase of an additional Collateral Obligation by or on behalf of the Issuer (other than in connection with the acquisition of a Collateral Obligation of an Obligor pursuant to a refinancing of a Collateral Obligation of the same Obligor already held by the Issuer), the Portfolio Manager must reasonably expect that the balance in the Principal Account, as adjusted so as to take into account (i) all expected debits and credits in connection with such purchase and all other sales and purchases (as applicable) previously or simultaneously committed to and (ii) (without duplication of amounts in paragraph (i)) the amount of Principal Proceeds the Portfolio Manager reasonably expects will be received after such purchase, specified in the Report next published after such purchase, will be either (i) greater than zero or (ii) an amount with an absolute value not greater than 2 per cent. of the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount as of the Measurement Date immediately preceding the trade date for such purchase.
The activities referred to below that the Portfolio Manager may undertake on behalf of the Issuer are subject to the Issuer's monitoring of the performance of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
Sale of Issue Date Collateral Obligations

The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell any Issue Date Collateral Obligations which do not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date (each a "Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Obligation").

Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, Defaulted Obligations and Equity Securities

Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations may be sold at any time by the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) if (i) the Originator Requirement will be satisfied immediately after giving effect to such sale, unless such sale is effected following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period; and
(ii) subject to, within the Portfolio Manager's knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
The Portfolio Manager shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to effect the sale of any Equity Securities in the Portfolio, provided that the Portfolio Manager shall not be required to have regard to the price it receives for such Equity Securities in committing to any such sale.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Exchanged Equity Securities

Any Exchanged Equity Security may be sold at any time by the Portfolio Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer), subject to, within the Portfolio Manager's knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
In addition to any discretionary sale of Exchanged Equity Securities as provided above, the Portfolio Manager shall be required by the Issuer to use commercially reasonable endeavours to sell (on behalf of the Issuer) any Exchanged Equity Security which constitutes Margin Stock as soon as practicable upon its receipt or upon its becoming Margin Stock (as applicable) and at all times as permitted by applicable law.
Discretionary Sales

The Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf may dispose of any Collateral Obligation (or any other asset) at any time if it determines that the acquisition or holding of such Collateral Obligation (or other asset) violates or may in the future violate certain tax covenants for the purposes of U.S. taxation as set out in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may dispose of any Collateral Obligation (other than a Credit Improved Obligation, a Credit Risk Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation, an Equity Security or an Exchanged Equity Security, each of which may only be sold in the circumstances provided above) at any time ("Discretionary Sales") provided:
(a) no Note Event of Default has occurred which is continuing (in the case of the Portfolio Manager, to its knowledge, without the need for inquiry or investigation);
(b) no Restricted Trading Period is in effect;
(c) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations sold as described in this paragraph during the preceding 12 calendar months (or, for the first 12 calendar months after the Issue Date, during the period commencing on the Issue Date) is not greater than 30 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount as of the first day of such 12 calendar month period (or as of the Issue Date, as the case may be); and
(d) either:
(i) during the Reinvestment Period, (x) the Portfolio Manager reasonably believes prior to such sale that it will be able to enter into one or more binding commitments to reinvest all or a portion of the proceeds of such sale in one or more additional Collateral Obligations within 45 days after the settlement of such sale in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria and (y) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such disposal; or
(ii) at any time either (1) the Sale Proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligation sold; or (2) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding the Collateral Obligation being sold but including, without duplication, the expected Sale Proceeds of such sale and for such purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its Market Value multiplied by its Principal Balance) plus, without duplication, the amounts on deposit in the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) will be greater than (or equal to) the Reinvestment Target Par Balance.
Restricted Trading Period

Sale of Assets which do not Constitute Collateral Obligations

In the event that an asset did not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the date it was required to do so in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to sell such asset. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
Reinvestment of Collateral Obligations

"Reinvestment Criteria" means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under "During the Reinvestment Period" below and, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under "Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period". The Reinvestment Criteria shall not apply prior to the Effective Date or in the case of a Collateral Obligation which has been restructured where such restructuring has become binding on the holders thereof.
During the Reinvestment Period

During the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, at its discretion, reinvest any Principal Proceeds (with the exception of Principal Proceeds received both before and after the Reinvestment Period in connection with the acceptance of an Offer where such Offer is by way of novation or substitution, where such principal proceeds will be reinvested automatically as consideration for the novated or substitute Collateral Obligation (subject to the Restructured Obligation Criteria being satisfied)) in the purchase of Substitute Collateral Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria provided that immediately after entering into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation and taking into account existing commitments, the criteria set out below must be satisfied:
(a) to the Portfolio Manager's knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(b) such obligation is a Collateral Obligation;
(c) on and after the Effective Date (or in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, the second Payment Date) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if (other than with respect to the reinvestment of any proceeds received upon the sale of, or as a recovery on, any Defaulted Obligation) as calculated immediately prior to any purchase of a Substitute Collateral Obligation any Coverage Test was not satisfied, the coverage ratio relating to such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(d) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Risk Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased with such Sale Proceeds shall at least equal such Sale Proceeds;
(ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its Fitch Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) of all Collateral Obligations (after such sale) will be maintained or increased, when compared to the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) of all Collateral Obligations immediately prior to such sale; or
(iii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its Fitch Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including any Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) is equal to or greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(e) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Improved Obligation or a Discretionary Sale or the reinvestment of Scheduled Principal Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its Fitch Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) immediately prior to the sale that generates such Sale Proceeds or receipt of such Scheduled Principal Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds; or
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by the lower of its Fitch Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value) of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including any Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(f) after the Effective Date, either (A) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be satisfied; or (B) as calculated immediately prior to any purchase of a Substitute Collateral Obligation, if any of the Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests are not satisfied such tests will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the results of such tests immediately prior to the sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation(s);
(g) no Retention Deficiency shall occur as a direct result of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such reinvestment; and
(h) either (i) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment, or
(ii) in connection with a reinvestment following which the Originator Requirement would not be satisfied, such Collateral Obligation is acquired from the Originator, in each case unless and to the extent the Originator Requirement is determined (in accordance with the definition thereof) no longer to apply,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has occurred during the Reinvestment Period but which settle after such date, the purchase of such Collateral Obligations shall be treated as a purchase made during the Reinvestment Period for purposes of the Trust Deed.
Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds of Collateral Obligations (with the exception of principal proceeds received both before and after the Reinvestment Period in connection with the acceptance of an Offer where such Offer is by way of novation or substitution, where such principal proceeds will be reinvested automatically as consideration for the novated or substitute Collateral Obligation (subject to the Restructured Obligation Criteria being satisfied)), only, may be reinvested by the Portfolio Manager (acting on
behalf of the Issuer) in one or more Substitute Collateral Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, in each case provided that:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Obligations equals or exceeds (i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the related Collateral Obligations that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds or (ii) the amount of Sale Proceeds of any such Credit Risk Obligations, as the case may be;
(b) after giving effect to such reinvestment, not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Fitch CCC Obligations;
(c) after giving effect to such reinvestment, not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are S&P CCC Obligations;
(d) immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment, the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be satisfied;
(e) a Restricted Trading Period is not currently in effect;
(f) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests is satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment or if not so satisfied, are maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment;

(h) to the Portfolio Manager's knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(i) the maturity date of any Substitute Collateral Obligation is not later than the maturity date of the Collateral Obligation being sold or in respect of which Unscheduled Principal Proceeds are received;
(j) the Originator Requirement is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(k) no Retention Deficiency shall occur as a direct result of and immediately after giving effect to, such reinvestment;
(l) each Substitute Collateral Obligation has the same or a higher S&P Rating as the Collateral Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds, as the case may be;
(m) if:
(i) the Weighted Average Life Test was satisfied on the last Business Day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test shall be satisfied or at least maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared to the results of such measurement immediately prior to the relevant sale or prepayment (in whole or in part); or
(ii) the Weighted Average Life Test was not satisfied on the last Business Day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test shall be satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment; and
(n) each of the Collateral Quality Tests (other than the Weighted Average Life Test, the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test and the S&P CDO Monitor Test (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is not applicable following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period)) will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the results of such tests immediately prior to the sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation(s).
Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations or Credit Improved Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above by the later of (x) 45 days after receipt of such proceeds and (y) the end of the Due Period in which such proceeds were received, shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments on the following Payment Date (subject as provided at the end of this paragraph), save that the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Risk Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and
designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment but in any case for no longer than the later of (A) 45 calendar days following their receipt by the Issuer and (B) the end of the following Due Period, following which time such Principal Proceeds shall be disbursed on the immediately following Payment Date in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria are not satisfied as of the Payment Date next following receipt of such Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, all such funds shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments set out in Condition 3(c)(ii) (Application of Principal Proceeds) and such funds shall be applied only in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Unsaleable Assets

Notwithstanding the other requirements set forth herein and in the Trust Deed, on any Business Day after the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, may conduct an auction on behalf of the Issuer of Unsaleable Assets in accordance with the procedures described in this paragraph provided that no such auction shall take place unless a redemption of the Notes in full in accordance with the Conditions is contemplated or scheduled to occur within three months of such auction. Promptly after receipt of written notice from the Portfolio Manager of such auction, the Principal Paying Agent will provide notice (in such form as is prepared by the Portfolio Manager) to the Noteholders of an auction, setting forth in reasonable detail a description of each Unsaleable Asset and the following auction procedures: (i) any Noteholder may submit a written bid within 10 Business Days after the date of such notice to purchase one or more Unsaleable Assets no later than the date specified in the auction notice (which will be at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice); (ii) each bid must include an offer to purchase for a specified amount of cash on a proposed settlement date no later than 20 Business Days after the date of the auction notice; (iii) if no Noteholder submits such a bid within the time period specified under paragraph (i) above, unless the Portfolio Manager determines that delivery in kind is not legally or commercially practicable and provides written notice thereof to the Principal Paying Agent, the Principal Paying Agent will provide notice (in a form to be prepared by the Portfolio Manager) thereof to each Noteholder (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) and the Portfolio Manager shall offer to deliver (at such Noteholder's expense) a pro rata portion (as determined by the Portfolio Manager) of each unsold Unsaleable Asset to the Noteholders or beneficial owners of the most senior Class of Notes that provide delivery instructions in writing to the Collateral Administrator on or before the date specified in such notice, subject to minimum denominations; provided that, to the extent that minimum denominations do not permit a pro rata distribution, the Collateral Administrator will distribute the Unsaleable Assets on a pro rata basis to the extent possible and the Portfolio Manager will select by lottery the Noteholder or beneficial owner to whom the remaining amount will be delivered and deliver written notice thereof to the Collateral Administrator; provided, further, that the Collateral Administrator will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect delivery of such interests; and (iv) if no such Noteholder or beneficial owner provides delivery instructions to the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Administrator will promptly notify the Portfolio Manager and offer to deliver (at the cost of the Portfolio Manager) the Unsaleable Asset to the Portfolio Manager. If the Portfolio Manager declines such offer, the Collateral Administrator will take such action as directed by the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in writing to dispose of the Unsaleable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means. For the avoidance of doubt, any sale or delivery or other transfer or disposal of an Unsaleable Asset in the circumstances contemplated in this paragraph shall not affect the Principal Amount Outstanding of any Notes.
"Unsaleable Assets" means (a)(i) a Defaulted Obligation, (ii) an Equity Security or (iii) an obligation received in connection with an Offer, in a restructuring or plan of reorganisation with respect to the obligor, in each case, in respect of which the Issuer has not received a payment in cash during the preceding 12 months or (b) any Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment identified in an officer's certificate of the Portfolio Manager as having a Market Value multiplied by its Principal Balance of less than Euro 1,000, in the case of each of (a) and (b) with respect to which the Portfolio Manager certifies to the Trustee that (x) it has made commercially reasonable endeavours to dispose of such obligation for at least 90 days and (y) in its commercially reasonable judgement such obligation is not expected to be saleable in the foreseeable future.
Amendments to Collateral Obligations

The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on the Issuer's behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment during the Reinvestment Period only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment (a) the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity Date of the Rated Notes; (b) the Weighted Average Life Test is satisfied and (c) the Aggregate Principal
Balance of all Collateral Obligations that have been subject to a Maturity Amendment does not exceed 15 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount provided that the requirements in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply to a restructuring of a Defaulted Obligation. If the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements of this paragraph but by way of scheme of arrangement or otherwise, the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity has been extended, the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager acting on its behalf may but shall not be required to sell such Collateral Obligation provided that in any event the Portfolio Manager shall dispose of such Collateral Obligation prior to the Maturity Date. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
Expiry of the Reinvestment Criteria Certification

Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee shall rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including, for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Obligations.
Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test

During the Reinvestment Period, if, on any Payment Date during such period after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Priority of Payments, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test has not been satisfied, then on the related Payment Date, Interest Proceeds in an amount (such amount, the "Required Diversion Amount") equal to the lesser of (1) 50.0 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (V) of the Interest Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Priority of Payments would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be satisfied shall be paid, at the discretion of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) (i) into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds; or (ii) in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence.
Designation for Reinvestment

After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Portfolio Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Portfolio Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (i) Purchased Accrued Interest; (ii) any interest received in respect of any Mezzanine Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Deferring Mezzanine Obligation other than Defaulted Mezzanine Excess Amounts; and
(iii) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.
Accrued Interest

Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account at the discretion of the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and Condition 3(l) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such
Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute "Purchased Accrued Interest" and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
Block Trades

The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Obligations on any day in the event that such Collateral Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria at the election of the Portfolio Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Obligation or a group of Collateral Obligations) identified by the Portfolio Manager as such at the time (an "Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date") may when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a "Trading Plan") may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the 20 Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the "Trading Plan Period"); provided that: (i) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation being the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Fitch Collateral Value for the purposes of determining the Collateral Principal Amount) as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period; (ii) no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date; (iii) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period; (iv) no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligations purchased at separate times for purposes of determining whether any particular Collateral Obligation is a Discount Obligation; (v) if the Reinvestment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan, but are not satisfied upon the completion of the related Trading Plan, prior Rating Agency Confirmation is obtained with respect to the effectiveness of additional Trading Plans (it being understood that Rating Agency Confirmation shall only be required once following any failure of a Trading Plan); (vi) none of the proposed investments may have a stated maturity shorter than six months from such date of determination; and (vii) no Trading Plan may be entered into following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period if: (a) any of the Collateral Obligations which form part of such Trading Plan have Collateral Obligation Stated Maturities shorter than six months; and (b) the differential between the shortest and the longest maturities of the related Collateral Obligations forming part of such Trading Plan exceeds two years; provided further that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of maturity dates of Collateral Obligations for the purposes of determining compliance with paragraph (i) in "Reinvestment Criteria" - "Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period". For the avoidance of doubt, compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria upon completion of a Trading Plan pursuant to (v) above, shall be calculated with respect to those Collateral Obligations that were actually sold and/or purchased as part of the relevant Trading Plan on the basis of data used as at the Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date.
Eligible Investments

The Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s), the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account, the Collection Account and the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations

The Portfolio Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time, purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Obligations being so purchased.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or by means of a Portfolio Manager Advance. Pursuant to Condition 3(l)(vi) (Supplemental Reserve Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise amounts which the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations may be sold at any time and all Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test or Collateral Quality Tests.
Exercise of Warrants and Options

The Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may at any time exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall on behalf of the Issuer instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment pursuant to a duly completed form of instruction.
Margin Stock

The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement requires that the Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavours to sell any Collateral Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Collateral Enhancement Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.
"Margin Stock" means margin stock as defined under Regulation U issued by the Federal Reserve Board, including any debt security which is by its terms convertible into Margin Stock.
Non-Euro Obligations

Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager shall from time to time be authorised to purchase, on behalf of the Issuer, Non-Euro Obligations provided that any such Non-Euro Obligation shall only constitute a Collateral Obligation that satisfies paragraph
(b) of the Eligibility Criteria if the Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, into a Currency Hedge Transaction (which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Obligation) pursuant to which the currency risk arising from receipt of cash flows from such Non-Euro Obligations, including interest and principal payments, is hedged through the swapping of such cash flows for Euro payments to be made by a Currency Hedge Counterparty. The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 20 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations. Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) shall be authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer's payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction. Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in relation to entry into each Currency Hedge Transaction unless such Currency Hedge Transaction is a Form Approved Hedge. See the "Hedging Arrangements" section of this Offering Circular.
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations

The Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire Collateral Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations from time to time.
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euro) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.
Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee or other ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof in the event of any default by the obligor thereof in respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder. Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations. To the extent required, the Issuer, or the Portfolio Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a
third party from time to time as collateral for any reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt by the Collateral Administrator of an Issuer Order (as defined in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) the security granted thereover shall be released pursuant to the Trust Deed.
Participations

The Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:
(a) the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution will not exceed the percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party (or any guarantor thereof); and
(b) the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions (or any guarantor thereof, provided that any guarantee in respect of the obligations of Selling Institutions must satisfy the then current S&P guarantee criteria), each having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating,
and, for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly, derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Obligation.
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a sub-participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of:
(a) the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);
(b) the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or
(c) such other documentation provided such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as that set out in the Trust Deed.
Assignments

The Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Assignment is acquired the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
"Assignment" means an interest in a loan acquired directly by way of novation or assignment.
Bivariate Risk Table

The following is the bivariate risk table (the "Bivariate Risk Table") and as referred to in "Portfolio Profile Tests" below and "Participations" above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the "Third Party Exposure") and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the S&P or Fitch ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.

* As a percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of the third party credit exposure of all such Counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.
** Provided that a Selling Institution having an S&P credit rating of "A" must also have a short-term S&P rating of "A-1" otherwise its "Individual Third Party Credit Exposure Limit" and "Aggregate Third Party Credit Exposure Limit" (set forth above) shall be 0%.
Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests
Measurement of Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Measurement Date (save as otherwise provided herein).
Substitute Collateral Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to purchase such Substitute Collateral Obligations but such purchase has not been settled shall nonetheless be deemed to have been purchased for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests. Collateral Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to sell such Collateral Obligations, but such sale has not been settled, shall be deemed to have been sold for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests. See "Reinvestment of Collateral Obligations" above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio to meet the requirements of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Obligation from being a Collateral Obligation.
Portfolio Profile Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) not less than 90.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Obligations (which term, for the purposes of this paragraph (a), shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date);
(b) not less than 70.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Secured Senior Loans (which term, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and the Balances standing to the credit

(n) not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of Corporate Rescue Loans provided that not more than 2.0 per cent. thereof shall consist of Corporate Rescue Loans from a single Obligor;
(o) not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are PIK Securities;
(p) not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations;
(q) not more than 12.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall be obligations comprising any one Fitch industry classification provided that: (i) any three Fitch industry classifications may comprise in aggregate up to 40.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount; (ii) any one Fitch industry classification may comprise up to 17.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount and (iii) one additional Fitch industry classification may comprise up to 15.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount;
(r) not more than 17.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations comprising any one S&P Industry Classification Group;
(s) not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of Obligors who are Domiciled in countries or jurisdictions with a country ceiling rating below "AAA" by Fitch unless Rating Agency Confirmation from Fitch is obtained;
(t) not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of Obligors who are Domiciled in countries or jurisdictions rated below "A-" by S&P unless Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P is obtained;
(u) the limits set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the ratings of Selling Institutions shall be satisfied;
(v) not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations issued by Obligors each of which has total current indebtedness (comprising all financial debt owing by the Obligor including the maximum available amount or total commitment under any revolving or delayed draw loans) under its respective loan agreements and other debt instruments (including the Underlying Instruments) of equal to or greater than EUR 200,000,000 but less than EUR 250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount;
(w) not more than 2.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Annual Obligations;
(x) not more than 20.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Discount Obligations;
(y) not more than 22.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of Collateral Obligations of the ten largest Obligors, such Obligors being determined by the proportion of the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations they each represent at the relevant date of determination; and
(z) not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of Credit Estimate Obligations.
"Bridge Loan" shall mean any Collateral Obligation that: (i) is incurred in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a person, restructuring or similar transaction; (ii) by its terms, is required to be repaid within one year of the incurrence thereof with proceeds from additional borrowings or other refinancings (provided, however, that any additional borrowing or refinancing having a term of more than one year may be included as a Bridge Loan if one or more financial institutions shall have provided the Obligor with a binding written commitment to provide the same); and (iii) prior to its purchase by the Issuer, has an S&P Rating and a Fitch Rating or, if the Bridge Loan is not rated by S&P and Fitch, Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained from S&P.
"Credit Estimate Obligation" means any Collateral Obligation for which the S&P Rating is based on a confidential credit estimate rather than a public or private rating from S&P.
The percentage requirements applicable to different types of Collateral Obligations specified in the Portfolio Profile Tests shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of such type of Collateral Obligations excluding Defaulted Obligations, as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount. The Collateral Principal Amount for the purposes of each Portfolio Profile Test shall be calculated in accordance with the definition thereof (where for such purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value). Obligations for which the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to purchase but have not yet settled shall be included for the purposes of calculating the Portfolio Profile Tests and obligations for which the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to sell, but have not yet settled, shall be excluded for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests.
Further, for the purposes of calculating compliance with the Portfolio Profile Tests:
(i) in the case of sub-paragraph (a) and (b) thereof, each relevant percentage shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.1 per cent.; or
(ii) in the case of any other sub-paragraph, each relevant percentage shall be rounded down to the nearest
0.1 per cent.
Collateral Quality Tests

The Collateral Quality Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) so long as any Notes rated by S&P are Outstanding (as of the Effective Date and until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only) the S&P CDO Monitor Test:
(b) so long as any Notes rated by Fitch are Outstanding:
(i) the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test;
(ii) the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test; and
(iii) the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test; and
(c) so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding the Weighted Average Life Test, each as defined in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The S&P CDO Monitor Test

The "S&P CDO Monitor Test" is a test that will be satisfied on any Measurement Date on or after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period if, after giving effect to the purchase of a Collateral Obligation, the S&P CDO Adjusted BDR is equal to or greater than the S&P CDO SDR. The S&P CDO Monitor Test shall only be applicable to the Class A Notes.
"S&P CDO Adjusted BDR" means the value calculated based on the following formula (or such other published formula by S&P that the Portfolio Manager provides to the Collateral Administrator):

"S&P Industry Diversity Measure" means the value calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets within each S&P Industry Classification Group, then dividing each of these amounts by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from all the industries, then squaring the result for each industry, and then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
"S&P Obligor Diversity Measure" means the value calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from each Obligor and its affiliates, then dividing each of these amounts by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all S&P CLO Specified Assets from all the Obligors in the Portfolio, then squaring the result for each Obligor, then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
"S&P Recovery Identifier" means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation for which an S&P Recovery Rate is being determined, the identifier published by S&P, incorporating the S&P Recovery Rating and the S&P Recovery Range based upon the tables set forth in Annex A (S&P Recovery Rates) hereto.
"S&P Recovery Range" means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation for which an S&P Recovery Rate is being determined, the upper or lower range assigned by S&P for a given S&P Recovery Rating based upon the tables set forth in Annex A (S&P Recovery Rates) hereto.
"S&P Recovery Rate" means, in respect of each Collateral Obligation and an assumed S&P Rating of "AAA", an S&P Recovery Rate determined in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or as advised by S&P. Extracts of the S&P Recovery Rates applicable under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement are set out in Annex A (S&P Recovery Rates) hereto.
"S&P Regional Diversity Measure" means the value calculated by determining the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets within each Standard & Poor's region categorization (set out in the "CDO Evaluator Country Codes, Regions and Recovery Groups" table in Annex A (S&P Recovery Rates) hereto), or such other published table by S&P that the Portfolio Manager provides to the Collateral Administrator, then dividing each of these amounts by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets from all regions in the portfolio, then squaring the result for each region, then taking the reciprocal of the sum of these squares.
"S&P Weighted Average Life" means the value calculated by determining the number of years between the current date and the maturity date of each S&P CLO Specified Asset, then multiplying each S&P CLO Specified Asset's Principal Balance by such number of years, and then summing this amount of all S&P CLO Specified Assets, and dividing this amount by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all S&P CLO Specified Assets.
"S&P Weighted Average Rating Factor" means the value calculated by multiplying the Principal Balance for each S&P CLO Specified Asset by its S&P Global Ratings Factor, then summing the results of all S&P CLO Specified Assets, and then dividing this result by the Aggregate Principal Balance of the S&P CLO Specified Assets.
"S&P Weighted Average Recovery Rate" means, as of any Measurement Date the number (expressed as a percentage) obtained by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance (excluding Purchased Accrued Interest) of each Collateral Obligation, by its S&P Recovery Rate, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations, and rounding up to the nearest 0.1 per cent. For the purposes of this rate, the Principal Balance of any Defaulted Obligation shall be deemed to be zero.
Fitch Tests Matrices

Subject to the provisions below, on or after the Effective Date the Portfolio Manager will have the option to elect which of the matrices set out below (the "Fitch Tests Matrices", each a "Fitch Tests Matrix") and which of the cases set forth in such matrices shall be applicable for purposes of the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. The Portfolio Manager will have the option to use linear interpolation within and between the Fitch Tests Matrices. For any given case:
(a) the applicable column for performing the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns in a given matrix and/or two columns (or interpolated columns) across matrices, as applicable) in the Fitch Tests Matrices (or interpolated matrices) selected by the Portfolio Manager;
(b) the applicable row for performing the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows in a given matrix and/or two rows (or interpolated rows) across matrices, as applicable) in the Fitch Tests Matrices (or interpolated matrices) selected by the Portfolio Manager; and
(c) the applicable column and row for performing the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test will be the column and row (or interpolated rows and/or columns as described in (a) and (b) above, as applicable) in the Fitch Tests Matrices (or interpolated matrices) selected by the Portfolio Manager in relation to (a) and (b) above.
On or before the Issue Date, the Portfolio Manager will elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter, on two Business Days' notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and Fitch, the Portfolio Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test, and the concentration limits applicable to the largest 10 Obligors by Principal Balance and Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations applicable to the case to which the Portfolio Manager desires to change are satisfied or, in the case of any such tests or concentration limits that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Portfolio Manager be obligated to elect to have a different case apply. The Fitch Tests Matrices may be amended and/or supplemented and/or replaced by the Portfolio Manager subject to Rating Agency Confirmation from Fitch.
Solely for the purposes of determining satisfaction of the Reinvestment Criteria (both during and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period), the concentration limits for the largest 10 Obligors by Principal Balance applicable to the case set out in a Fitch Tests Matrix (or a linear interpolation between any two Fitch Tests Matrices in the case of a linear interpolation) selected by the Portfolio Manager in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs, shall be deemed to be a "Collateral Quality Test" for so long as such case remains the case selected by the Portfolio Manager.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Portfolio Manager may elect to interpolate between the Fitch Tests Matrices with respect to both the largest ten Obligors represented in the Collateral Obligations by Principal Balance and the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount which consists of Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.

The Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test

"Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test" means that test that will be satisfied, on any Measurement Date, if the Fitch Weighted Average Rating Factor as at such date is less than or equal to the applicable level in the Fitch Tests Matrices.
"Fitch Weighted Average Rating Factor" is the number determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation by its Fitch Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all such Collateral Obligations and rounding the result down to the nearest two decimal places. For the purposes of determining the Principal Balance and Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations in this definition, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be excluded.
"Fitch Rating Factor" means, in respect of any Collateral Obligation, the number set forth in the table below opposite the Fitch Rating in respect of such Collateral Obligation. The following table provides certain probabilities of default relating to Fitch Rating Factors. The information is subject to change and any probabilities of default in respect of Fitch Rating Factors may not at any time necessarily reflect the below table.

The Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test

"Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test" means the test that will be satisfied in respect of the Notes on any Measurement Date, if the Fitch Weighted Average Recovery Rate is greater than or equal to the applicable level in the Fitch Tests Matrices.
"Fitch Weighted Average Recovery Rate" means, as of any Measurement Date, the rate (expressed as a percentage) determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation by the Fitch Recovery Rate in relation thereto and dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations and rounding up to the nearest 0.1 per cent. For the purposes of determining the Principal Balance and Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations in this definition, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be excluded.
"Fitch Recovery Rate" means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation, the recovery rate determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (b) below or (in any case) such other recovery rate as Fitch may notify the Portfolio Manager from time to time:
(a) if such Collateral Obligation has a public Fitch recovery rating, or a recovery rating is assigned by Fitch in the context of provision by Fitch of a credit opinion to the Portfolio Manager, the recovery rate corresponding to such recovery rating in the table below (unless a specific recovery rate (expressed as a percentage) is provided by Fitch):

The Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test
The "Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test" means the test which will be satisfied if, as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, the Weighted Average Floating Spread plus the Weighted Average Coupon Adjustment Percentage equals or exceeds the Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread, in each case as at such Measurement Date.
"Fitch Minimum Weighted Average Spread" means the weighted average spread (expressed as a percentage) applicable to the Fitch Test Matrices.
"Weighted Average Floating Spread" as of any Measurement Date, is the number obtained by dividing:
(a) the amount equal to (i) the Aggregate Funded Spread plus (ii) the Aggregate Unfunded Spread plus (iii) the Aggregate Excess Funded Spread; by
(b) an amount equal to (i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Floating Rate Collateral Obligations as of such Measurement Date, in respect of any Deferring Security excluding any interest that has been deferred and capitalised thereon and (ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations which are subject to an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction which swaps the fixed rate on such Collateral Obligation for a floating rate,
in each case adjusted for any withholding tax deducted in respect of the relevant obligation which is neither grossed up nor recoverable under any applicable double tax treaty provided that for the purposes of the calculation of the Effective Date Non-Model CDO Monitor Test the adjustments set out in the definition thereof shall apply.
The "Aggregate Funded Spread" is, as of any Measurement Date, the sum of:
(a) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Obligation (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Non-Euro Obligations, Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation) that bears interest at a spread over
EURIBOR, (i) the stated interest rate spread on such Collateral Obligation above EURIBOR multiplied by (ii) the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation (excluding the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation or Revolving Obligation); provided that for purposes of this definition, the interest rate spread will be deemed to be, with respect to any Floating Rate Collateral Obligation that has a EURIBOR floor, (i) the stated interest rate spread plus, (ii) if positive, (x) the EURIBOR floor value minus (y) the greater of (A) EURIBOR as in effect for the current accrual period and (B) zero (for the purposes of this paragraph (a) only, each reference to "EURIBOR" so far as it relates to a Collateral Obligation shall mean EURIBOR as determined pursuant to the Underlying Instrument in respect of such Collateral Obligation);
(b) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Obligation (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Non-Euro Obligations, Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation) that bears interest at a spread over an index other than EURIBOR, (i) the excess of the sum of such spread and such index (or floor if such Floating Rate Collateral Obligation has a floor which is above the index) over the EURIBOR rate that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the corresponding interest rate in respect of such Floating Rate Collateral Obligation as of the immediately preceding interest determination date pursuant to the relevant Underlying Instrument (which spread or excess may be expressed as a negative percentage) multiplied by (ii) the Principal Balance of each such Collateral Obligation (excluding the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation or Revolving Obligation);
(c) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Obligation which is a Non-Euro Obligation (including, only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation) and subject to a Currency Hedge Transaction, (i) (A) the sum of the stated interest rate spread over EURIBOR (in respect of the applicable Hedge Agreement) payable by the applicable Currency Hedge Counterparty to the Issuer under the related Currency Hedge Transaction plus (B) in circumstances where the relevant Non- Euro Obligation contains a floor in its interbank offered reference rate, the excess rate of interest (if any) of such floor over the available interbank offered reference rate on the Measurement Date under the applicable Currency Hedge Transaction, multiplied by (x) in the case of Non-Euro Obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars, Sterling, Danish Krone, Swiss Francs, Swedish Krona or Norwegian Krone, 0.85; and (y) in the case of Non-Euro Obligations denominated in any other Qualifying Currency, 0.50, and (ii) the Principal Balance of such Non-Euro Obligation; and
(d) in the case of each Floating Rate Collateral Obligation which is a Non-Euro Obligation (including, only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation) and which is not subject to a Currency Hedge Transaction, the difference between (i) the annual interest amount payable by the relevant obligor converted to Euro at the applicable Spot Rate multiplied by (A) in the case of Non-Euro Obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars, Sterling, Danish Krone, Swiss Francs, Swedish Krona or Norwegian Krone, 0.85; and (B) in the case of Non-Euro Obligations denominated in any other Qualifying Currency, 0.50, and (ii) the product of (x) EURIBOR with respect to the Rated Notes as of the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date multiplied by (y) the outstanding Principal Balance of such Non-Euro Obligation,
provided that for such purpose:
a Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation which is subject to an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction which swaps the fixed rate on such Collateral Obligation for a floating rate shall be treated as a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation with a stated spread and index equal to the stated or applicable floating rate payable by the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to the Issuer under such Interest Rate Hedge Transaction; and
a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation which is subject to an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction which swaps the floating rate on such Collateral Obligation for a fixed rate shall be disregarded.
The "Aggregate Unfunded Spread" is, as of any Measurement Date, the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) for each Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation (other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring Securities), the related commitment fee or ticking fee then in effect as of such date and
(ii) the undrawn commitments of each such Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and Revolving Obligation as of such date.
The "Aggregate Excess Funded Spread" is, as of any Measurement Date, the amount obtained by multiplying:
(a) EURIBOR applicable to the Rated Notes during the Accrual Period in which such Measurement Date occurs; by
(b) the amount (not less than zero) equal to (i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations (excluding (x) for any Deferring Security, any interest that has been deferred and capitalised thereon and
(y) the Principal Balance of any Defaulted Obligation and (z) the principal balance of any Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation) as of such Measurement Date minus (ii) the Target Par Amount minus (iii) the aggregate amount of Principal Proceeds received from the issuance of additional notes pursuant to the Trust Deed.
The "Weighted Average Coupon Adjustment Percentage" means a percentage equal as of any Measurement Date to a number obtained by multiplying (a) the result of the Weighted Average Fixed Coupon minus the Reference Weighted Average Fixed Coupon, by (b) the number obtained by dividing the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Floating Rate Collateral Obligations, and which product may, for the avoidance of doubt, be negative, provided that there will be an adjustment in each case for any withholding tax deducted in respect of the relevant obligation which is neither grossed up nor recoverable under any applicable double tax treaty.
The "Reference Weighted Average Fixed Coupon" means, if any of the Collateral Obligations are Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations, 4 per cent., and otherwise, 0 per cent.
The "Weighted Average Fixed Coupon", as of any Measurement Date, is the number expressed as a percentage obtained by dividing:
(a) the amount equal to the Aggregate Coupon; by
(b) an amount equal to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations as of such Measurement Date,
in each case, excluding, for any Mezzanine Obligation, any interest that has been deferred and capitalised thereon (other than any such interest capitalised pursuant to the terms thereof which is paid for on the date of acquisition of such Mezzanine Obligation) and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations and Revolving Obligations.
The "Aggregate Coupon" is, as of any Measurement Date, the sum of:
(a) with respect to any Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation which is a Non-Euro Obligation and subject to a Currency Hedge Transaction (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations and Revolving Obligations), the product of (x) stated fixed rate payable by the applicable currency Hedge Counterparty to the Issuer under the related Currency Hedge Transaction and (y) the Principal Balance of such Non- Euro Obligation;
(b) with respect to any Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation which is a Non-Euro Obligation which is not subject to a Currency Hedge Transaction (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations and Revolving Obligations), an amount (converted into Euro at the Spot Rate) equal to the product of (x) stated coupon on such Collateral Obligation expressed as a percentage and (y) the Principal Balance of such Non-Euro Obligation; and
(c) with respect to all other Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations (including only the required non-deferrable, current cash pay interest required by the Underlying Instruments thereon and excluding Defaulted Obligations, Deferring Securities and the unfunded portion of any Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations and Revolving Obligations), the sum of the products obtained by multiplying, in the case of
each Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation, (x) the stated coupon on such Collateral Obligation expressed as a percentage and (y) the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation,
provided that for such purpose:
(i) a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation which is subject to an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction which swaps the floating rate on such Collateral Obligation for a fixed rate shall be treated as a Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation with a stated coupon equal to the stated fixed rate payable by the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to the Issuer under such Interest Rate Hedge Transaction; and
(ii) a Fixed Rate Collateral Obligation which is subject to an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction which swaps the fixed rate on such Collateral Obligation for a floating rate shall be disregarded.
Weighted Average Life Test

The "Weighted Average Life Test" will be satisfied on any Measurement Date if the Weighted Average Life as of such date is less than or equal to the number of years (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth thereof) during the period from such Measurement Date to 24 June 2027.
"Weighted Average Life" is, as of any Measurement Date with respect to all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring Securities, the number of years (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth thereof) following such date obtained by summing the products obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Life at such time of each such Collateral Obligation by (b) the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation and dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balance at such time of all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring Securities.
"Average Life" is, on any Measurement Date with respect to any Collateral Obligation, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the products of (a) the number of years (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth thereof) from such Measurement Date to the respective dates of each successive scheduled distribution of principal of such Collateral Obligation and (b) the respective amounts of principal of such scheduled distributions by (ii) the sum of all successive scheduled distributions of principal on such Collateral Obligation.
Rating Definitions
S&P Ratings Definitions

The "S&P Rating" means, with respect to any Collateral Obligation will be, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if there is an S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer of such Collateral Obligation by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Collateral Obligation (such guarantee to comply with the current S&P criteria on guarantees), then the S&P Rating shall be such rating (regardless of whether there is a published rating by S&P on the Collateral Obligations of such issuer, held by the Issuer, provided that private ratings (that is, ratings provided at the request of the Obligor) may be used for purposes of this definition if the related Obligor has consented to the disclosure thereof and a copy of such consent has been provided to S&P);
(b) if, there is no S&P Issuer Credit Rating of the issuer or guarantor by S&P but:
(i) there is a senior secured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be one sub-category below such rating;
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, but there is a senior unsecured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall equal such rating; and
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) above applies, but there is a subordinated rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be one sub-category above such rating;
(c) with respect to any Collateral Obligation that is a Current Pay Obligation, the S&P Rating applicable to such obligation shall be the issue level rating thereof and if there is no such issue level rating, the S&P Rating applicable to such Current Pay Obligation shall be "CCC-";
(d) with respect to any Collateral Obligation, that is a Corporate Rescue Loan:
(i) falling within paragraph (a) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned a public rating to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such public rating; or
(ii) falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned an S&P Issuer Credit Rating, or a credit estimate to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate (as applicable) provided that if no S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate is available but S&P has issued a public rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan then such public rating after notching in accordance with limb (b) above shall be the S&P Rating; or
(iii) upon application by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer) to S&P for a credit estimate, the applicable Corporate Rescue Loan shall be deemed to have an S&P Rating of "D"; and
(e) if there is no rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be determined (other than in the case of Corporate Rescue Loans and Current Pay Obligations) pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (ii) below:
(i) if such an obligation of the issuer is not a Corporate Rescue Loan and is publicly rated by Moody's or Fitch and any successors thereto, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing the S&P Rating set forth above except that the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (A) one sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the (i) Moody's rating if such Moody's rating is "Baa3" or higher or (ii) Fitch rating if such Fitch rating is "BBB-" or higher and (B) two sub-categories below the S&P equivalent of the (i) Moody's rating if such Moody's rating is "Ba1" or lower or (ii) Fitch rating if such Fitch rating is "BB+" or lower, provided that in each case, if the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations whose S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) exceeds 15.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Principal Balance, the S&P Rating of the excess of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations where the S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) over an amount equal to 15.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (calculated for this purpose on the basis that the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation is its S&P Collateral Value) shall be "CCC-" (for the purposes of this paragraph (e)(i), the Collateral Obligations whose S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) with the lowest S&P Collateral Value (expressed as a percentage of the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation as of the relevant date of determination) shall be determined to comprise such excess);
(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by S&P, and in connection therewith, the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer or the issuer of such Collateral Obligation shall, prior to or within thirty calendar days after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, apply (and concurrently submit all available information in respect of such application) to S&P for a credit estimate which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, if such information is submitted within such thirty day period, then, for a period of up to ninety calendar days after acquisition of such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating as determined by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion if (A) the Portfolio Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (upon which certificate the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator shall rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that it believes
that such S&P Rating determined by the Portfolio Manager is commercially reasonable and that the S&P Rating will be at least equal to such rating and (B) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations subject to an S&P Rating determined by the Portfolio Manager in accordance with (A) does not exceed 5.0 per cent. of the Aggregate Principal Balance (for such purpose, the Principal Balance of all Defaulted Obligations shall be their S&P Collateral Value); provided further that (x) if such information is not submitted within such thirty day period and
(y) following the end of the ninety day period set forth above, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of "CCC-"; unless, in the case of clause (y) above, during such ninety day period, the Portfolio Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided further that if the Collateral Obligation has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a credit estimate in respect of such Collateral Obligation, the S&P Rating in respect thereof shall be "CCC-", pending receipt from S&P of such estimate and S&P may elect not to provide such estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided further that such credit estimate shall expire twelve months after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, following which such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of "CCC-" unless, during such twelve-month period, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) applies for renewal thereof in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement in which case such credit estimate shall continue to be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation; provided further that such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall expire on the next succeeding twelve-month anniversary of the date of the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation and (when renewed annually in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) on each twelve-month anniversary thereafter; and
(iii) with respect to a Collateral Obligation that is not a Defaulted Obligation, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation will at the election of the Issuer (at the direction of the Portfolio Manager) be "CCC-"; provided that (i) neither the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings; (ii) the Obligor thereof has not defaulted on any payment obligation in respect of any debt security or other obligation of such Obligor at any time within the two year period ending on such date of determination and all such debt securities and other obligations of the Obligor are current and the Portfolio Manager reasonably expects them to remain current; and (iii) the Collateral Obligation is current and the Portfolio Manager reasonably expects it to remain current,
and provided that, for purposes of the determination of the S&P Rating, (x) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on "credit watch positive" by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category above such assigned rating, (y) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on "credit watch negative" by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating and (z) only ratings assigned on the basis of ongoing surveillance (including any rating assigned by Moody's or Fitch) will be applicable for the purposes of determining the S&P Rating of a Collateral Obligation, and provided further that in the case only where the S&P Rating is derived from a rating assigned by Moody's or Fitch then the rating assigned by Moody's from which such S&P Rating is derived shall (x) if the applicable rating assigned by Moody's or Fitch to an Obligor or its obligations is on "credit watch positive" by Moody's or "rating watch positive" by Fitch, be treated as being one sub category above such assigned rating and
(y) if the applicable rating assigned by Moody's to an Obligor or its obligations is on "credit watch negative" by Moody's or "rating watch negative" by Fitch, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating; and with respect to any Collateral Obligation whose rating cannot be determined using any of the steps set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) above, the S&P Rating for such Collateral Obligation shall be "CC".
"S&P Issuer Credit Rating" means, in respect of a Collateral Obligation, a publicly available issuer credit rating by S&P in respect of the Obligor thereof.
Fitch Ratings Definitions

The "Fitch Rating" of any Collateral Obligation will be determined in accordance with the below methodology (with the sub-paragraph earliest in this definition applying in the case where more than one sub-paragraph would otherwise be applicable):
(a) with respect to any Collateral Obligation in respect of which there is a Fitch issuer default rating, including credit opinions, whether public or privately provided to the Portfolio Manager following notification by the Portfolio Manager that the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation (the "Fitch Issuer Default Rating"), the Fitch Rating shall be such Fitch Issuer Default Rating;
(b) if the Obligor thereof has an outstanding long-term financial strength rating from Fitch (the "Fitch LTSR"), then the Fitch Rating shall be one notch lower than such Fitch LTSR;
(c) if in respect of any other obligation of the Obligor or its Affiliates, there is a publicly available rating by Fitch, then the Fitch Rating shall be the Fitch IDR Equivalent determined by applying the Fitch Rating Mapping Table (as defined below) to such rating;
(d) if in respect of the Collateral Obligation there is a Moody's CFR, a Moody's Long Term Issuer Rating, or an S&P Issuer Credit Rating, then the Fitch Rating shall be the rating that corresponds to the lowest thereof;
(e) if in respect of the Collateral Obligation, there is an Insurance Financial Strength Rating, then the Fitch Rating shall be one notch lower than such Insurance Financial Strength Rating;
(f) if in respect of the Collateral Obligation there is a Moody's/S&P Corporate Issue Rating, then the Fitch Rating shall be the Fitch IDR Equivalent determined by applying the Fitch Rating Mapping Table (as defined below) to such rating;
(g) if a Fitch Rating cannot otherwise be assigned, the Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall apply to Fitch for a credit opinion which shall then be the Fitch Rating or shall agree a rating with Fitch which shall then be the Fitch Rating, provided that pending receipt from Fitch of any credit opinion, the applicable Collateral Obligation shall either be deemed to have a Fitch Rating of "B-", subject to the Portfolio Manager believing (in its reasonable judgement) that such credit assessment will be at least "B- " or the rating specified as applicable thereto by Fitch pending receipt of such credit assessment; provided further that if no credit opinion from Fitch is expected (in the opinion of the Portfolio Manager) to become available for the relevant Collateral Obligation and (i) the relevant Collateral Obligation is not a Defaulted Obligation or a Collateral Obligation with a Fitch IDR Equivalent of CCC+ or lower, (ii) the relevant Collateral Obligation has a private rating by Moody's, and (iii) the Principal Balance of the relevant Collateral Obligation when added to the Principal Balances of other such Collateral Obligations satisfying clauses (i) and (ii) of this proviso does not exceed 10 per cent of the Collateral Principal Amount, then the Fitch Rating of the relevant Collateral Obligation shall be deemed to be "B-", and if any of the clauses (i) to (iii) in the foregoing proviso are not met, the relevant Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Fitch Rating of "CCC";
(h) if such Collateral Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan:
(i) if such Corporate Rescue Loan has a publicly available rating from Fitch or has been assigned an issue-level credit assessment by Fitch, the Fitch Rating shall be such rating or credit assessment; or
(ii) otherwise the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer shall apply to Fitch for an issue-level credit assessment provided that, pending receipt from Fitch of any issue level credit assessment, the applicable Corporate Rescue Loan shall either be deemed to have a Fitch Rating of "B-", subject to the Portfolio Manager believing (in its reasonable judgement) that such credit assessment will be at least "B-" or the rating specified as applicable thereto by Fitch pending receipt of such credit assessment.
For the purposes of determining the Fitch Rating, the following definitions shall apply provided always that for a debt security or obligation of the Obligor has been in default during the past two years, the Fitch Rating of such
Collateral Obligation shall be treated as "D"; and provided further that if the applicable Collateral Obligation has been put on rating watch negative or negative credit watch for possible downgrade by:
(a) Fitch, then the rating used to determine the Fitch Rating above shall be one rating subcategory below such rating by Fitch;
(b) Moody's, in the case only where the Fitch Rating is derived from a rating assigned by Moody's then the Fitch Rating shall be one rating subcategory below what would otherwise be the Fitch Rating determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (h) above; or
(c) S&P, in the case only where the Fitch Rating is derived from a rating assigned by S&P then the Fitch Rating shall be one rating subcategory below what would otherwise be the Fitch Rating determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (h) above; and
(d) notwithstanding the rating definition described above, Fitch reserves the right to use a credit opinion or a rating estimate for any Collateral Obligations at any time,
and provided further that for the purposes of calculating the Fitch Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test when determining whether the Effective Date Determination Requirements are satisfied only, if the applicable Collateral Obligation has been put on negative outlook by:
(A) Fitch, then the rating used to determine the Fitch Rating above shall be one rating subcategory below such rating by Fitch;
(B) Moody's, then only in the case where the Fitch Rating is derived from a rating assigned by Moody's then the Fitch Rating shall be one rating subcategory below what would otherwise be the Fitch Rating determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (h) above; or
(C) S&P, then only in the case where the Fitch Rating is derived from a rating assigned by S&P then the Fitch Rating shall be one rating subcategory below what would otherwise be the Fitch Rating determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (h) above,
provided that if both paragraphs (B) and (C) above apply, then the Fitch Rating shall be the lower of that derived from paragraphs (B) and (C) and provided further that this paragraph may be disapplied by the Portfolio Manager subject to Rating Agency Confirmation from Fitch.
"Fitch IDR Equivalent" means, in respect of any rating described in the Fitch Rating Mapping Table, the equivalent Fitch Issuer Default Rating determined by increasing (or reducing, in the case of a negative number) such rating (or the nearest Fitch equivalent thereof) by the number of notches specified under "Mapping Rule" in the fourth column of the Fitch Rating Mapping Table.
"Fitch Rating Mapping Table" means the following table:

DESCRIPTION OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
The following description of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.

General
The Portfolio Manager will perform certain investment management functions, including, without limitation, supervising and directing the investment and reinvestment of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments, and perform certain administrative and advisory functions on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains procedures whereby the Portfolio Manager will have discretionary authority of the Issuer in relation to the composition, acquisition and management of the Portfolio.
EU Disclosure Requirements
The Portfolio Manager, the Originator and the Collateral Administrator will each undertake, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, to perform certain duties to enable the Issuer to comply with its reporting obligations under the Securitisation Regulation, as more fully described in "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements" section of this Offering Circular.
Liability of the Portfolio Manager
The Portfolio Manager will be required to perform its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement with reasonable care and in good faith, using a degree of skill and attention no less than that which the Portfolio Manager exercises with respect to comparable assets it manages for itself, its Affiliates and others and in accordance with practices followed by similar institutional managers of assets of the same nature and character as the Collateral in substantially similar types of transactions (the "Standard of Care"). To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the Portfolio Manager will follow its customary standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Portfolio Manager Parties") will not be liable to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Noteholders or any other person for any losses, costs, liabilities or claims incurred as a result of the acts or omissions by the Portfolio Manager Parties under or in connection with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, or for any decrease in the value of the Collateral Obligations or the performance by the Portfolio Manager of its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including, without limitation, directing the acquisition or disposition by the Issuer of any Collateral Obligation), except by reason of (i) acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence (with such term given its meaning under New York law) in the performance of, or reckless or intentional disregard with respect to, the duties of the Portfolio Manager thereunder (provided that a decline in the market value of any Collateral Obligation will not, by itself, constitute wilful misconduct or gross negligence by the Portfolio Manager) or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Portfolio Manager Information (including any amendment or supplement thereto contained in any amendment or supplement to this Offering Circular approved in writing by the Portfolio Manager) or any omission to state in the sections of this Offering Circular titled "Risk Factors – Certain Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Portfolio Manager and its Affiliates (including the Originator and the Portfolio Sub-Manager)", "Description of the Portfolio Manager", "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements – The Originator", "Description of Origination and the EU Retention and Disclosure Requirements
– Origination of Collateral Obligations", "U.S. Credit Risk Retention", "Description of the Portfolio Sub- Manager", "Description of the Portfolio Sub-Management Agreement" and the fifth paragraph of "Risk Factors
– Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules" (together, the "Portfolio Manager Information"), a material fact, in each case necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The matters described in (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred to as "Portfolio Manager Breaches" and each individually is a "Portfolio Manager Breach".
The Portfolio Manager, its Affiliates and their respective members, managers, stockholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Portfolio Manager Parties") will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (including any pecuniary sanctions to which the Portfolio Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation
Regulation not arising as a result of any act or omission that constitutes a Portfolio Manager Breach) which will be payable as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, and the Issuer will be entitled to indemnification by the Portfolio Manager as further described in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, no Portfolio Manager Party shall be indemnified as a result of any acts or omissions by any Portfolio Manager Party constituting Portfolio Manager Breaches. To the extent a Portfolio Manager Party is indemnified by the Issuer pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and the Priorities of Payment, the assets of the Issuer will be reduced accordingly and such reduction may result in a reduction in the amounts available to pay to the Noteholders. Additionally, the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement contains provisions which require that the Portfolio Manager shall not take any action on behalf of the Issuer which would cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or become otherwise subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax on a net income basis. The Portfolio Manager shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirement not to cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or become otherwise subject to U.S. federal, state or local tax on a net income basis as long as it causes the Issuer to comply with the Tax Guidelines.
The Portfolio Manager shall not be liable for any consequential or punitive losses or damages.
Securitisation Regulation Reporting Requirements
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, (i) the Issuer agrees to be the designated entity to make available to the Noteholders, any potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities (as determined under the Securitisation Regulation) the documents, reports and information necessary to fulfil any applicable reporting obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements; (ii) subject to any confidentiality obligations under law, regulation or contract binding upon it, the Portfolio Manager (subject to the Standard of Care under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) will undertake to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all reports, data and other information in its possession (or that can reasonably be procured by it) which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer as the reporting entity of such reporting obligations; and (iii) the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager shall propose to the Collateral Administrator in writing the form, content, timing and manner of publication of any such reports and information for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Collateral Administrator will consult with the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, will confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Portfolio Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the competent authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.
Compensation of the Portfolio Manager
As compensation for the performance of its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the Portfolio Manager will be entitled to receive from the Issuer on each Payment Date a senior portfolio management fee equal to 0.15 per cent. per annum (calculated semi-annually in respect of each semi- annual Due Period and quarterly at all other times, and, in each case, on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed in such Due Period, subject to as provided below) of the Collateral Principal Amount measured as of the first day of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next day which is a Business Day) as determined by the Collateral Administrator, which portfolio management fee will be payable senior to the Notes, but subordinated to certain fees and expenses of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (such fee, the "Senior Management Fee").
The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement also provides that the Portfolio Manager will receive from the Issuer on each Payment Date a subordinated portfolio management fee equal to 0.20 per cent. per annum (calculated semi-annually in respect of each semi-annual Due Period and quarterly at all other times, and, in each case, on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed in such Due Period, subject to as provided below) of the Collateral Principal Amount measured as of the first day of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next day which is a Business Day), as determined by the Collateral Administrator, which portfolio management fee will be payable senior to the payments on the Subordinated Notes, but subordinated to the Rated Notes (such fee, the "Subordinated Management Fee").
Each of the Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee , shall not include any VAT payable on such Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee. In the event that any supply to which
the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee relates is or becomes subject to VAT payable by the Portfolio Manager, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager in addition to such Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee against delivery of a valid VAT invoice, provided that the Portfolio Manager may agree to bear and (x) where the Portfolio Manager is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT (without prejudice to the requirement to provide a valid invoice) not receive additional amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT) or, (y) where the Issuer is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, receive a reduced amount in respect of the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee equal to the VAT exclusive amount of such fee expressed to be payable pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement less an amount equal to the VAT chargeable with respect thereto.
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee, as applicable, equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.
The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement also provides that the Portfolio Manager will be entitled to an Incentive Portfolio Management Fee on each Payment Date on which the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed, such fee being in an amount equal to and payable from 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and (subject as provided below) shall not include any VAT payable on such Incentive Portfolio Management Fee. In the event that any supply to which the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee relates is or becomes subject to VAT payable by the Portfolio Manager, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Portfolio Manager in addition to such Incentive Portfolio Management Fee against delivery of a valid VAT invoice, provided that the Portfolio Manager may agree to bear and (x) where the Portfolio Manager is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT (without prejudice to the requirement to provide a valid invoice) not receive additional amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT) or,
(y) where the Issuer is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, receive a reduced amount in respect of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee equal to the VAT exclusive amount of such fee expressed to be payable pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement less an amount equal to the VAT chargeable with respect thereto.
To the extent they are not paid when due on any Payment Date due to the operation of the Priorities of Payment (and not as the result of a waiver or deferral at the option of the Portfolio Manager), the Senior Management Fee, the Subordinated Management Fee and the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, and will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in respect of the Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee, EURIBOR and (ii) in respect of the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee, EURIBOR + 5.6 per cent. for the period from (and including) the date on which such Senior Management Fee, Subordinated Management Fee or Incentive Portfolio Management Fee is due and payable to (but excluding) the date of payment thereof.
The Portfolio Manager may elect to defer any Senior Management Fees and Subordinated Management Fees. Any amounts so deferred shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. To the extent that the Portfolio Manager elects to defer all or a portion thereof and later rescinds such deferral election, the Senior Management Fee and/or the Subordinated Management Fee so deferred, as applicable, will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Any due and unpaid Portfolio Management Fees including any Deferred Senior Portfolio Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Portfolio Management Amounts shall not accrue any interest.
The Portfolio Manager may elect to irrevocably waive or designate for reinvestment some or all of the amounts that would have been payable to the Portfolio Manager as the Incentive Portfolio Management Fee under the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments on a Payment Date. Any such amounts designated for reinvestment shall be used to purchase Substitute Collateral Obligations or be deposited in the Principal Account pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations. Any such amounts irrevocably waived shall be applied to the payment of interest or principal (as applicable) on the Subordinated Notes, subject to and in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments (as applicable).
Manager Expenses
The Issuer will reimburse the Portfolio Manager for all Manager Expenses. The Portfolio Management Fees and Manager Expenses payable to the Portfolio Manager on any Payment Date are payable only pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
On the Issue Date, the Portfolio Manager will be reimbursed by the Issuer for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of the initial Collateral Obligations and the issuance of the Notes (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses).

Any rights of the Portfolio Manager stated to survive the termination of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement shall remain vested in the Portfolio Manager after such termination in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement.
Resignation
The Portfolio Manager may resign, subject to the appointment of a successor Portfolio Manager in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, with or without cause and without penalty, upon at least 90 days' written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, and each Rating Agency (or upon such shorter notice as may be agreed between the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager).
Appointment of Successor
Upon any removal or resignation of the Portfolio Manager (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Portfolio Manager to carry on its duties under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement), the Portfolio Manager will continue to act in such capacity until the appointment by the Issuer, at the direction of the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) of an Eligible Successor in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, provided that the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) does not object in writing to such successor within 30 days after receipt of notice of such appointment. The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Portfolio Manager to assume the duties and obligations of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. If within 60 calendar days following a notice of resignation or removal, the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution) do not direct the Issuer to appoint an Eligible Successor or no Eligible Successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, then the holders of the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may direct the Issuer to appoint an Eligible Successor and the Issuer shall appoint such successor unless the holders of all Rated Notes (voting as a single class) object to such appointment (acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution). If within 90 days following a notice of resignation or removal no Eligible Successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Portfolio Manager may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor. For the avoidance of doubt, no Notes held in the form of PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or PM Non-Voting Notes or held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person shall have any voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting any PM Replacement Resolution or with respect to the selection or appointment of the successor Portfolio Manager following a PM Removal Resolution.

Upon notice of removal or resignation of the Portfolio Manager
In the event that the Portfolio Manager has received prior written notice of its removal in accordance with the terms specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor Portfolio Manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, purchases and sales of Collateral Obligations shall be only made in relation to sale of Margin Stock, Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any purchase or sale trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).
Delegation
Save for the delegation of signing authority to agent banks in connection with amendments to the terms of Collateral Obligations and the performance of any of its duties either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, the obligations of the Portfolio Manager under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement may not
be delegated, in whole or in part, except to an Affiliate that is legally qualified and has the requisite regulatory capacity to provide such services and provided that without the prior written consent of the Noteholders of each Outstanding Note, such appointment will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Portfolio Management Fees becoming subject to value added or similar tax or otherwise cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding any such consent, no such delegation of duties by the Portfolio Manager shall relieve it from any liability under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement. As at the Issue Date, the Portfolio Manager will delegate certain of its obligations under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement to the Portfolio Sub-Manager. See "Description of the Portfolio Sub-Management Agreement".

The Issuer may not assign its rights under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement without the prior written consent of the Portfolio Manager, the holders of each Class of Notes (excluding any holders of PM Non-Voting Notes and PM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes) acting by Ordinary Resolution, each voting as a separate Class, and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation, except in the case of an assignment by the Issuer (i) to an entity that is a successor to the Issuer permitted under the Trust Deed or (ii) to the Trustee.
In the event of any assignment or transfer by a party to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, the assignee or transferee shall execute and deliver such documents as may be reasonably necessary to effect fully such assignment or transfer and the assignee or transferee shall be required to make all the representations, mutatis mutandis, as set out therein as on the date of assignment or transfer. Any transfer of obligations made in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement shall bind the transferee in the same manner as the transferor is bound. In addition, in the case of an assignment or transfer by the Portfolio Manager, the assignee or transferee shall execute and deliver to the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Rating Agencies then rating the Notes a counterpart of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement naming
such assignee or transferee as the Portfolio Manager (with or without any changes to or omission of the provisions relating to the Retention Notes as may be required in accordance with the terms of such provisions). In the case of a transfer of obligations, upon the execution and delivery of such a counterpart by the relevant transferee, the Portfolio Manager shall be released from further obligations pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, except with respect to its agreements and obligations arising under various sections of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to such transfer and except with respect to its obligations under certain provisions relating to confidentiality, limited recourse and non-petition.

Any Notes (including Rated Notes and Subordinated Notes) held by or on behalf of the Portfolio Manager or any Portfolio Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of, voting on any PM Removal Resolution or PM Replacement Resolution.

Such policies and procedures include, in the case of the Collateral Obligations, systems for identifying Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations.

(a) it will subscribe for (at the initial issuance and each subsequent date of additional issuance of Notes) and retain as an "originator" for the purposes of the EU Retention Requirements, on an ongoing basis and for its own account, a material net economic interest in the transaction which will be comprised of not less than 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount on the date of determination (the "Minimum Retained Amount") in the form specified in Articles 6(1) and 6(3)(d) of the Securitisation Regulation, in each case, as in effect at the Issue Date, by holding Subordinated Notes with a Principal Amount Outstanding of not less than 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount on the date of determination (the "Retention Notes");
(b) it and its Affiliates will not sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under or associated with the Retention Notes or the underlying portfolio of Collateral Obligations, unless expressly permitted by the EU Retention Requirements;
(c) in relation to every Collateral Obligation and Eligible Investment (other than cash or those acquired from Interest Proceeds) it sells or transfers to the Issuer:
(i) it, either itself or through related entities, directly or indirectly, was involved or will be involved in the original agreement which created or will create such obligation; or
(ii) it purchased or will purchase such Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment for its own account prior to selling such obligation to the Issuer;
(d) it will not take, or fail to take, any action the result of which would, or could, result in it ceasing to be directly or indirectly wholly-owned by Onex Corporation;

(iii) its responsible decision makers have the required experience to enable it to pursue its established business strategy, as well as an adequate corporate governance arrangement;
(e) upon the acquisition of any loan, security or other investment which may later be acquired (or committed to be acquired) by the Issuer as a Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment, it has, or reasonably expects that it would have or be able to arrange, sufficient funding to settle such loan, security or other investment for its own account;
(f) it will confirm its continuing compliance with its obligations under the Retention Undertaking Letter to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator (who will in turn promptly notify the Trustee, the Sole Arranger and the Initial Purchaser) (i) on a monthly basis (concurrently with the delivery of each Monthly Report), (ii) upon the written request by or on behalf of the Issuer as a result of any material change in the performance of the Notes, the risk characteristics of the Transaction, or the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments from time to time, (iii) upon the occurrence of any Note Event of Default and

Notwithstanding the covenants set out above and in the Retention Undertaking Letter, the Originator may transfer the Retention Notes to the extent such transfer would not cause (i) the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the EU Retention Requirements and (ii) the Portfolio Manager to be in breach of its obligations under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.
"Purchase and Sale Agreement" means the master settlement agreement dated as of 20 September 2019, between the Issuer and the Originator, relating to the sale of Collateral Obligations from the Originator to the Issuer from time to time.
The Originator's undertakings in respect of the Retention Notes will be made as of the Issue Date, but the Originator will not have any obligation to change the quantum, method or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes as a result of any changes to the EU Retention Requirements or any other changes to regulations or the interpretation thereof following the Issue Date.
Origination of Collateral Obligations
The Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement provides that the Issuer may acquire Collateral Obligations from the Originator from time to time. Purchases of Collateral Obligations from the Originator will be required to be made in accordance with the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act.
The Originator may acquire Collateral Obligations in the primary market or the secondary market from third parties ("Market Sellers"). With respect to each Collateral Obligation that the Issuer ultimately purchases from the Originator, the Issuer will purchase such Collateral Obligation on the same trade date on which the Originator agreed to purchase such Collateral Obligation from a Market Seller by first entering into an agreement to purchase such Collateral Obligation from an Affiliate of the Originator, @Onex Holdings LLC ("@Onex"), on such trade date. @Onex is a limited liability company organised in 2000 under Delaware law. @Onex is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Onex Corporation and serves as a holding company. The purchase price to be paid by the Issuer to @Onex for such Collateral Obligation will be an amount equal to the market price for such Collateral Obligation as of such trade date. No earlier than two (2) Business Days following such trade date, it is expected that the rights and obligations of @Onex in respect of the sale of such Collateral Obligation will be transferred to the Originator by novation. In connection with such novation, (a) to the extent the market value of such Collateral Obligation has increased since the original trade date therefor, @Onex will compensate the Originator for any such increase and (b) to the extent the market value of such Collateral Obligation has decreased since the original trade date therefor, the Originator will compensate @Onex for any such decrease. As a result, the Originator will be exposed to market risk on such Collateral Obligations for at least the period between its purchase and any onward sale under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Pursuant to the novation, the Originator will have assumed all obligations of @Onex to sell such Collateral Obligation to the Issuer and will be obligated to sell such Collateral Obligation to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and at the market price initially agreed to between the Issuer and @Onex on the original trade date therefor. The Purchase and Sale Agreement shall also provide that if, on the date that is 15 days after the original trade date in respect of the purchase of such Collateral Obligation by the Originator (the "Originator Interest Period"), either (a) a payment default with respect to the interest or principal due and payable under such Collateral Obligation has occurred and is continuing or (b) there has been a bankruptcy, receivership or other insolvency proceeding or reorganisation event in each case with respect to the underlying obligor of such Collateral Obligation, then the Issuer will not be obligated to purchase or pay the applicable purchase price in respect of such Collateral Obligation (or, to the extent the Issuer has purchased or paid the applicable purchase price in respect of such Collateral Obligation prior to the last day of such Originator Interest Period, the Originator will repurchase such Collateral Obligation at the applicable purchase price for such Collateral Obligation paid by the Issuer). As a result, the Originator will be exposed to such payment or bankruptcy risk on such Collateral Obligations for the period between its purchase by the Originator and the end of the applicable Originator Interest Period. In connection with such purchases from the Originator, the Issuer will reimburse the Originator for any reasonable expenses incurred by the Originator in connection with the purchase and sale of the Collateral Obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
OMI is the Originator and is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Onex Corporation. OMI is a Delaware limited liability company established in 2008 to hold certain investments. OMI, in its capacity as Originator is expected to purchase and retain certain Subordinated Notes and expects to acquire certain Collateral Obligations to be sold to the Issuer pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as described in this Offering Circular. In addition to acting as Originator, OMI also acquires and sells a number of other assets and engages in other transactions. As of 31 March 2020, OMI had approximately $1.3 billion of assets unrelated to its role as Originator. OMI has
existing financing arrangements with its parent, Onex Corporation, including, but not limited to, intercompany loans. As of 31 March 2020, OMI had no external debt and has the ability to borrow from another wholly owned subsidiary of Onex Corporation. Onex Corporation as of 31 March 2020 had no external debt and approximately
$1.9 billion of cash and near cash.
Originator Credit Granting and Selection of Assets
The Originator will not select assets to be transferred to the Issuer with the aim of rendering losses on such assets, over a maximum period of four years, higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on its balance sheet.
The Originator shall use reasonable commercial efforts to, in respect of each Originated Collateral Obligation, verify to the extent required pursuant to Article 9(3) of the Securitisation Regulation that the entity directly or indirectly involved in the original agreement which created such asset, has applied to the asset the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting that such entity applies to its non-securitised exposures.
EU Disclosure Requirements
In accordance with Article 7(2) of the Securitisation Regulation, each of the originator, sponsor and the Issuer (as applicable) are required to designate amongst themselves one entity to be the designated entity (the reporting entity) to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and competent authorities (together, the "Relevant Recipients"), the documents, reports and information necessary to fulfil the relevant reporting obligations under Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer shall, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, agree to be the reporting entity for this transaction.
Virtus Group LP, acting on behalf of the Issuer has made drafts of the applicable documentation referred to in Articles 7(1)(b) and 7(1)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation (the "Pre-Pricing Draft Documents") available to the Relevant Recipients before pricing of the Notes via a secure website currently located at http://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by Virtus Group LP to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and the Portfolio Manager from time to time), or by such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as instructed by the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf). Investors should note that the Pre-Pricing Draft Documents are subject to change and that on or after the Issue Date, each Pre-Pricing Draft Document will be replaced by the final or signed (as applicable) version of such document.
Pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement (i) subject to any confidentiality obligations under law, regulation or contract binding on it, the Portfolio Manager (subject to the Standard of Care under the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement) shall undertake to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer all reports, data and other information in its possession (or which it can reasonably procure) and which is reasonably required (as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) for the proper performance by the Issuer as the reporting entity of its obligations under the EU Disclosure Requirements and (ii) the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager shall propose to the Collateral Administrator in writing the form, content, timing and manner of publication of any such reports and information for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Requirements. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and, if it agrees to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager. If the Collateral Administrator does not agree to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Portfolio Manager) shall appoint another entity to make such information available to the competent authorities, any Noteholder and any potential investor in the Notes.
Compliance with certain reporting obligations under Articles 7(1)(a) and (e) of the Securitisation Regulation will only be required upon the occurrence of the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date.
Pursuant to the Retention Undertaking Letter the Originator, its officers, employees and directors will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer in relation to any liability to which it or they may be or become subject or which may be incurred by it or them in connection with the EU Disclosure Requirements, such loss being payable as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.

(D) any assumptions, discount factors or other variables used to determine any such fair value and (iii) assumes any responsibility for or has any liability for the contents of the fair value determination or any of the information in this section. The information contained in this section is calculated and presented as of 15 June 2020, has not been updated and, except to the extent required by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (as described under "Post Closing Update" below), will not be updated.

For important information about the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, see information under the headings "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules".
Each Person receiving this Offering Circular is advised that certain information in this section contains forward- looking statements. There can be no assurance that the predictions contained in such forward-looking statements will materialise or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in this section. See disclaimer regarding "Forward Looking Statements" appearing on page xi of this Offering Circular. Except to the limited extent set forth under "Post-Closing Update" below, no Person has undertaken or is under any obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw the information in this section.
The information appearing in this section is being provided based on information supplied and calculations made by the Portfolio Manager. In preparing the information in this section, the Portfolio Manager has relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information available to it from public sources or which was provided to it by its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties. The fair value determinations provided herein are provided solely for purposes of satisfying the disclosure requirements under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and are not intended to advise any investor as to the appropriate price or prices of any Notes or how the investors should consider the fair value of their investment or to be used as a basis on which to make an investment decision with respect to any of the Notes.
By purchasing any Note, each Noteholder will be deemed to have represented that (A) as a sophisticated investor, has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of making its own independent evaluation of the reasonableness and accuracy of the information contained in this section, (B) it has reviewed the disclosures in this section and understands the limitations of the methodologies and the information contained in this section and has been afforded an opportunity to request and to review, and has received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement the information in this section, (C) it approves the use of the methodology, inputs and assumptions described in this section, (D) it will make its own determination with respect to the fair value of any Notes including those that it purchases without reliance upon, or use of, in any manner whatsoever the information contained in this section and (E) it understands that the Issuer, the Originator and the Portfolio Manager are relying on the foregoing as a material inducement to enter this transaction and otherwise would not engage in this transaction.
The Originator
For the purposes of this transaction and the U.S. Risk Retention Rules: (a) the Portfolio Manager is considered to be the "sponsor", and (b) the Originator is considered to be a "majority-owned affiliate" of the Portfolio Manager because the Portfolio Manager and the Originator, who will hold the U.S. Retention Interest, are at least 50 per cent. owned by the same ultimate parent entity. The Originator will, on the Issue Date, purchase and intends to hold for as long as is required by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, Subordinated Notes in an amount equal to at least 5 per cent. of the "fair value" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) of all Notes issued on the Issue Date as an "eligible horizontal residual interest" (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules).
U.S. Risk Retention
Prospective investors should note the following in reviewing the contents of this section: (i) although the Portfolio Manager believes in good faith that the U.S. Risk Retention Arrangements (as defined below) will satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules as in effect on the Issue Date, there can be no assurances that the U.S. Risk Retention
Arrangements will satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, (ii) failure of the U.S. Risk Retention Arrangements to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules could have materially negative effects on the Portfolio Manager, the Issuer, the Notes and the investors in the Notes, (iii) while the disclosure set forth in this section is required under the
U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and although certain U.S. regulators may be entitled to take enforcement or other action against a sponsor that fails to comply with its obligations under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such rules do not appear to establish any rights of investors or other parties against the sponsor or any person for any failure to comply with such rules, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Portfolio Manager and the Originator expressly disclaims any liability (except for any liability of the Portfolio Manager to the Issuer that may arise under the express terms of the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, including as a result of any non-compliance in respect of any covenant therein to comply with applicable laws) to any investor or other party for any failure of the U.S. Risk Retention Arrangements to satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules or any other risk retention laws, and (iv) each of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee and their respective affiliates expressly disclaim any liability to any investor for any failure of the U.S. Risk Retention Arrangements to satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules or any other risk retention laws. See "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules".
On the Issue Date, the Originator is expected to purchase Subordinated Notes in an amount that is expected to have a fair value equal to at least 5% of the fair value of all Notes issued by the Issuer on the Issue Date (such required minimum amount, the "U.S. Retention Interest") determined using a fair value measurement framework under GAAP (as described below under "Fair Value of U.S. Retention Interest; Valuation Methodology") as of the Issue Date. The Originator's interest in the Subordinated Notes is expected to constitute an "eligible horizontal residual interest" under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. On the Issue Date, the Originator is expected to purchase approximately EUR 31,000,000 in principal amount of the Subordinated Notes, which the Portfolio Manager estimates to have a fair value, as of the Issue Date, of between EUR 21,245,570 and EUR 24,290,166, and which represents, as of the Issue Date, between 8.87% and 9.88% of the aggregate fair value of the Notes. Such preliminary determination was made in consultation with a third-party unaffiliated valuation firm.
For purposes of determining the range of fair values of the Notes, the Portfolio Manager estimated that each Class of Notes will have prices within the following ranges of their respective face amounts: the Class A Notes will have a price between 99.43% and 100.57%; the Class B-1 Notes will have a price between 99.22% and 100.79%; the Class B-2 Notes will have a price between 99.25% and 100.81%; the Class C Notes will have a price between 99.03% and 100.98%, the Class D Notes will have a price between 98.88% and 101.13%; the Class E Notes will have a price between 94.71% and 97.45%, the Class F Notes will have a price between 93.38% and 96.71%, and the Subordinated Notes will have a price between 68.53% and 78.36%.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Originator will not itself be required to hold the U.S. Retention Interest if (i) it transfers the U.S. Retention Interest to Onex Credit Partners, LLC or another "majority-owned affiliate" (as defined under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) of Onex Credit Partners, LLC or (ii) it, the Portfolio Manager and the Issuer have received written advice of nationally recognised counsel experienced in such matters that any such transfer or sale of the U.S. Retention Interest will not cause the Portfolio Manager or the Originator to be in violation of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (including as a result of the repeal of such rules). Subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer, the Originator may, at any time and from time to time, sell or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any Notes that it holds in excess of the portion it holds for the sponsor to comply with, and in accordance with, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The requirement to hold the U.S. Retention Interest as described herein is defined as the "U.S. Risk Retention Arrangements".
Fair Value of U.S. Retention Interest; Valuation Methodology
For important information about fair value determination, including without limitation the discussion on ASC 820 and the Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 tiers, see information under the heading "Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements – U.S. Risk Retention Rules".
To calculate the fair value of the Subordinated Notes that will be included in the U.S. Retention Interest, the Portfolio Manager used a discounted cash flow methodology to derive an estimate of value based on projected future cash flows on the Notes. In generating such projected future cash flows, a third-party cash flow modeling engine was used to project future interest and principal payments on the Collateral Obligations, the interest and principal payments on each Class of Notes, and the fees and expenses of the transaction parties. The resulting net cash flows to the Subordinated Notes were then discounted to present value using a discount rate intended to reflect a hypothetical market yield.
A third-party unaffiliated valuation firm was engaged to assist the Portfolio Manager in connection with certain of the calculations set forth in this section. Such third-party unaffiliated valuation firm performed certain financial analyses and relied on certain information provided to it by third parties or available from public sources as being accurate and complete in all respects and which the third-party unaffiliated valuation firm did not independently verify. The results of the financial analyses performed by such third-party unaffiliated valuation firm were among the factors taken into consideration in connection with certain of the calculations set forth in this section but were not determinative.

 Priorities of Payment: For purposes of the Priorities of Payment, (i) no taxes or governmental fees are owed by the Issuer, (ii) the aggregate of Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses will be equal to the full amount permitted by the definition of Senior Expenses Cap, (iii) no Special Redemption, Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing, issuance of additional Notes, Note Tax Event, Collateral Tax Event, Note Event of Default or acceleration of the Notes occurs with respect to any Payment Date after the Issue Date; (iv) there are no Principal Proceeds that the Portfolio Manager has determined cannot be reasonably reinvested in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria; and (v) there are no Defaulted Obligations in excess of that which is specified below, no Discount Obligations, no Excess CCC Adjustment Amounts and no accrued interest received in connection with any Collateral Obligation or Eligible Investment to the extent such amount was not purchased with Interest Proceeds;
 Initial Collateral Obligations: Collateral Obligations either owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date or identified to be purchased on or around the Issue Date will (i) have an aggregate principal amount of approximately EUR 250,000,000 and (ii) be comprised of 93.8% Floating Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a spread equal to 3.51% over EURIBOR and 6.2% Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a coupon equal to 2.35%;
 Reinvestment Collateral Obligations: Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer through reinvestment after the Issue Date will (i) be acquired for a purchase price equal to 92.5% for the first twelve months,
95.0% for the following twelve months, then 99.5% thereafter; (ii) approximately 100.0% be Floating Rate Collateral Obligations bearing interest at a spread equal to 3.50% over EURIBOR (with 100.0% of such Collateral Obligations having a EURIBOR floor of 0.00% and an all-in floor of 3.50%);
 Prepayment Rate: Prepayments on Collateral Obligations for each three month period are assumed to be equal to the product of (i) a constant annual prepayment rate of 10.0% for the first twelve months, then 25.0% thereafter, dividend by four; and (ii) the outstanding balance of the applicable Collateral Obligations as of the end of the immediately preceding three month period, after adjusting for any scheduled prepayments on the Collateral Obligations during such three month period;
 Default Rate: Defaulted Obligations for each three month period are assumed to be equal to the product of (i) an annual default rate of 4.0% for the first twelve months, then 2.0% thereafter ("Annual Default Rate"), divided by four and (ii) the outstanding balance of the applicable Collateral Obligations as of the end of the immediately preceding three month period;
 Recovery Rate: Recoveries on Defaulted Obligations are assumed to be at a recovery rate of 70.0% for the first twelve months, then 75.0% thereafter ("Assumed Recovery Rate"), and occur 12 months after each applicable default;
 Optional Redemption: 12 months after the end of the Reinvestment Period, with the Collateral Obligations being sold at par; and
 Forward Rates: EURIBOR is assumed to reset consistent with the applicable 3-month forward curve.
These key inputs and assumptions were based on certain publicly available market data and/or information provided by third-party sources (including, the third-party valuation agent) as well as considering the following factors:
 The discount rates were selected based on observations of market participants' expected rates of return in the new-issue market and secondary-trading market for CLOs specifically and, to a lesser extent, other comparable structured credit asset classes.
 The prepayment rate, default rate, the assumed recovery rate and assumed recovery lag were estimated considering the repayment rate, default rate and recovery rate and certain observed historical data (including trading prices) for loans similar to the Collateral Obligations.
 The assumed weighted average spread was estimated considering the price and spread and certain observed historical data for new issue and secondary loans similar to the Collateral Obligations.
 The assumed optional redemption date was estimated considering that in most circumstances Noteholders of Subordinated Notes will elect to call the CLO early if the return expected to be generated thereby is greater than the return expected to be generated from holding the Subordinated Notes to the final maturity date.
 The assumed interest rate ranges for the Notes were generally informed by recent new-issue spreads and refinancings of similarly rated CLO debt classes, with similar assumed pool and asset quality, payment priority and weighted average lives to the related Class of Notes as of the calculation date.
 The discount yield of the Subordinated Notes was generally informed by the discount yields observed on CLO notes, with similar assumed pool and asset quality, payment priority and weighted average lives to the Subordinated Notes as of the calculation date.
Post-Closing Update
Subject to the same limitations above in this section, including the disclaimer regarding "Forward Looking Statements," the first Monthly Report (or such earlier report as determined by the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager) delivered to the Noteholders after the Issue Date will include the following additional information provided by the Portfolio Manager (determined by the Portfolio Manager as of the Issue Date): (i) the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all Notes) and the Euro amount of the Subordinated Notes held by the Originator as of the Issue Date (based on actual sale prices and finalised Class sizes); (ii) the fair value (expressed as a percentage of the fair value of all Notes) and the Euro amount of the Subordinated Notes that the
Originator is required to retain pursuant to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (based on actual sale prices and finalised Class sizes); and (iii) to the extent that the valuation methodology or any of the key inputs and assumptions as of the Issue Date is materially different than those disclosed under "Fair Value of U.S. Retention Interest; Valuation Methodology" above, a description of any such material differences.

HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS
The following section consists of a summary of certain provisions which, pursuant to the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, are required to be contained in each Hedge Agreement and Hedge Transaction. Such summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of each Hedge Agreement and Hedge Transaction. The terms of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction may differ from the description provided herein, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof or without Rating Agency Confirmation if such Hedge Transaction constitutes a Form Approved Hedge.

Hedge Agreements
Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) may enter into transactions documented under a 1992 (Multicurrency - Cross Border) or a 2002 Master Agreement or such other form published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA"). Each Hedge Transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to a Hedge Agreement.
Each Hedge Transaction will be for the purposes of:
(a) in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction (which for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any interest rate cap transactions entered into by the Issuer on or around the Issue Date described in "Standard Terms of Interest Rate Cap Transactions" below), hedging any interest rate mismatch between the Rated Notes and the Collateral Obligations; and
(b) in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction, exchanging payments of principal, interest and other amounts in respect of any Non-Euro Obligation for amounts denominated in Euro at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate,
in each case subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (save in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and provided that the Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement (taking into account any guarantor thereof) and any applicable regulatory requirements.
The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase Non-Euro Obligations provided that, the Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Obligation, into a Currency Hedge Transaction which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Obligation (to become effective on or before the settlement date of such Collateral Obligation) with a Currency Hedge Counterparty (which satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and has regulatory capacity, as a matter of Irish law, to enter into derivative transactions with Irish residents) pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made to fund the Issuer's acquisition of the related Non-Euro Obligation and the final and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.
For the avoidance of doubt, the ability of the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf to enter into any Currency Hedge Transactions, and therefore the ability of the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf to acquire Non-Euro Obligations, is subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition.
"Form Approved Hedge" means either (i) an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction the documentation for and structure of which conforms to a form for which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received by the Issuer or which has previously been reviewed by the Rating Agencies and (in each case save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the name of the Collateral Obligation, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and other consequential and immaterial changes which have been notified in writing to the Rating Agencies) or (ii) a Currency Hedge Transaction the documentation for and structure of which conforms to a form for which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received by the Issuer or which has previously been reviewed by the Rating Agencies (in each case save for the amount and timing of periodic payments, the name of the Currency Hedge Obligation, the notional amount, the effective date, the termination date and other consequential and immaterial changes which have been notified in writing to the Rating Agencies).
Replacement Hedge Transactions
Currency Hedge Transactions: In the event that any Currency Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time other than in circumstances where the Portfolio Manager intends to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation on behalf
of the Issuer or a Redemption Date has or is scheduled to occur, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to enter into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction within 30 calendar days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
Interest Rate Hedge Transactions: In the event that any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the Defaulting Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to enter into a replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within 30 calendar days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
Standard Terms of Currency Hedge Transactions
Any Currency Hedge Transaction shall contain the following terms (provided that the Issuer may enter into Currency Hedge Transactions on different terms than those set forth below, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof or such Currency Hedge Transaction being a Form Approved Hedge):
(a) on the effective date of entry into such transaction, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an initial exchange amount in Euro equal to the purchase price of such Non-Euro Obligation, converted into Euro at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of an initial exchange amount in the relevant currency equal to the purchase price of such Non-Euro Obligation;
(b) on the scheduled date of termination of such transaction, which shall be the date falling two Business Days after the date on which the Non-Euro Obligation is scheduled to mature or such later date as otherwise specified in the relevant confirmation, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty a final exchange amount equal to the amount payable upon maturity of the Non-Euro Obligation in the relevant currency (the "Proceeds on Maturity") in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of a final exchange amount denominated in Euro, such final exchange amount to be an amount equal to the Proceeds on Maturity converted into Euro at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate;
(c) two Business Days following the date of each scheduled payment of interest on the related Non-Euro Obligation or such later date as otherwise specified in the relevant confirmation, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an amount in the relevant non-Euro currency based on the principal amount outstanding from time to time of the relevant Non-Euro Obligation (the "Non-Euro Notional Amount") and the Currency Hedge Counterparty will pay to the Issuer an amount based on the outstanding principal amount of the related Non-Euro Obligation converted into Euro at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate (the "Euro Notional Amount"); and
(d) following the sale of any Non-Euro Obligation, the Issuer shall pay to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an amount equal to the sale proceeds of such Non-Euro Obligation in the relevant currency (the "Proceeds on Sale") in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of an amount denominated in Euro, such amount to be an amount equal to the Proceeds on Sale converted into Euro at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate less any amounts payable to the Currency Hedge Counterparty in respect of the early termination of the relevant Currency Hedge Transaction (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no breakage or other costs will be payable to the Currency Hedge Counterparty in connection with a prepayment, repayment or redemption of the related Non-Euro Obligation).
The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall convert all amounts received by it in respect of any Non-Euro Obligation which is not the subject of a related Currency Hedge Transaction into Euro promptly upon receipt thereof at the then prevailing Spot Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account or the Interest Account, as applicable. The Portfolio Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is also authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer's payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction.
All amounts received by the Issuer in respect of Non-Euro Obligations shall be paid into the appropriate Currency Account and all amounts payable by the Issuer under any Currency Hedge Transaction (other than any initial exchange amounts payable in Euro by the Issuer, any Hedge Replacement Payments and any Currency Hedge
Issuer Termination Payments save to the extent otherwise provided in Condition 3(l)(ix) (Currency Accounts)), will be paid out of the appropriate Currency Account, in each case to the extent amounts are available therein.
The Issuer shall only be obliged to pay Scheduled Periodic Currency Hedge Issuer Payments to a Currency Hedge Counterparty if and to the extent it actually receives the corresponding amount in respect of the relevant Non- Euro Obligation.
Upon the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), and upon the Trustee (or any agent or appointee thereof), the Portfolio Manager or any other agent of the Issuer (including any insolvency practitioner, receiver or equivalent such person in any relevant jurisdiction), selling the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, the Currency Hedge Counterparty shall receive the proceeds of the sale of the Non-Euro Obligation from the Currency Account of the Issuer, outside of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and return the Euro equivalent amount owing, less any amount payable to the Currency Hedge Counterparty in respect of the early termination of the Currency Hedge Transaction in connection with such sale and the Currency Hedge Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding the above, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Currency Hedge Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, terminate any or all Currency Hedge Transactions in which case any Currency Hedge Issuer Termination Payment would be paid (following acceleration of the Notes) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) and the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments.
Standard Terms of Interest Rate Cap Transactions
On or around the Issue Date, the Issuer may enter into the Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. The Issuer will have no payment obligations in respect of any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transactions other than the payment of a premium in respect of each such transaction to the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty upon entry into such transactions.
The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) shall exercise any such Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction on any Business Day when EURIBOR is greater than the strike price set out in the applicable Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction.
The Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on behalf of the Issuer) shall not sell or transfer any Issue Date Interest Rate Hedge Transaction other than in circumstances where all of the Rated Notes have been redeemed or Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained from each Rating Agency in respect of any such sale or transfer.
Standard Terms of Hedge Agreements
Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is agreed by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in respect of any Form Approved Hedges).
Gross up

Under each Hedge Agreement, each of the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty shall represent that payments made by it under such Hedge Agreement (other than default interest) will not be subject to withholding tax imposed by its relevant jurisdiction. The Issuer will not be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder, however the applicable Hedge Counterparty may in certain circumstances be obliged to gross up a payment thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Any such event may however result in a "Tax Event" which is a "Termination Event" for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. In the event of the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement), each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant Affected Party (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours to (i) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (ii) (in the case of the Issuer) if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation).
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition

The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment); provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(l)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non- Petition).
Termination Provisions

Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of certain events, which may include but are not limited to:
(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account the applicable grace period;
(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or perform its obligations under, the applicable Hedge Agreement;
(d) a change in the regulatory status of the Issuer which cannot be remedied by a modification of the relevant Hedge Agreement, as further described in the relevant Hedge Agreement;
(e) any amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents without the written consent of the Hedge Counterparty which would have a material adverse effect on its rights thereunder, or as further described in the relevant Hedge Agreement;
(f) failure by a Hedge Counterparty to comply with the requirements of the Rating Agencies in the event that it (or, as relevant, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement;
(g) upon the early redemption in full or acceleration of the Notes; and
(h) any other event as specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement.
Hedge Agreements commonly also contain provisions which allow a Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of certain credit events or restructurings related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation.
A termination of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction does not constitute a Note Event of Default under the Notes though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an additional termination event under a Hedge Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or Termination Event (each as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement), a Hedge Agreement may be terminated by the Hedge Counterparty or the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) in accordance with the detailed provisions thereof and a lump sum (the "Termination Payment") may become payable by the Issuer to the applicable Hedge Counterparty or vice versa. Depending on the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement, such Termination Payment may be determined by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and/or Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf) by reference to market quotations obtained in respect of the entry into a replacement swap(s) on the same terms as that terminated or as otherwise described in the applicable Hedge Agreement or any loss suffered by a party, subject to and in accordance with the relevant Hedge Agreement.
Rating Downgrade Requirements

Each Hedge Agreement will contain provisions requiring certain remedial action to be taken in the event that the Hedge Counterparty (or, as relevant, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade, such provisions being in accordance with the rating methodology of the Rating Agencies at the time of entry into such Hedge
Agreements. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity (or, as relevant, its guarantor) meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.
Transfer and Modification

The Portfolio Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the regulatory capacity as a matter of Irish law to enter into derivatives transactions with Irish residents.
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.
Governing Law

Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder, in each case including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with English Law.
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data
The Portfolio Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time enter into agreements (each a "Reporting Delegation Agreement") for the delegation of certain derivative reporting obligations to one or more Hedge Counterparties or third parties (each, in such capacity, a "Reporting Delegate").

Miscellaneous

Each report shall state that each of the defined terms set out in Condition 1 (Definitions), which are set out in full in this Offering Circular and the Trust Deed, are incorporated by reference into the Reports together with the definitions of any technical terms which are used in the Reports and not so defined in this Offering Circular or Trust Deed (as provided to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer (or the Portfolio Manager on its behalf)).
Each report shall state that it is for the purposes of information only, that certain information included in the report is estimated, approximated or projected and that it is provided without any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness thereof and that none of the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager will have any liability for estimates, approximations or projections contained therein.
In addition, the Collateral Administrator shall provide the Issuer with such other information and in such a format relating to the Portfolio as the Issuer may reasonably request and which is in the possession of the Collateral Administrator in order for the Issuer to satisfy its obligation to make certain filings of information with the Central Bank and in respect of the preparation of its financial statements and tax returns.
Upon receipt thereof, the Collateral Administrator shall supply to Intex, Bloomberg and the Information Agent each Report and shall permit Intex Solutions, Inc. and Bloomberg L.P. to access such Reports and other data files posted on the secured website described above on which Reports are published by the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer, and the Issuer consents to such Reports and other data files being made available by Intex to its subscribers provided that Intex takes reasonable measures to ensure that such Reports and data files are accessed only by users eligible from a securities law perspective to hold Notes.
Additional Reporting Definitions

In addition, the following defined terms are incorporated into the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports:
"Assigned Moody's Rating" means the monitored publicly available rating or the estimated rating or the unpublished monitored loan rating, in each case expressly assigned to a debt obligation (or facility) by Moody's that addresses the full amount of the principal and interest promised.
"CFR" means, with respect to an obligor of a Collateral Obligation, if such obligor has a corporate family rating by Moody's, then such corporate family rating; provided, if such obligor does not have a corporate family rating by Moody's but any entity in the obligor's corporate family does have a corporate family rating, then the CFR is such corporate family rating.
The "Diversity Score" is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody's uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):
(a) an "Average Principal Balance" is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;
(b) an "Obligor Principal Balance" is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the
other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;
(c) an "Equivalent Unit Score" is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;
(d) an "Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score" is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody's industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody's from time to time);
(e) an "Industry Diversity Score" is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody's from time to time) (the "Diversity Score Table") for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table; and
(f) each of the following industrial classification groups is deemed to be "local" in Moody's opinion ("Local Industry"):
(i) Environmental Industries;
(ii) Sovereign & Public Finances;
(iii) Utilities: Electric;
(iv) Utilities: Oil & Gas; and
(v) Utilities: Water.
For the purposes of calculating the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score, where two or more Local Industries are located in different geographical regions, each such Local Industry will be treated as a separate industry.
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.

"Moody's Default Probability Rating" means, with respect to any Collateral Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then such CFR;
(b) if not determined pursuant to paragraph (a) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody's Rating, then the Assigned Moody's Rating on such obligation as selected by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion;
(c) if not determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior secured obligations with an Assigned Moody's Rating, then the Moody's rating that is one subcategory lower than the Assigned Moody's Rating on any such senior secured obligation as selected by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion;
(d) if not determined pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above, if a rating estimate has been assigned to such Collateral Obligation by Moody's upon the request of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager or an Affiliate of the Portfolio Manager, then the Moody's Default Probability Rating is such rating estimate as long as such rating estimate or a renewal for such rating estimate has been issued or provided by
Moody's in each case within the 15 month period preceding the date on which the Moody's Default Probability Rating is being determined; provided, that if such rating estimate has been issued or provided by Moody's for a period (x) longer than 12 months but not beyond 15 months, the Moody's Default Probability Rating will be one subcategory lower than such rating estimate and (y) beyond 15 months, the Moody's Default Probability Rating will be deemed to be "Caa3";
(e) if not determined pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Moody's Derived Rating; and
(f) if not determined pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody's Default Probability Rating of "Caa3".
"Moody's Derived Rating" means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation whose Moody's Rating or Moody's Default Probability Rating is determined as the Moody's Derived Rating, the rating as determined in the manner set forth below:
(a) with respect to any Corporate Rescue Loan, the Moody's Rating or Moody's Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be the rating which is one subcategory below the facility rating (whether public or private) of such Corporate Rescue Loan or Current Pay Obligation, as applicable, rated by Moody's;
(b) if not determined pursuant to paragraph (a) above, then by using any one of the methods provided below:
(i) pursuant to the table below:
Type of Collateral Obligation

(ii) or, if such Collateral Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan, no Moody's Derived Rating may be determined based on a rating by S&P or any other rating agency; provided, that the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations that may have a Moody's Rating derived from an S&P Rating as set forth in sub-paragraphs (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b) may not exceed 10 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount; and
(c) if not determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above and such Collateral Obligation is not rated by Moody's or S&P and no other security or obligation of the issuer of such Collateral Obligation is rated by Moody's or S&P, and if Moody's has been requested by the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager or the issuer of such Collateral Obligation to assign a rating or rating estimate with respect to such Collateral Obligation but such rating or rating estimate has not been received, pending receipt of such estimate, the Moody's Derived Rating of such Collateral Obligation for purposes of the definitions of Moody's Rating or Moody's Default Probability Rating shall be: (i) "B3" if the Portfolio Manager confirms to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that the Portfolio Manager believes that such estimate shall be at least "B3" and if the Collateral Principal Amount of Collateral Obligations determined pursuant to this paragraph (c) and paragraph (a) above does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount; or
(ii) otherwise, "Caa3".
"Moody's Rating" means:
(a) with respect to a Collateral Obligation that is a Secured Senior Loan or Secured Senior Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Obligation has an Assigned Moody's Rating, such Assigned Moody's Rating;
(ii) if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody's Rating but the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then the Moody's rating that is one subcategory higher than such CFR;
(iii) if neither sub-paragraph (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody's Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody's Rating, then the Moody's rating that is two subcategories higher than the Assigned Moody's Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion;
(iv) if none of sub-paragraphs (i) through (iii) above apply, at the election of the Portfolio Manager, the Moody's Derived Rating; and
(v) if none of sub-paragraphs (i) through (iv) above apply, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody's Rating of "Caa3"; and
(b) with respect to a Collateral Obligation other than a Secured Senior Loan or Secured Senior Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Obligation has an Assigned Moody's Rating, such Assigned Moody's Rating;
(ii) if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody's Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody's Rating, then the Assigned Moody's Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion;
(iii) if neither sub-paragraph (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody's Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then the Moody's rating that is one subcategory lower than such CFR;
(iv) if none of paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody's Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more subordinated debt obligations with an Assigned Moody's Rating, then the Moody's rating that is one subcategory higher than the Assigned Moody's Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Portfolio Manager in its sole discretion;
(v) if none of sub-paragraphs (i) through (iv) above apply, at the election of the Portfolio Manager, the Moody's Derived Rating; and
(vi) if none of sub-paragraphs (i) through (v) above apply, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody's Rating of "Caa3".
The "Moody's Rating Factor" relating to any Collateral Obligation is the number set forth in the table below opposite the Moody's Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Obligation.

The "Moody's Weighted Average Rating Factor" is determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation, excluding Defaulted Obligations, by its Moody's Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balances of all such Collateral Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations, and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number.
Modifications or amendments

The Portfolio Manager may, at its sole discretion, modify or amend the Moody's Weighted Average Rating Factor and/or the Diversity Score or any of the other definitions under this Additional Reporting Definitions section which affect the calculation thereof or make any modifications or amendments thereto required to reflect any changes in the methodology applied by Moody's.

The content of the Portfolio Reports and Investor Reports shall be agreed between the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager and proposed to the Collateral Administrator in writing as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the Securitisation Regulation Reporting Effective Date, taking into account the information required to be included pursuant to the EU Disclosure Requirements at such time.
TAX CONSIDERATIONS

General

Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.
POTENTIAL PURCHASERS ARE WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THEIR OWN TAX POSITION IN RESPECT OF THE NOTES. POTENTIAL PURCHASERS WHO ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THEIR TAX POSITION ON PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER OR EXERCISE OF ANY NOTE SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS. IN PARTICULAR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES WOULD BE CHARACTERISED BY ANY RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY. POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE RELEVANT FISCAL RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION MAY CHANGE, POSSIBLY WITH RETROSPECTIVE EFFECT, AND THAT THIS SUMMARY IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE. THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE OR A GUARANTEE TO ANY POTENTIAL INVESTOR OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTING IN THE NOTES.

Irish Taxation
Taxation of the Issuer

The Issuer will be taxable as a "qualifying company" pursuant to Section 110 of the TCA. Profits arising to the Issuer shall be taxable at a rate of 25 per cent. The rules applicable in order to calculate this tax are generally the same as those applicable to a regular trading company.
Where the interest on the Notes does not represent more than a reasonable commercial return on the principal outstanding and it is not dependent on the results of the company's business, the interest in respect of the Notes issued should be deductible in determining the taxable profits of the company.
However, where the interest on the Notes represents more than a reasonable commercial return on the principal outstanding or is dependent on the results of the company's business, the interest will not be deductible if:
(a) it is not reasonable to consider that the payment is made, or the security to which the payment relates was entered into, for bona fide commercial purposes and does not form part of any arrangement or scheme of which the main purpose or one of the main purposes, is the avoidance of tax; or
(b) (i) the interest is paid to a person that:
1. is not resident in Ireland and if so resident, is not otherwise within the charge to corporation tax in Ireland in respect of that interest; and
2. is not a pension fund, government body or other person resident in a "relevant territory" (as defined below) who, under the laws of that relevant territory, is exempted from tax which generally applies to profits, income or gains in that territory (except where the person is a "specified person"); and
(ii) that interest is not subject to:
(A) a tax under the laws of a "relevant territory" without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in the "relevant territory" by persons from outside the relevant territory, or
(B) Irish withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.).
The provisions at (b) above, will not apply in respect of an interest payment in respect of a quoted Eurobond (see "Withholding Tax" below) or a wholesale debt instrument within the meaning of section 246A of the TCA, except where the interest is paid to a specified person and at the time the quoted Eurobond or wholesale debt instrument was issued, the Issuer was in possession, or aware, of information, including information about any arrangement or understanding in relation to ownership of the quoted Eurobond or the wholesale debt instrument after that time,
which could reasonably be taken to indicate that interest which would be payable in respect of that quoted Eurobond or wholesale debt instrument would not be subject, without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of such interest, to a tax in a relevant territory which generally applies to profits, income or gains received in that territory, by persons, from sources outside that territory.
Where a payment is made out of the assets of the Issuer under a "return agreement" (as defined below) that is dependent on the results of the Issuer's business or any part of its business and that payment would not be deducted in computing the profits or gains of the Issuer if the payment was to be treated for the purposes of the TCA (other than section 246 thereof) as a payment of interest in respect of securities of the Issuer other than a quoted Eurobond or a wholesale debt instrument that was dependent on the results of the Issuer's business, that payment will be treated as a payment of interest for the purposes of the provisions set out at (a) or (b) above.
For the purposes of this "Irish Taxation" section, terms have the meanings as set out below: A "specified person" means:
(a) a company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer, is controlled by the Issuer, or is controlled by a third company which also directly or indirectly controls the Issuer; or
(b) a person, or persons who are connected with each other, from whom assets were acquired, or to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances, or to whom loans or advances held by the Issuer were made, or with whom the Issuer has entered into a specified agreement, where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or agreements represents not less than 75 per cent of the aggregate value of the assets of the Issuer;
and for these purposes, a person has control of a company where that person has:
(i) the power to secure-
(A) by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in or in relation to that or any other company, or
(B) by virtue of any powers conferred by the constitution, articles of association or other document regulating that or any other company,
that the affairs of the first-mentioned company are conducted in accordance with the wishes of that person, or
(ii) significant influence over the first-mentioned company and holds, directly or indirectly, more than-
(A) 20 per cent of the issued share capital of the company,
(B) 20 per cent of (i) the principal value of any securities under which the consideration given by the company for the use of the principal secured is to any extent dependent on the results of the company's business or any part of the company's business, or the consideration so given represents more than a reasonable commercial return for the use of that principal by that company, or (ii) any such securities where those securities have no principal value, or
(C) the right to 20 per cent of the interest or other distribution payable in respect of any securities issued by the company under which the consideration given by the company for the use of the principal secured is to any extent dependent on the results of the company's business or any part of the company's business, or the consideration so given represents more than a reasonable commercial return for the use of that principal by that company,
and where "significant influence" means a person with the ability to participate in the financial and operating decisions of a company.
A "specified agreement" includes any agreement, arrangement or understanding that (a) provides for the exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of one or more payments based on the value, rate or amount of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof, and (b) transfers to a person who is a party to the agreement, arrangement or understanding or to a person connected with that person, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value, rate or amount without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset (including any enterprise or investment pool) or liability that incorporates the financial risk so transferred.
A "relevant territory" is:
(a) a Member State of the European Union other than Ireland;
(b) not being such a Member State, a territory with which Ireland has a signed a double taxation agreement that is in effect; or
(c) a territory with the government of which arrangements have been made which on completion of the procedures set out in section 826(1) of the TCA will have the force of law.
A "return agreement" is a specified agreement whereby payments due under the specified agreement are dependent on the results of the Issuer's business or any part of the Issuer's business.
Deductibility of Interest by Qualifying Companies holding Specified Mortgages

As a result of changes to Section 110 of the TCA introduced in Finance Act 2016 a restriction on the deductibility of interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return on the principal outstanding or is dependent on the results of the business of the "qualifying company" can apply from 6 September 2016 to the extent that the "qualifying company" holds and/or manages one or more "specified mortgages" (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA), being, inter alia, a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land.
The Finance Act 2017 extended the interest restriction introduced in the Finance Act 2016 to profit participating or excessive interest payable on or after 19 October 2017 by a "qualifying company" which holds and/or manages shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value, directly or indirectly from Irish land. Shares that derive their value from, or the greater part of their value from, directly or indirectly, land in Ireland are to be included in the definition of "specified property business" (as defined in Section 110(5A)) to which the interest restriction can apply.
However, this restriction does not apply to the calculation of the profits arising to a "qualifying company" from, inter alia, a "CLO transaction" (as defined in Section 110 of the TCA) or activities which are preparatory thereto. A "CLO transaction" for these purposes means a securitisation transaction entered into by a "qualifying company" which is carried out in conformity with:
(a) a prospectus, within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended);
(b) listing particulars, where any securities issued by the "qualifying company" are listed on an exchange, other than the main exchange, of Ireland, or of a Member State of the European Union or the EEA (other than Ireland); or
(c) where the securities issued by the "qualifying company" will not be listed on such an exchange, legally binding documents,
that—
‎
(i) may provide for a warehousing period being a period not exceeding three years during which time the "qualifying company" is preparing to issue securities; and
(ii) provide for investment eligibility criteria that govern the type and quality of assets to be acquired,
and where, based on the documents referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) and the activities of the "qualifying company", it would not be reasonable to consider that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the "qualifying company" was to acquire "specified mortgages".
"Securitisation" is defined in Section 110 of the TCA as a securitisation within the meaning of the CRR (being Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013).
As such, if:
(a) the Issuer does not hold and/or manage "specified mortgages"; or
(b) the activities of the Issuer comprise entering into a "CLO transaction" and/or activities which are preparatory thereto,
this restriction should not apply to the calculation of the profits of the Issuer for Irish tax purposes.
Taxation of Noteholders

Persons Subject to Irish Income or Corporation Tax

In general, persons who are resident in Ireland are liable to Irish taxation on their world-wide income whereas persons who are not resident in Ireland are only liable to Irish taxation on their Irish source income. All persons are under a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.
Interest paid and discounts realised on the Notes have an Irish source and therefore interest earned and discounts realised on such Notes will be regarded as Irish source income. Accordingly, pursuant to general Irish tax rules, a non-Irish resident person in receipt of such income would be technically liable to Irish income tax (and the universal social charge if received by an individual) subject to the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty.
Ireland has currently 73 double tax treaties in effect and the majority of them exempt interest (which sometimes includes discounts) from Irish tax when received by a resident of the other jurisdiction. Credit is available for any Irish tax withheld from income on account of the related income tax liability. Non-Irish resident companies, where the income is not attributable to a branch or agency of the company in Ireland, are subject to income tax at the standard rate. Therefore any withholding tax suffered should be equal to and in satisfaction of the full income tax liability. (Non-Irish resident companies operating in Ireland through a branch or agency of the company in Ireland to which the income is attributable would be subject to Irish corporation tax).
There is an exemption from Irish income tax under Section 198 of the TCA in certain circumstances. These circumstances include:
(a) where the interest is paid by a company in the ordinary course of business carried on by it to a company
(i) which, by virtue of the law of a relevant territory, is resident in the relevant territory for the purposes of tax, and that relevant territory imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside that territory, or (ii) where the interest is either (A) exempted from the charge to income tax under arrangements made with the government of a territory outside Ireland having the force of law under procedures set out in Section 826(1) of the TCA, or (B) would be exempted from the charge to income tax if arrangements made, on or before the date of payment of the interest with the government of a territory outside Ireland that do not have force of law under procedures set out in Section 826(1) of the TCA, had the force of law when the interest was paid;
(b) where the interest is paid by a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA out of the assets of that qualifying company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory);
(c) where the interest is payable on a quoted Eurobond (see "Withholding Tax" below) and is paid by a company to a person who is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory) or to a company controlled, either directly or indirectly by a person or persons who are resident in a relevant territory and are not controlled, either directly or indirectly by persons who are not so resident; or
(d) where discounts arise to a person in respect of securities issued by a company in the ordinary course of a trade or business, where that person is resident in a relevant territory (residence to be determined under the laws of that relevant territory).
Interest on the Notes and discounts realised which do not fall within the exemptions in Section 198 of the TCA are within the charge to Irish income tax to the extent that a double tax treaty does not exempt the interest or discount as the case may be. However, it is understood that the Irish Revenue Commissioners have, in the past, operated a practice (as a consequence of the absence of a collection mechanism rather than adopted policy) whereby no action will be taken to pursue any liability to such Irish tax in respect of persons who are regarded as not being resident in Ireland except where such persons:
(i) are chargeable in the name of a person (including a trustee) or in the name of an agent or branch in Ireland having the management or control of the interest; or
(ii) seek to claim relief and/or repayment of tax deducted at source in respect of taxed income from Irish sources; or
(iii) are chargeable to Irish corporation tax on the income of an Irish branch or agency or to income tax on the profits of a trade carried on in Ireland to which the interest is attributable.
There can be no assurance that the Irish Revenue Commissioners will apply this practice in the case of the holders of Notes and, as mentioned above, there is a statutory obligation to account for Irish tax on a self-assessment basis and there is no requirement for the Irish Revenue Commissioners to issue or raise an assessment.
Withholding Tax

In general, withholding tax (unless exempted) at the current rate of 20 per cent. must be deducted from interest payments made by an Irish resident company. However, there is an exemption from withholding tax under Irish domestic law in respect of, inter alia, interest payments made by a qualifying company (within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA) to a person resident for the purposes of tax in a relevant territory except where the person is a company and the interest is received in connection with a trade carried out by that company through a branch or agency in Ireland. There is a further exemption from withholding tax under Irish domestic law in respect of interest on "quoted Eurobonds" in certain circumstances, which is expected to apply to the interest payments on the Notes.
A "quoted Eurobond" is defined as a security which:
(a) is issued by a company;
(b) is quoted on a recognised stock exchange; and
(c) carries a right to interest.
There is no obligation to withhold tax on quoted Eurobonds where:
(i) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or
(ii) the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and:
(A) either the quoted Eurobond is held in a recognised clearing system; or
(B) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made an appropriate written declaration to this effect to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland).
Encashment Tax

In certain circumstances, Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) from interest on any Note, where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.
Capital Gains Tax on Disposal of Notes

Persons who are resident in Ireland or companies which carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable and who realise a gain on the disposal of a Note may be liable to Irish taxation on capital gains at a current rate of 33 per cent. of the amount of the chargeable capital gain. In addition, any currency gain realised by such a person from a U.S. dollar denominated offering may be also liable to capital gains at a rate of 33 per cent. of the amount of the currency gain. Individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and companies that are not resident in Ireland and do not carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of Notes.
Stamp Duty

For so long as the Issuer is a "qualifying company" within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA, Irish stamp duty will not be imposed on the issue or transfer of the Notes provided the money raised by the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer's business.
Capital Acquisitions Tax

A gift or inheritance of Notes will be subject to capital acquisitions tax ("CAT") if either the disposer or the beneficiary of the Notes is resident or ordinary resident in Ireland or if any of the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland. CAT is a tax imposed primarily on the beneficiary. It is currently payable at a rate of 33 per cent. on the taxable value of the gift or inheritance subject to tax free thresholds. Gifts and inheritances between spouses are exempt from CAT.
FATCA Implementation in Ireland

On 21 December 2012, the Governments of Ireland and the United States signed an intergovernmental agreement (the "Ireland IGA" ). In July 2014, Ireland enacted Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 (the "Irish FATCA Regulations").
The Ireland IGA and Irish FATCA Regulations will increase the amount of tax information automatically exchanged between Ireland and the United States. They provide for the automatic reporting and exchange of information in relation to accounts held in Irish "financial institutions" by U.S. persons and the reciprocal exchange of information regarding U.S. financial accounts held by Irish residents.
The Issuer intends to carry on its business in such a way as to ensure that it is treated as complying with FATCA pursuant to the terms of the Ireland IGA and the Irish FATCA Regulations. The Issuer expects to be treated as a "financial institution". The Issuer shall be required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service as a "reporting financial institution" for FATCA purposes. In order for the Issuer to comply with its FATCA obligations it will be required to report certain information to the Irish Revenue Commissioners relating to Noteholders who, for FATCA purposes, are specified US persons, non-participating financial institutions or passive non-financial foreign entities ("NFFEs") that are controlled by specified US persons. Any information reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners will be communicated to the US Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the IGA. It is possible that the Irish Revenue Commissioners may also communicate this information to other tax authorities pursuant to the terms of any applicable double tax treaty, intergovernmental agreement or exchange of information regime.
The Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their FATCA status, identity or residency required by the Issuer to satisfy its FATCA obligations. Noteholders will be deemed, by their subscription for or holding of Notes to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer or any other authorised person to the relevant tax authorities.
The Issuer should not generally be subject to FATCA withholding tax in respect of its US source income for so long as it complies with its FATCA obligations. However, FATCA withholding tax may arise on US source payments to the Issuer if the Issuer does not comply with its FATCA registration and reporting obligations and the US Internal Revenue Service has specifically identified the Issuer as being a 'non-participating financial institution' for FATCA purposes. In addition, the Issuer may be unable to comply with its FATCA obligations if Noteholders do not provide the required certifications or information. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential implication of the reporting requirements imposed on the Issuer by FATCA before investing.
The Common Reporting Standard in Ireland

On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard ("CRS"). The CRS provides that certain entities (known as Financial Institutions) shall identify "Accounts" (as defined, broadly equity and debt interests in the Financial Institution) held by persons who are tax resident in another CRS participating jurisdiction. That information is then subject to annual automatic exchange between governments in CRS participating jurisdictions.
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation ("DAC II" ) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU member states ("Member States" ) to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year. Ireland has provided for the implementation of CRS through Section 891F of the TCA and the enactment of the Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 (the "CRS Regulations"). Irish Financial Institutions will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II.
The Issuer is expected to constitute a Financial Institution for CRS purposes. In order to comply with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, the Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide certain information in respect of the Noteholder's and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons' tax status, identity or residence. Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding of the Rated Notes, to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will then exchange the information with the tax or governmental authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. To the extent that the Notes are held within a recognised clearing system, the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year.
Provided the Issuer complies with these obligations, it should be deemed compliant for CRS and DAC II purposes. Failure by the Issuer to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in it being deemed to be non- compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed pursuant to the Irish implementing legislation.
U.S. Federal Income Taxation

Introduction
This is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, beneficial ownership, disposition, and retirement of the Notes. Except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular Noteholder based on such Noteholder's particular circumstances, nor does it address any aspect of state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, alternative minimum tax considerations or the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate taxes. In particular, except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to Noteholders that are subject to special treatment, including Noteholders that:
(a) are broker-dealers, securities traders, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies or grantor trusts;
(b) are certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
(c) hold Notes as part of a "straddle", "hedge", "conversion", "synthetic security", "integrated transaction" or "constructive sale" with other investments; or
(d) are partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion considers only Noteholders that will hold Notes as capital assets and does not address special tax consequences that apply to U.S. Noteholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion is generally limited to the tax consequences to initial Noteholders that purchase Notes upon their initial issue at their issue price (as defined below).
For purposes of this discussion, "U.S. Noteholder" means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
(a) a citizen or individual resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
(b) a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organised under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein;
(c) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source; or
(d) a trust, (i) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii)(A) if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust; and
(B) one or more U.S. Persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
The term "non-U.S. Noteholder" means, for purposes of this discussion, a beneficial owner of the Notes that is neither a U.S. Noteholder nor a partnership.
If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to the consequences of the acquisition, ownership, disposition and retirement of the Notes.
This discussion is based upon the Code, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, each as available and in effect as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. Furthermore, there are no cases or rulings by the IRS addressing entities similar to the Issuer or securities similar to the Notes. As a result, the IRS might disagree with all or part of the discussion below. No rulings will be requested of the IRS regarding the issues discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Notes.
Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisor concerning the application of U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the laws of any state or local taxing jurisdiction, to their particular situation.
Investors should be aware that a Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with a cash contribution in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts). Except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address the consequences to Noteholders of such cash contributions.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
United States Taxation of the Issuer
Generally. The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Trust Deed will provide that the Issuer agrees not to elect to be treated otherwise for such purposes.
United States Federal Income Taxes. The Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income (including as a result of the manner in which it acquires, holds and disposes of assets). In this regard, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP upon the issuance of the Notes, to the effect that, if the Issuer and the Portfolio Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement, including certain investment guidelines referenced therein (the "Tax Guidelines"), and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer to comply with the Tax Guidelines or the Trust Deed may not give rise to a default or an Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer to receive advice from other nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations or deviations from the Tax Guidelines will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP will assume the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the opinion
of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Issuer is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, however, there could be material adverse financial consequences to the Issuer and to persons who hold the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer's net income will not become subject to U.S. federal net income tax as a result of unanticipated activities by the Issuer, changes in law, contrary conclusions by U.S. tax authorities or other causes. In such a case, the Issuer would be potentially subject to substantial U.S. federal income tax and, in certain circumstances, interest payments by the Issuer under the Notes could be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The imposition of any of the foregoing taxes would materially affect the Issuer's ability to pay principal, interest, and other amounts owing in respect of the Notes.
Withholding and Similar Taxes. Although the Issuer does not intend to be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its net income, income derived by the Issuer may be subject to withholding or similar taxes imposed by the United States or other countries, and the imposition of such taxes could materially affect its financial ability to make payments on the Notes. In this regard and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer may generally only acquire a particular Collateral Obligation if, at the time of commitment to purchase, payments to the Issuer will not be subject to withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction (other than U.S. withholding taxes on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees), whether by virtue of an applicable double taxation treaty or otherwise, unless (i) the Obligor is required to make "gross-up" payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis or (ii) such withholding can be sheltered by the application of an applicable double tax treaty or otherwise. The Issuer may, however, be subject to withholding or similar taxes in respect of interest and disposition proceeds in respect of Collateral Obligations, and such withholding or similar taxes may not be grossed up.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that income derived by the Issuer will not become subject to withholding or similar taxes as a result of changes in law, contrary conclusions by the IRS, or other causes. In that event, such withholding or similar taxes could be applied retroactively to fees or other income previously received by the Issuer. To the extent that withholding or similar taxes are imposed and not paid through withholding, the Issuer may be directly liable to the taxing authority to pay such taxes. The imposition of unanticipated withholding or similar taxes could materially impair the Issuer's ability to make payments with respect to the Notes.
Representations. Each holder and beneficial owner of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note that is not a "United States person" (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) will make, or by acquiring such Note or an interest therein will be deemed to make, a representation to the effect that (A) either (i) it is not a bank (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code), (ii) it has provided an IRS Form W-8BEN-E representing that it is a person that is eligible for benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that eliminates U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. source interest not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States or (iii) all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and (B) it is not purchasing the Note in order to reduce its U.S. federal income tax liability pursuant to a tax avoidance plan within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.881-3.
U.S. Characterisation and U.S. Tax Treatment of the Notes
Upon the issuance of the Notes, Paul Hastings LLP will deliver an opinion generally to the effect that under current law, assuming compliance with the Transaction Documents, and based on certain assumptions and factual representations made by the Issuer and/or the Portfolio Manager, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as debt of the Issuer for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be given in respect of the Class F Notes, although the Issuer intends to treat the Class F Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Rated Note, each Noteholder of a Rated Note (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have agreed, to treat the Rated Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The determination of whether a Rated Note will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the Rated Note is issued. Prospective investors should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise as something other than indebtedness any particular Class or Classes of the Rated Notes, particularly the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes. Except as discussed below under "Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes" below, the balance of this discussion assumes that the Rated Notes of all Classes will be characterised as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees or will be deemed to agree to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
The Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that materially adversely affects the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes as described herein, including by affecting the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Notes as indebtedness or equity or changing the characterisation and timing of income inclusions to U.S. Noteholders in respect of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion and the tax opinion of Paul Hastings LLP assume that the Trust Deed is not so amended.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of Rated Notes
Payments of Interest on the Rated Notes. A U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses the cash method of accounting must include in income the U.S. dollar value of interest paid when received. Interest received in a currency other than the U.S. dollar (a "foreign currency") is translated at the U.S. dollar spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A cash method
U.S. Noteholder therefore generally will not have foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of an interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss upon disposing of the foreign currency received.
A U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses the accrual method of accounting or any U.S. Noteholder required to accrue original issue discount ("OID") will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of interest accrued during the accrual period. An accrual basis U.S. Noteholder may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest using either of two methods, in either case regardless of whether the payments are in fact converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest is translated at the average rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). An accrual method U.S. Noteholder of a Rated Note that uses this first method will therefore recognise foreign currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest paid to the extent that the exchange rate on the date the interest is received differs from the rate at which the interest income was accrued. Under the second method, the U.S. Noteholder can elect to accrue interest at the spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the partial period within the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five business days of the receipt of such interest, the spot rate on the date of receipt. An election to accrue interest at the spot rate generally will apply to all foreign currency denominated debt instruments held by the U.S. Noteholder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a U.S. Noteholder may have additional foreign currency gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the foreign currency received.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID is the excess of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of a debt instrument over its "issue price", if that excess equals or exceeds ¼ of 1 per cent. of the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity, or weighted average maturity in the case of instalment obligations (the "OID de minimis amount"). The "stated redemption price at maturity" of a debt instrument such as the Rated Notes is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Rated Note other than "qualified stated interest" payments. The "issue price" of a Rated Note generally is the first offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt instrument is sold. The term "qualified stated interest" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain conditions discussed below, at a variable rate.
Prospective U.S. Noteholders should note that to the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (together the "Deferrable Notes") are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes. Consequently, such interest is not unconditionally payable in cash or property at least annually and will not be treated as "qualified stated interest". Therefore, all of the stated interest payments on each of the Deferrable Notes, will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity of such Notes, and as a result the Deferrable Notes will be treated as issued with OID.
It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID, such as the provisions of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code (debt instruments that may be accelerated by reason of the prepayment of other debt obligations securing such debt instruments) are applicable to the Rated Notes that are treated as issued with OID. Special tax rules principally relating to the accrual of OID, market discount, and bond premium apply to debt instruments described in Section 1272(a)(6). Further, those debt
instruments may not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as part of an integrated transaction with a related hedge under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-6. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effects of Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code.
If a U.S. Noteholder holds a Rated Note with OID (an "OID Note") such U.S. Noteholder may be required to include OID in income before receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Noteholder's accounting method for tax purposes. If the U.S. Noteholder is an initial purchaser of an OID Note, the amount of the OID includible in income is the sum of the daily accruals of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which such U.S. Noteholder held the OID Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the OID Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between: (a) the product of the "adjusted issue price" of the OID Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period); and (b) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The "adjusted issue price" of an OID Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the OID Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments the U.S. Noteholder received on the OID Note that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, the U.S. Noteholder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.
Each class of Rated Notes will be "variable rate debt instruments" if such class of Rated Notes (a) has an issue price that does not exceed the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes by more than an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 0.015 multiplied by the product of such total non-contingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity of such class of Rated Notes; and (ii) 15 per cent. of the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes; (b) provides for stated interest (compounded or paid at least annually) at the current value of one or more qualified floating rates, including the EURIBOR rate, on such class of Rated Notes; and (c) does not provide for any principal payments that are contingent. The Rated Notes will qualify as variable rate debt instruments, provided the issue price is not more than 115,000 Euro per 100,000 Euro principal amount. Interest payments on certain "variable rate debt instruments" may be considered qualified stated interest.
If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument will be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. Thus, if any class of the Rated Notes does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, a U.S. Noteholder would be required to report income in respect of such Notes in accordance with U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments, which generally require a U.S. Noteholder to accrue interest on a constant yield basis based on a projected payment schedule determined by the Issuer. The contingent payment debt instrument rules are complex and investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the potential taxation of the Notes under the contingent payment debt instrument rules.
The OID rules are complex. Moreover, a U.S. Noteholder that uses the accrual method of accounting generally will be required to include certain amounts in ordinary income no later than the taxable year in which the U.S. Noteholder takes such amounts into account as revenue in an "applicable financial statement". The application of this rule thus may require the accrual of income earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described above; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations generally exclude OID from this new rule. U.S. Noteholders are permitted to rely on the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations with respect to the Notes, provided that any such
U.S. Noteholder applies all of the applicable rules contained in the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations consistently to all items of income during such U.S. Noteholder's taxable year. U.S. Noteholders that use an accrual method of accounting should consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situation.
Interest on the Notes received by a U.S. Noteholder will generally be treated as foreign source "passive income" for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, or, in certain cases, "general category income".
Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Repayment of the Rated Notes. Unless a non-recognition provision applies, a U.S. Noteholder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale, exchange, repayment or other disposition of a Rated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised plus the fair market value of any property received on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and the U.S. Noteholder's adjusted tax basis in such Rated Note.
The amount realised on the sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note generally is determined by translating the proceeds into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note is disposed of, while a U.S. Noteholder's adjusted tax basis in a Rated Note generally will be the cost of the Rated Note to the U.S. Noteholder, determined by translating the purchase price into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note was purchased, and increased by the amount of any OID accrued and reduced by any payments other than payments of qualified stated interest of such Note. If, however, the Rated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Noteholder or electing accrual basis U.S. Noteholder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date. An election by an accrual basis U.S. Noteholder to apply the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will be subject to the rules regarding currency translation elections described above, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss realised with respect to accrued but unpaid interest is the difference between the U.S. Dollar value of the interest based on the spot exchange rate on the date the Rated Notes are disposed of and the U.S. Dollar value at which the interest was previously accrued.
Foreign currency gain or loss recognised by a U.S. Noteholder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Rated Note (including repayment at maturity) generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency gain or loss on a Rated Note generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Noteholder, preferential rates may apply to any capital gain if such U.S. Noteholder's holding period for such Rated Notes exceeds one year.
Receipt of Foreign Currency.

U.S. Noteholders will have a tax basis in any foreign currency received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of such foreign currency generally will be ordinary income or loss and will be recognised only to the extent of total gain or loss on the transaction. A U.S. Noteholder that converts the foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Base Rate Amendment

The Issuer may enter into one or more supplemental trust deeds or another modification to change the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes to an alternative Rate of Interest (such change, a "Base Rate Amendment"). It is possible that a Base Rate Amendment will be treated as a deemed exchange of old notes for new notes, which may be taxable to U.S. Noteholders. Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, a change in the reference rate from LIBOR or EURIBOR to a "qualified rate" as defined in such proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations generally will not be treated as a modification of a Floating Rate Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations may be relied upon by a taxpayer if the taxpayer and its related parties consistently apply the rules in the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations. If a Base Rate Amendment was classified as a modification, and such modification were treated as a "significant modification" for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which would generally occur if such Base Rate Amendment causes a change in the yield of a Floating Rate Note by more than the greater of (x) 0.25 per cent. or (y) 5.0 per cent. of the annual yield of the Note prior to the Base Rate Amendment), then unless the Base Rate Amendment is treated as a tax-free "recapitalization" for U.S. federal income tax purpose or another exception exists at the time of the Base Rate Amendment, the Base Rate Amendment could cause a U.S. Noteholder of a Floating Rate Note to recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair market value of the modified Floating Rate Note (if the Floating Rate Note is treated as publicly traded) or its principal amount (if the Floating Rate Note is not treated as publicly traded), in each case not including any accrued but unpaid interest (which will be taxable as such) and (ii) the holder's tax basis in the Floating Rate Note. Any gain will be long- term capital gain if the Floating Rate Note was held for more than one year at the time of the Base Rate Amendment, or otherwise short-term capital gain. The tax on any such gain may exceed the after-tax distributions on the Note during the taxable year in which the Base Rate Amendment occurs, in which case the U.S. Noteholder would be required to fund its tax liability in respect of the gain from other sources. In the event that a Base Rate Amendment is treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. Noteholder's holding period in respect of the modified Floating Rate Note will begin on the day following the modification. U.S. Noteholders may not be permitted to recognize loss upon a Base Rate Amendment. In addition, a Base Rate Amendment could create or change the amount of any OID that U.S. Noteholders are required to include with respect to their Floating Rate Notes. Finally, in the event that the issue price of the Class of deemed new Floating Rate Notes is less than the principal amount of such Floating Rate Notes, the Issuer may be required to recognize cancellation of indebtedness income. This may result in adverse consequences for the Subordinated Notes. For
example, a U.S. Noteholder of a Subordinated Note may be required to include its pro rata share of the Issuer's cancellation of indebtedness income if such holder has in effect a QEF election (as discussed and defined below) or, in certain circumstances, if the U.S. Noteholder owns (directly, indirectly, or by attribution) at least 10.0 per cent. of the combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Issuer. U.S. Noteholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the potential consequences of a Base Rate Amendment.
Alternative Characterisation of the Rated Notes.
It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as "contingent payment debt instruments" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Noteholder's OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
As described above the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. dollar value of gain on the sale of the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and the U.S. dollar value of certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Noteholder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Noteholder's ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a QEF and so electing at the appropriate time. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity, a U.S. Noteholder will also be required to file an annual PFIC report. The Issuer will provide, upon such U.S. Noteholder's request and at the Issuer's expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Noteholder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to make and maintain a "protective" QEF election.
Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a CFC, and a
U.S. Noteholder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Noteholder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under "U.S. Tax Treatment of
U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes" with respect to its Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
If the Issuer holds any Collateral Obligations that are treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, U.S. Noteholders of Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Noteholder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Noteholder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Noteholders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Noteholder would be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Noteholder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Noteholder's purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000.
U.S. Noteholders may wish to file a "protective" IRS Form 926 with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
Finally, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer, a U.S. Noteholder of such Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the IRS if the U.S. Noteholder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if the U.S. Noteholder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Noteholders may wish to file a "protective" IRS Form 5471 with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
Prospective U.S. Noteholders of Class E Notes and Class F Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding whether to make protective filings of IRS Forms 8621, 926 and 5471 with respect to such Notes and the consequences to them if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
U.S. Tax Treatment of U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes
The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Subordinated Note, each Noteholder of a Subordinated Note will be deemed to have agreed, to treat all Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by any governmental authority. The balance of this discussion assumes that the Subordinated Notes will properly be characterised as equity in the Issuer. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of the Subordinated Notes.
Amounts contributed to the Issuer in accordance with Condition 3(e) (Reinvestment Amounts) that otherwise would have been distributed on the Notes will be deemed (for federal income tax purposes) paid to the contributing Noteholder and then contributed to the Issuer. In addition, any such contribution may be treated as equity in the Issuer and could affect the allocation of income to all of the Subordinated Notes under the QEF and CFC rules discussed below. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the federal income tax treatment of any such contribution (including the likelihood that such contribution will be treated as an equity interest in the Issuer).
Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company. A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for
U.S. federal income tax purposes if 75 per cent. or more of its gross income (including the pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which the non-U.S. corporation is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) in a taxable year is passive income. Alternatively, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC if at least 50 per cent. of its assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based on fair market value (including the pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which the Issuer is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) are held for the production of, or produce, passive income.
Based on the assets that the Issuer expects to hold and the income anticipated thereon, it is highly likely that the Issuer will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the following discussion assumes that the Issuer will be a PFIC throughout the term of the Subordinated Notes, and U.S. Noteholders of Subordinated Notes should assume that they will be subject to the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below that result from owning stock in a PFIC (subject to the discussion below under "Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation").
Unless a U.S. Noteholder elects to treat the Issuer as a QEF (as described in the next paragraph), upon certain distributions ("excess distributions") by the Issuer and upon a disposition of the Subordinated Notes at a gain, the
U.S. Noteholder will be liable to pay tax at the highest tax rate on ordinary income in effect for each period to which the income is allocated plus interest on the tax, as if such distributions and gain had been recognised rateably over the U.S. Noteholder's holding period for the Subordinated Notes. An interest charge is also applied to the deferred tax amount resulting from the deemed rateable distribution.
If a U.S. Noteholder elects to treat the Issuer as a QEF, distributions and gain will not be taxed as if recognised rateably over the U.S. Noteholder's holding period or subject to an interest charge. Instead, a U.S. Noteholder that makes a QEF election is required for each taxable year to include in income the U.S. Noteholder's pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of the QEF as ordinary income and a pro rata share of the net capital gain of the QEF as capital gain, regardless of whether such earnings or gain have in fact been distributed (assuming the discussion below under "Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation" does not apply), and subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes, which deferral is subject to an interest charge. Consequently, in order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Noteholder must receive from the Issuer certain information ("QEF Information"). The Issuer will provide, or cause its independent accountants to provide, U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes, upon reasonable request by such U.S. Noteholder with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Noteholder would need to make a QEF election. Except as expressly noted, the discussion below assumes that a QEF election will not be made.
Where a QEF election is not timely made by a U.S. Noteholder for the year in which it acquired its Subordinated Notes (or any other Class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes), but is made for a later year, the excess distribution rules can be avoided for such later year and subsequent years by making an election to recognise gain from a deemed sale of such Notes at the time when the QEF election becomes effective.
If the Issuer is a PFIC, each U.S. Noteholder of a Subordinated Note must make an annual return on IRS Form 8621, reporting distributions received and gains realised with respect to each PFIC in which the U.S. Noteholder holds a direct or indirect interest. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules. If a U.S. Noteholder does not file Form 8621, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes of such U.S. Noteholder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules.
Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation. Depending on the degree of ownership of the Subordinated Notes and other equity interests in the Issuer by U.S. Noteholders and whether the Subordinated Notes are treated as voting securities, the Issuer may constitute a CFC. In general, a foreign corporation will constitute a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned, directly or indirectly, by "U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholders". A "U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder", for this purpose, is any U.S. person that owns or is treated as owning under specified attribution rules, 10 per cent. or more of all classes of shares of a non-U.S. corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value. If more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes (and any Rated Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes), determined with respect to aggregate value or aggregate outstanding principal amount, are owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by such U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholders, the Issuer will be treated as a CFC. Due to the application of certain constructive ownership rules (among other factors), it is possible that the Issuer may not have access to sufficient information to determine whether it is a CFC for any taxable year.
If the Issuer were treated as a CFC at any period during a taxable year, a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer would be treated, subject to certain exceptions, as receiving a dividend at the end of the taxable year of the Issuer in an amount equal to that person's pro rata share of the "subpart F income" and investments in U.S. property of the Issuer. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, "subpart F income" includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, substantially all of its income would be subpart F income. In addition, special rules apply to determine the appropriate exchange rate to be used to translate such amounts treated as a dividend and the amount of any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to distributions of previously taxed amounts attributable to movements in exchange rates between the times of deemed and actual distributions and certain "dividends" from such CFC could be recharacterised as U.S. source income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion below assumes that the Issuer is not a CFC. U.S. Noteholders should consult their tax advisors regarding these special rules.
If the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, for the period during which a U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes is a
U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer, such Noteholder generally would be taxable on the subpart F income and investments in U.S. property of the Issuer under rules described in the preceding paragraph and not under the PFIC rules previously described. A U.S. Noteholder that is a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer subject to the CFC rules for only a portion of the time during which it holds Subordinated Notes should consult its own tax advisor regarding the interaction of the PFIC and CFC rules.
If the Issuer is a CFC, the Issuer intends to supply U.S. Noteholders of the Subordinated Notes with the information needed for such U.S. Noteholders to comply with the CFC rules.
Distributions on the Subordinated Notes. Except to the extent that distributions are attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules or a QEF election is made, some or all of any distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes may constitute excess distributions, taxable as previously described. Distributions of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer which are not excess distributions will be taxed as dividends when received. The amount of such income is determined by translating the foreign currency received into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt. A U.S. Noteholder may realise foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the foreign currency received.
Disposition of the Subordinated Notes. In general, a U.S. Noteholder of a Subordinated Note will recognise gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of the Subordinated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised and such Noteholder's adjusted tax basis in such Subordinated Note. Initially, the tax basis of a U.S. Noteholder should equal the amount paid for a Subordinated Note. Such basis will be increased by amounts taxable to such Noteholder by virtue of the QEF or CFC rules (if applicable), and decreased by actual distributions from the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a non-taxable return of capital. A
U.S. Noteholder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes
generally will realise an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale. A U.S. Noteholder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. Dollar amount realised. Any gain or loss realised by a U.S. Noteholder on a subsequent conversion of the foreign currency for a different amount will be foreign currency gain or loss. If, however, the Subordinated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Noteholder or electing accrual basis U.S. Noteholder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date.
Unless a QEF election is made, it is highly likely that any gain realised on the sale or exchange of a Subordinated Note will be treated as an excess distribution and taxed as ordinary income under the special tax rules described above (assuming that the PFIC rules apply and not the CFC rules).
Subject to a special limitation for individual U.S. Noteholders that have held the Subordinated Notes for more than one year, if the Issuer were treated as a CFC and a U.S. Noteholder were treated as a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder therein, then any gain realised by such Noteholder upon the disposition of Subordinated Notes would be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Noteholder's pro rata share of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer and any of its subsidiaries. In this respect, earnings and profits would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules.
Foreign Currency Gain or Loss. A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or other Notes treated as equity interests in the Issuer) that recognises income from the Subordinated Notes under the QEF or CFC rules discussed above will recognise foreign currency gain or loss attributable to movement in foreign exchange rates between the date when it recognised income under those rules and the date when the income actually is distributed. Any such foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss from the same source as the associated income inclusion.
A U.S. Noteholder that purchases Subordinated Notes with previously owned foreign currency generally will recognise foreign currency gain or loss in an amount equal to any difference between the U.S. Noteholder's tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency at the spot rate on the date the Notes are purchased. A U.S. Noteholder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes generally will realise an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale. A U.S. Noteholder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. dollar amount realised. Any gain or loss realised by a U.S. Noteholder on a subsequent conversion of the foreign currency for a different amount will be foreign currency gain or loss.
Transfer and Other Reporting Requirements
In general, U.S. Noteholders who acquire Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that is recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) for cash may be required to file a Form 926 with the IRS and to supply certain additional information to the IRS if (i) such U.S. Noteholder owns (directly or indirectly) immediately after the transfer, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the transfer when aggregated with all related transfers under applicable regulations, exceeds U.S.$100,000.
In addition, a U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that is recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) that owns (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer (and each officer or director of the Issuer that is a U.S. citizen or resident) may be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471. A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes generally is required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it owns (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer.
Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes or other interest that could be recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) should consult with their own tax advisors regarding whether they are required to file IRS Form 8886 in respect of this transaction. Such filing generally will be required if such investors file U.S. federal income tax returns or U.S. federal information returns and recognise losses in excess of a specified threshold. Such filing will also generally be required by a U.S. Noteholder of the Subordinated Notes if the Issuer both participates in certain types of transactions that are treated as "reportable transactions," such as a transaction in which its loss exceeds a specified threshold, and either (x) such U.S. Noteholder owns 10 per cent. or more of the aggregate amount of the Subordinated Notes and makes a QEF Election with respect to the Issuer or (y) the Issuer is treated as a CFC and such U.S. Noteholder is a "U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder" (as defined above) of the Issuer. If the Issuer does participate in a reportable transaction and a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes requests information relating to such transaction, the Issuer will make reasonable efforts to provide such information as soon as practicable (such information to be provided at the Issuer's expense).
Certain U.S. Noteholders will be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold them in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other "specified foreign financial assets" exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or exceeds $75,000 at any time during the tax year. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Noteholder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.
A U.S. Noteholder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Noteholder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer's outstanding equity.
U.S. Noteholders that fail to comply with applicable reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a "tolling" of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns and in some cases significant penalties. U.S. Noteholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these and any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Notes.
U.S. Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Noteholders of Notes
Subject to the discussions below under "Information Reporting and Backup Withholding", payments, including interest, OID and any amounts treated as dividends, on a Note to a non-U.S. Noteholder and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note by a non-U.S. Noteholder, will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless (a) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such non-
U.S. Noteholder in the United States; or (b) in the case of federal income tax imposed on gain, such non-U.S. Noteholder is a non-resident alien individual who holds a Note as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
The amount of interest and principal paid or accrued on the Notes, and the proceeds from the sale of a Note, in each case, paid within the United States or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman to a U.S. person (other than a corporation or other exempt recipient) will be reported to the IRS. Under the Code, a U.S. person may be subject, under certain circumstances, to "backup withholding tax" with respect to interest and principal on a Note or the gross proceeds from the sale of a Note paid within the United States or by a U.S. middleman or United States payor to a U.S. Person. Backup withholding tax generally applies only if the U.S. person: (a) fails to furnish its social security or other taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after the request therefore; (b) furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (c) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report interest OID or dividends; or (d) fails, under certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding tax for failure to report interest and dividend payments.
Non-U.S. Noteholders or, in certain cases, their beneficial owners may be required to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. Noteholders in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding tax.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding collected from a payment will be allowed as a credit against the recipient's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the recipient to a refund, so long as the required information is properly furnished to the IRS. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers about any additional reporting requirements that may arise as a result of their purchasing, holding or disposing of Notes.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER'S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Pursuant to FATCA, a "foreign financial institution" may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes ("foreign passthru payments") to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer expects to be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. Additionally under existing U.S.
Treasury Regulations, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of U.S. Collateral Obligations was to take effect on 1 January 2019; however, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, which may be currently relied upon, would eliminate FATCA withholding on such types of payments. A number of jurisdictions (including Ireland) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA ("IGAs"), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to two years after the date on which final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining "foreign passthru payments" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register and Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining "foreign passthru payments" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be "grandfathered" for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified after such date. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.
Each Noteholder may be required to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and its owners (or beneficial owners) in order to enable the Issuer (or an Intermediary) to identify and report on the Noteholder and certain of the Noteholder's direct and indirect U.S. beneficial owners to the IRS or a Dutch authority. Further, the Noteholder will be required to permit the Issuer to share such information with the relevant taxing authority. Although certain exceptions to these disclosure requirements could apply, each Noteholder should assume that if it fails to provide the required information or otherwise prevents the Issuer from complying with FATCA, the Issuer generally have the right to force the sale of the Noteholder's Notes (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value).
FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form.
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
ERISA imposes certain requirements on "employee benefit plans" subject thereto, on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, "ERISA Plans"), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, "Plans" ) and certain persons (referred to as "parties in interest" under ERISA or "disqualified persons" under the Code (collectively, "Parties in Interest")) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, and applicable guidance (the "Plan Asset Regulation" )), if a Plan invests in an "equity interest" of an entity that is neither a "publicly offered security" nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan's assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an "operating company," as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets (direct or indirect) of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Portfolio Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a "Controlling Person"), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the "25 per cent. Limitation"). A "Benefit Plan Investor" means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan or plan's investment in such entity.
If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries, Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an "equity interest" as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and, to a greater extent, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may be considered "equity interests" for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors and Controlling Persons in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations
made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class) at all times (excluding, for purposes of such calculation, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under "Transfer Restrictions" below. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with the 25 per cent. Limitation.
Each of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, a Portfolio Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more, Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, a Portfolio Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).
Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE" ) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent "qualified professional asset managers"), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain "in-house asset managers"). There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.
It should be noted that an insurance company's general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company's ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.
Each purchaser and transferee of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes or any interest in such Notes will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) either (A) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Notes or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code ("Other Plan Law" ), and no part of the assets to be used by it to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or such governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, or (B) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law, and (ii) it will not sell or transfer such Notes (or interest therein) to a transferee acquiring such Notes (or interest therein) unless the transferee makes the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements described in clause (i) hereof.
Each initial investor and each transferee of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes shall be required or deemed to represent, warrant and agree (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, (and for so long as it holds such Note or an interest therein will not be and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, an investor that is or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person may acquire such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or any interest therein) if such transferee; (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and (iii) either (A) acquires such interest in the form of a Definitive Certificate or (B) is a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person that purchases the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate on the Issue Date or that is the Originator. A governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan acquiring Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be required or deemed to represent that: (1) for so long as it holds such Notes or interest therein, it will not be subject to any federal, state, local, non-
U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interests and thereby subject the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer's assets) to any Other Plan Law ("Similar Law") and (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or interests therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law. Each holder of a Class E Note, a Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will agree, or be deemed to agree, to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Note.
No proposed purchase or transfer of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein), in any form, will be permitted or recognised if a purchase or transfer to a transferee will cause the 25 per cent. Limitation described above to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by each class).
If the purchaser or transferee of any Notes or beneficial interests therein is a Benefit Plan Investor, it will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Portfolio Manager, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided any investment advice within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA to the Benefit Plan Investor, or to any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor ("Fiduciary"), in connection with its acquisition of Notes, and
(ii) the Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgement in evaluating the investment in the Notes.
Any Plan fiduciary considering whether to acquire a Note on behalf of a Plan or an employee benefit plan whether or not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, should consult with its counsel regarding the potential consequences of such investment, the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and/or provisions of Similar Law or Other Plan Law, and the scope of any available exemption relating to such investment.
The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person, that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by such plans in general or any particular plan, or that this investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (in its capacity as initial purchaser, the "Initial Purchaser") has agreed with the Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to subscribe and pay for the Notes pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreement entitles the Initial Purchaser to terminate it in certain circumstances prior to payment being made to the Issuer.
The Originator has agreed with the Initial Purchaser, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to purchase the Retention Notes on the Issue Date from the Initial Purchaser at their respective issue prices set out herein.
The Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and may be different from the issue price of the Notes.
It is a condition of the issue of the Notes of each Class that the Notes of each other Class be issued in the following principal amounts: Class A Notes: €145,000,000, Class B-1 Notes: €13,000,000, Class B-2 Notes: €12,500,000, Class C Notes: €20,500,000, Class D Notes: €14,000,000, Class E Notes: €10,500,000, Class F Notes: €5,000,000, Subordinated Notes: €31,000,000.
The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager, the Agents, the Trustee and certain other participants against certain liabilities or to contribute to payments they may be required to make in respect thereof.
Certain of the Collateral Obligations may have been originally underwritten or placed by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates. In addition, the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may have in the past performed and may in the future perform investment banking services or other services for issuers of the Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may from time to time as a principal or through one or more investment funds that it or they manage, make investments in the equity securities of one or more of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations, with a result that one or more of such issuers may be or may become controlled by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments (including the Notes) of the Issuer. The Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
No action has been or will be taken by the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Portfolio Manager or the Originator that would permit a public offering of the Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material in relation to the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required other than the application and the approval of this Offering Circular with and by Euronext Dublin. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or from any jurisdiction, except in circumstances which will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser.
United States

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. Persons or to "U.S. residents" (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) except in certain transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in the manner so as not to require the registration of the Issuer as an "investment company" pursuant to the Investment Company Act.
The Issuer has been advised that the Initial Purchaser proposes to resell the Notes (a) outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in "offshore transactions" in reliance on Regulation S and in accordance with applicable law and (b) in the United States (directly or through its U.S. broker dealer Affiliate) in reliance on Rule 144A only to or for the accounts of QIBs, provided that each of such purchasers or accountholders is also a QP. The Initial Purchaser and/or its Affiliates may retain a certain proportion of the Notes in their portfolios with an intention to hold to maturity or to trade. The holding or any sale of the Notes by these parties may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and may also affect the prices of the Notes in the primary or secondary market.
The Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A for each Class of Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
€250,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any offer or sale of Rule 144A Notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. After the Notes are released for sale, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchaser.
The Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver any Regulation S Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident as part of their distribution at any time and that it will send to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration to which it sells Regulation S Notes a confirmation or other notice setting forth the prohibition on offers and sales of the Regulation S Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.
This Offering Circular has been prepared by the Issuer for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes and for the listing of the Notes of each Class on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin. The Issuer and the Initial Purchaser reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase, in whole or in part, for any reason, or to sell less than the principal amount of Notes which may be offered. This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to any person within the United States or to any U.S. Person. Distribution of this Offering Circular to any such person, other than in accordance with the procedures described above, is unauthorised and any disclosure of any of its contents, without the prior written consent of the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser, is prohibited.

(12) Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.
(13) The purchaser will acknowledge and agree, among other things, that it understands that the Issuer is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, that the Issuer intends to rely on an exception contained in Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, and that Section 3(c)(7) excepts from the definition of "investment company" those issuers that privately place their securities solely to, and whose securities are held solely by, persons who at the time of purchase are "qualified purchasers" or entities owned exclusively by "qualified purchasers".
(14) The purchaser will treat the Issuer and the Notes as described in the "Tax Considerations - U.S. Federal Income Taxation" section of the Offering Circular for all U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes and will take no action inconsistent with such treatment unless required by law.

The purchaser acknowledges that the failure to provide, update or replace any such tax forms or certificates may result in the imposition of withholding or back-up withholding upon payments to the purchaser, or to the Issuer. Amounts withheld from payments to the purchaser by the Issuer or its agents that are, in their sole judgement, required to be withheld pursuant to applicable tax laws will be treated as having been paid to the purchaser by the Issuer.

In the event the purchaser fails to provide such information or take such actions, or to the extent that its ownership of Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to any tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer (and any agent acting on its behalf) is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the purchaser as compensation for any amounts withheld from payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or such ownership, the Issuer will have the right to compel the purchaser to sell its Notes and, if such purchaser does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or its agents, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to such person as payment in full for such Notes.

The purchaser agrees that the Issuer, the Trustee or their agents or representatives may (1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and any
other relevant tax authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Issuer complies with FATCA and the CRS.

(c) it has provided an IRS Form W-8ECI representing that all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and includible in its gross income.

(19) No purchaser of Subordinated Notes will treat any income with respect to its Subordinated Notes as derived in connection with the Issuer's active conduct of a banking, financing, insurance, or other similar business for purposes of Section 954(h)(2) of the Code.
(20) No purchase or transfer of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be recorded or otherwise recognised unless the purchaser or transferee has provided the Issuer with an ERISA certificate substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) hereto.
(21) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Portfolio Manager, the Originator and the Collateral Administrator and their Affiliates, and others, will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements.

For the purposes of the above:
"S&P Recovery Rate" means in respect of each Collateral Obligation and each Class of Rated Notes the recovery rate determined in accordance with the Portfolio Management and Administration Agreement or advised by S&P; and
"S&P Recovery Rating" means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation for which an S&P Recovery Rate is being determined, the "Recovery Rating" assigned by S&P to such Collateral Obligation based upon the tables set forth in this Annex A (S&P Recovery Rates).
ANNEX B
FORM OF ERISA CERTIFICATE
The purpose of this ERISA certificate (this "Certificate") is, among other things, to (i) endeavour to ensure that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] and the [Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by each class) issued by OCP Euro CLO 2020-4 Designated Activity Company (the "Issuer") is held by (a) an employee benefit plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (b) a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or (c) any entity whose underlying assets include "plan assets" by reason of any such employee benefit plan or plan's investment in the entity (collectively, "Benefit Plan Investors"), (ii) obtain from you certain representations and agreements and
(iii) provide you with certain related information with respect to your acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] and the [Subordinated Notes]. By signing this Certificate, you agree to be bound by its terms.
Please be aware that the information contained in this Certificate is not intended to constitute advice and the examples given below are not intended to be, and are not, comprehensive. You should contact your own counsel if you have any questions in completing this Certificate. Capitalised terms not defined in this Certificate shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Trust Deed.
If a box is not checked, you are representing, warranting and agreeing that the applicable Section does not, and will not, apply to you.
(1) Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA or the Code. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code.
Examples: (i) tax qualified retirement plans such as pension, profit sharing and Section 401(k) plans,
(ii) welfare benefit plans such as accident, life and medical plans, (iii) individual retirement accounts or "IRAs" and "Keogh" plans and (iv) certain tax-qualified educational and savings trusts.
(2) Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include "plan assets" by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor's investment in such entity.
Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and (iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the total value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.
If you check Box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute "plan assets" for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code: per cent.
AN ENTITY OR FUND THAT CANNOT PROVIDE THE FOREGOING PERCENTAGE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS OWN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT. OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE [CLASS E NOTES], THE [CLASS F NOTES] AND THE [SUBORDINATED NOTES], 100 PER CENT. OF THE ASSETS OF THE ENTITY OR FUND WILL BE TREATED AS "PLAN ASSETS."
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section (2), you should consult with your counsel.
(3) Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company's corporate investment portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute "plan assets" for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the "Plan Asset Regulations").
If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute "plan assets" for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent. test under the Plan Asset Regulations: per cent. IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERCENTAGE IN THE BLANK SPACE, YOU WILL BE COUNTED AS IF YOU FILLED IN 100 PER CENT. IN THE BLANK SPACE.
(4) None of Sections (1) Through (3) Above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer of such change.
(5) No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) through (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] (or interests therein) do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
(6) Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-
U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Portfolio Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer's assets) to laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] (or interests therein) do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
(7) Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Portfolio Manager, (ii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (iv) any "affiliate" of any of the above persons. "Affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a "Controlling Person."
Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by each class), the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.
(8) Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:
(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer shall, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder within 10 days after the date of such notice;
(ii) if we fail to transfer our [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes], the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes] or our interest in the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;
(iii) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes] and selling such securities to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;
(iv) by our acceptance of an interest in the [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes], we agree to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers;
(v) the proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale, shall be remitted to us; and
(vi) the terms and conditions of any sale under this sub-section shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to us as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
(9) Required Notification and Agreement. We hereby agree that we (a) will inform the Issuer of any proposed transfer by us of all or a specified portion of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] and (b) will not initiate any such transfer after we have been informed by the Issuer in writing that such transfer would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded. We hereby agree and acknowledge that after the Issuer effects any permitted transfer of [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes] owned by us to a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person or receives notice of any such permitted change of status, the Issuer shall include such [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes] in future calculations of the 25 per cent. Limitation made pursuant hereto unless subsequently notified that such [Class E Notes], [Class F Notes] or [Subordinated Notes] (or such portion), as applicable, would no longer be deemed to be held by Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons.
(10) Continuing Representation; Reliance. We acknowledge and agree that the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Certificate shall be deemed made on each day from the date we make such representations, warranties and agreements through and including the date on which we dispose of our interests in the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes]. We understand and agree that the information supplied in this Certificate will be used and relied upon by the Issuer to determine that Benefit Plan Investors own or hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by class) upon any subsequent transfer of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] in accordance with the Trust Deed.
(11) Further Acknowledgement and Agreement. We acknowledge and agree that (i) all of the representations, warranties, agreements and assurances contained in this Certificate are for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and the Portfolio Manager as third party beneficiaries hereof, (ii) copies of this Certificate and any information contained herein may be provided to the Issuer, the Trustee, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, the Portfolio Manager, any Portfolio Manager Related Person, Affiliates of any of the foregoing parties and to each of the foregoing parties' respective counsel for purposes of making the determinations described above and (iii) any acquisition or transfer of the [Class E Notes], the [Class F Notes] or the [Subordinated Notes] by us that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate shall be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.
(12) Future Transfer Requirements.
Transferee Letter and its Delivery. We acknowledge and agree that a transferee of a [Class E Note], [Class F Note] or a [Subordinated Note] (or any interest therein) from us will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person, unless such a transferee is a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person and (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and (iii) either (A) acquires such Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate, or (B) is the Originator and acquires such a Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate

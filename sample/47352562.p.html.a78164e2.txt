The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes (such Classes of Notes, the “Rated Notes”) together with the Subordinated Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Notes”. The Notes will be issued and secured pursuant to a trust deed (the “Trust Deed”) dated 27 February 2014 (the “Issue Date”), made between (amongst others) the Issuer and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, in its capacity as trustee (the “Trustee”).

This Offering Circular does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of Article 5 of Directive 2003/71/EC (as such directive may be amended from time to time, the “Prospectus Directive”). The Issuer is not offering the Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances that would require a prospectus to be prepared pursuant to the Prospectus Directive. Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the official list (the “Official List”) and trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange (the “Global Exchange Market”). There can be no assurance that any such approval will be granted or, if granted, that such listing will be maintained. Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange to approve this Offering Circular. This Offering Circular constitutes listing particulars for the purpose of this application.
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer which are payable solely out of amounts received by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Collateral (as defined herein). The net proceeds of the realisation of the security over the Collateral upon acceleration of the Notes following an Event of Default (as defined herein) may be insufficient to pay all amounts due to the Noteholders (as defined herein) after making payments to other creditors of the Issuer ranking prior thereto or pari passu therewith. In the event that there is a shortfall in such proceeds, the
Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets (including the Issuer Dutch Account and the rights of the Issuer under the Issuer Management Agreement (each as defined herein)) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall, all claims in respect of which shall be extinguished. See Condition 4 (Security).

THE ISSUER WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. INTERESTS IN THE NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER, AND EACH PURCHASER OF NOTES OFFERED HEREBY IN MAKING ITS PURCHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OR DEEMED TO HAVE MADE CERTAIN ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS. SEE “PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION” AND “TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS”.

Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the Retention Requirements or is an Affected Investor (as defined in “Risk Factors – Risk retention” below) should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain.

The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). Rule 144A Notes of each Class will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”) or in some cases definitive certificates (each a “Rule 144A Definitive Certificate” and together the “Rule 144A Definitive Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Regulation S Notes of each Class (the “Regulation S Notes”) sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”), or in some cases by definitive certificates of such Class (each a “Regulation S Definitive Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Definitive Certificates”) in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”) or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof.

Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Notes in definitive certificated form will be issued in the case of the Retention Notes and otherwise only in limited circumstances.

See “Form of the Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”, “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions” below.
The Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act in reliance on both Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act (provided that the Issuer has the right by
notice to the Trustee to elect to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act and to no longer rely on the exemption from the Investment Company Act provided by Rule 3a-7). Each purchaser of an interest in the Notes (other than a non-U.S. Person outside the U.S.) will be deemed to have represented and agreed that it is a QP and will also be deemed to have made the representations set out in “Transfer Restrictions” herein. The purchaser of any Note, by such purchase, agrees that such Note is being acquired for its own account and not with a view to distribution and may be resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (1) to the Issuer (upon redemption thereof or otherwise), (2) to a person the purchaser reasonably believes is a QIB which is also a QP, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or (3) outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S, in each case, in compliance with the Trust Deed and all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

Obligations which are to constitute Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which the Issuer or the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, has entered into a binding commitment to purchase but which have not yet settled shall be included as Collateral Debt Obligations in the calculation of the Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Debt Obligations in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed.
Coverage TestsEach of the Par Value Tests and Interest Coverage Tests shall be satisfied on a Measurement Date in the case of: (i) the Par Value Tests, on and after the Effective Date; and (ii) the Interest Coverage Tests on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date, if the corresponding Par Value Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio (as the case may be) is at least equal to the percentage specified in the table below in relation to that Coverage Test.

Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test
‎
If the Class F Par Value Ratio is less than 104.24 per cent., on the relevant Determination Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account during the Reinvestment Period, for the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations in an amount (such amount, the “Required Diversion Amount”) equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) to (V) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be met as of the relevant Determination Date after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, such amounts to be applied during the Reinvestment Period to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations.
Authorised DenominationsThe Regulation S Notes of each Class will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 each and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class will be issued in minimum denominations of €250,000 each and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
Form, Registration and Transfer of the Notes
‎The Regulation S Notes of each Class sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more Regulation S Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”). Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may at any time be held only through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Form of the Notes” and “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Interests in any Regulation S Note may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class sold in reliance on Rule 144A within the United States to persons and outside the United States to U.S. Persons, in each case, who are QIB/QPs will be represented on issue by one or more Rule 144A Global Certificates in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may at any time only be held through, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.
The Rule 144A Global Certificates will bear a legend and such Rule 144A Global Certificates, or any interest therein, may not be transferred except in compliance with the transfer restrictions set out in such legend. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
No beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery thereof through a Regulation S Global Certificate unless the transferor provides the Transfer Agent with a written certification substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed regarding compliance with certain of such transfer restrictions. Any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate to a person who takes delivery through an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate is also subject to certification requirements substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed and each purchaser thereof shall be deemed to represent that such purchaser is a QP. In addition, interests in any of the Regulation S Notes may not at any time be held by any U.S. Person or
U.S. Resident. See “Form of the Notes” and “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”.
Except in the limited circumstances described herein, Notes in definitive, certificated, fully registered form (“Definitive Certificates”) will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in either the Regulation S Global Certificates or the Rule 144A Global Certificates. See “Form of the Notes - Exchange for Definitive Certificates”.
Each initial investor (other than the Initial Purchaser) in a Class E Note, Class F Note or a Subordinated Note purchased on the Issue Date will be required to enter into a subscription agreement (and in the case of the Investment Manager, a note purchase agreement) in which it will certify as to, among other matters, its status under the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA. A transferee of a Class E Note, Class F Note or a Subordinated Note (other than a transferee of the Retention Notes) in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. If a transferee is unable to make such deemed representation, such transferee (and, in the case of a transfer of the Retention Notes, the proposed transferee of such Notes) may not acquire such Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note, as applicable, in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate unless such transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (substantially in the form of Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) and as set out in the Trust Deed); and (iii) holds such Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note, as applicable, in the form of a Definitive Certificate. Each purchaser and transferee understands and agrees that no transfer of an interest in Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be permitted or recognised if it would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class).
If a holder of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Regulation S Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, (but in no case for less than the
minimum authorised denomination applicable to such Notes); and (ii) a certificate in the form of part F (Form of Transfer Certificate Relating to Exchange of Definitive Certificate for Regulation S Global Certificate in Respect of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (a copy of which is provided to the Registrar) given by the holder of the beneficial interests in such Notes.
Each person who becomes an owner of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to have represented and agreed to the representations set forth in this Offering Circular relating to such Notes under the heading “Transfer Restrictions”.
If a holder of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (i) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Rule 144A Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (but in no case for less than the minimum authorised denomination applicable to Notes of such Class); and (ii) a certificate in the form of part G (Form of Transfer Certificate Relating to Exchange of Definitive Certificate for Rule 144A Global Certificate in Respect of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (in each case, copies of which are provided to the Registrar as applicable) given by the proposed transferee.
Each person who becomes an owner of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will be deemed to have represented and agreed to the representations set forth in this Offering Circular relating to such Notes under the heading “Transfer Restrictions”.
Transfers of interests in the Notes are subject to certain restrictions and must be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Trust Deed. See “Form of the Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Each purchaser of Notes in making its purchase will be required to make, or will be deemed to have made, certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See “Transfer Restrictions”. The transfer of Notes in breach of certain of such representations and agreements will result in affected Notes becoming subject to certain forced transfer provisions. See Condition 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes).
Governing LawThe Notes, the Trust Deed, the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Agency Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Agreement and all other Transaction Documents (save for the Issuer Management Agreement and the Letter of Undertaking (which are governed by the laws of The Netherlands) and the Euroclear Security Agreement (which is governed by the laws of Belgium)) will be governed
by English law.
Listing Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and trading on its Global Exchange Market. There can be no assurance that any such approval will be granted or, if granted, that such listing will be maintained.
Tax StatusSee “Tax Considerations”.
Certain ERISA ConsiderationsSee “Certain ERISA Considerations”.
Withholding TaxNo gross up of any payments to the Noteholders is required of the Issuer.
See Condition 9 (Taxation).
Forced sale and withholding pursuant to FATCA
‎Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), the Issuer (or an Intermediary) may require each Noteholder to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and certain of its owners. The Issuer (or an Intermediary) may force the sale of a Noteholder’s Notes in order to comply with FATCA, including Notes held by a Noteholder that fails to provide the required information (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value). In addition, the failure to provide such information, or the failure of certain non-U.S. financial institutions to comply with FATCA, may compel the Issuer (or an Intermediary) to withhold on payments to such Noteholders (and the Issuer will not pay any additional amounts with respect to such withholding). See Condition 2(i) (Forced sale pursuant to FATCA).
Additional IssuancesSubject to certain conditions being met, additional Notes of all existing
Classes may be issued and sold. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).
Noteholders should be aware that additional Notes that are treated for non-tax purposes as a single series with the original Notes may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the new Notes may be considered to have been issued with original issue discount, which may affect the market value of the original Notes since such additional Notes may not be distinguishable from the original Notes.
Retention Holder and Retention Requirements
‎The Investment Manager will, in the Risk Retention Letter, for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding and subject as provided below:
(a) covenant and undertake:
(i) to subscribe for, hold and retain, on an ongoing basis, for so long as any Class of Notes remains Outstanding, not less than 5 per cent. of the outstanding nominal value of each Class of Notes (the “Retention Notes”) except as permitted in the proviso below;
(ii) that neither it nor its Affiliates will transfer the Retention Notes or sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under or associated with the Retention Notes or the underlying portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations, except as permitted in the proviso below;
(iii) to take such further action, provide such information,
and enter into such other agreements, in each case as may reasonably be required by the Issuer to satisfy the Retention Requirements as of the Issue Date;
(iv) to provide to the Issuer, on a confidential basis, information in the possession of the Investment Manager, at the cost and expense of the party seeking such information, to the extent the same is not subject to a duty of confidentiality;
(v) to confirm its continued compliance with the covenants set out at paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above:
(A) promptly upon reasonable request made in writing by any of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and Merrill Lynch International; and
(B) in any event on a monthly basis, on the Business Day prior to the date on which the Collateral Administrator compiles the Monthly Report, to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and Merrill Lynch International,
in each case in writing (which may be by way of e-mail and which confirmations the Investment Manager acknowledges may be included by the Collateral Administrator in any Monthly Report);
(vi) that it shall notify each of its Affiliates of the Risk Retention Letter and its contents and in particular the requirements set out in paragraph (a)(ii) above and shall procure that each of its Affiliates comply with the terms of the Risk Retention Letter and in particular paragraph (a)(ii) above;
(vii) that it shall immediately notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and Merrill Lynch International in writing if for any reason:
(A) it ceases to hold the Retention Notes in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above;
(B) it fails to comply with the covenants set out in paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(vi) in any way; or
(C) any of the representations and warranties contained in the Risk Retention Letter fail to be true on any date,
provided that:
(i) if Alcentra Limited is removed as Investment Manager
and none of its Affiliates are appointed as successor Investment Manager, then the Investment Manager (or any of its Affiliates to which the Retention Notes have been transferred in accordance with paragraph (ii) below) may dispose of the Retention Notes provided that such transfer:
(A) is permitted in accordance with the Retention Requirements; and
(B) would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements; and
(ii) the Investment Manager may at any time transfer the Retention Notes to an Affiliate which is part of the same consolidated accounting group as the Investment Manager provided that:
(A) such transfer:
(1) is permitted in accordance with the Retention Requirements; and
(2) would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements; and
(B) if, at any time following (and as a consequence of) such transfer it is necessary to ensure compliance with the Retention Requirements, the Investment Manager shall procure that the Retention Notes are re-transferred to itself or to any other entity permitted under the Retention Requirements at such time; and
(b) represent and warrant, inter alia, that:
(i) it is, and it holds the Retention Notes as, a “sponsor” (as such term is defined in, and for the purposes of, the Retention Requirements); and
(ii) it will continue to retain the Retention Notes pursuant to paragraph (a) above in such capacity.
Should the Investment Manager elect to transfer the Retention Notes in the situation set out in paragraph (i) of the proviso to paragraph (a) above, then such transferee of the Retention Notes shall commit to acquire and retain the Retention Notes on terms substantially identical (mutatis mutandis) to those outlined above. See further “Risk Factors – Risk retention” and “The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements” sections of this Offering Circular.
RISK FACTORS

An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of the Notes and related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations or that investors in the Notes will receive a return of any or all of their investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider, among other things, the following risk factors in addition to the other information and matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meaning set out in this Offering Circular.

1. General Commercial Risks

1.1 General

It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Debt Obligations and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular: (a) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (b) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (c) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (d) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (e) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (f) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes. None of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or the affairs of the Issuer or the Investment Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.
1.2 Suitability

Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer

The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.
1.4 Business and regulatory risks for vehicles with investment strategies such as the Issuer’s

Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in the regulation of the same may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions if market emergencies occur. The regulation of derivatives transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.
1.5 General economic conditions may affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes

Negative economic trends nationally as well as in specific geographic areas of the United States could result in an increase in loan defaults and delinquencies. An inability of obligors to obtain refinancing (particularly as high levels of required refinancings approach) may result in an economic decline that could delay or derail an economic recovery and cause a deterioration in loan performance generally.
Several nations, particularly within the European Union, are currently suffering from significant economic distress. There can be no assurance as to the resolution of the economic problems in those countries, nor as to whether such problems will spread to other countries or otherwise negatively affect wider economies or markets. A debt default by a sovereign nation or other potential consequences of these economic problems may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer and the Notes.
1.6 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets

European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain member states, rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Several countries have experienced or are currently experiencing a “double-dip” recession and there remains a risk of a “double-dip” recession in countries which have experienced modest growth over previous quarters and continued recession in countries which have not yet experienced positive growth since the onset of the global recession.
As discussed further below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.
Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of the current economic conditions. These risks could include, among others: (a) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market; (b) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price; and (c) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their stated Maturity Date. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Investment Manager to invest and, ultimately, the returns on the Notes to investors.
Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Portfolio. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) or collateralised debt obligation (“CDO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.
Many financial institutions including banks continue to suffer from capitalisation issues. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.
It is very likely that one of the effects of the global credit crisis and the failure of financial institutions will be an introduction of a significantly more restrictive regulatory environment including the implementation of new accounting and capital adequacy rules in addition to further regulation of derivative or securitised instruments. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Investment Manager in managing and administering the Portfolio.
While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, high yield, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors, or whether such conditions or markets will deteriorate rather than improve.
1.7 Illiquidity in the CDO, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders

The financial markets have experienced and may experience from time to time substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and non-investment grade bonds and limited liquidity for such instruments. During periods of reduced or limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) deems advantageous may be severely impaired.
Regardless of current or future market conditions, certain Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer will have only a limited trading market (or none). The Issuer’s investment in illiquid debt obligations may restrict its ability to dispose of investments in a timely fashion and for a fair price, as well as its ability to take advantage of market opportunities. Illiquid debt obligations may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments.
In addition, the current liquidity crisis has adversely affected the primary market for a number of financial products, including leveraged loans, which may reduce opportunities for the Issuer to purchase new issuances of Collateral Debt Obligations. The ability of private equity sponsors and leveraged loan arrangers to effectuate new leveraged buy-outs and the ability of the Issuer to purchase such assets may be partially or significantly limited. In Europe, primary leveraged loan activity has been limited and as such the ability of the Issuer to find suitable obligations to invest in may be limited. The impact of the liquidity crisis on the global credit markets may adversely affect the management flexibility of the Investment Manager in relation to the Collateral and, ultimately, the returns on the Notes to investors.
1.8 Euro and Euro Zone Risk

The ongoing deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, in particular Cyprus and Greece, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, particularly France and Germany, has exacerbated the global economic crisis. This situation has also raised a number of uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.
As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. From 1 July 2013, a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), which is activated by mutual agreement, assumed the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing new rescue fund external financial assistance to member states in the Euro zone. The EFSF will cease to exist once all outstanding loans under its existing programmes have been reimbursed. The ESM launched its long term funding programme on 8 October 2013 with the issue of a €7 billion 5-year benchmark bond with a coupon of 1.25%, maturing in October 2018.
Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.
Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. It is difficult to predict the final outcome of the Euro zone crisis. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.
2. Relating to the Notes

2.1 The Notes will have limited liquidity and are subject to substantial transfer restrictions

Although there is currently a limited market for notes representing CLOs similar to the Rated Notes, there is currently no market for the Notes themselves. The Initial Purchaser may make a market for the Notes but is not obliged to do so, and any such market making may be discontinued at any time without notice. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the stated Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.
2.2 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Issuer, the Arranger, Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Liquidity Facility Provider or the Trustee

None of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Liquidity Facility Provider or the Trustee or any Affiliate thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes, and no investor may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance, result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each Noteholder will be required to represent (or, in the case of certain non-certificated Notes, deemed to represent) to the Issuer and the
Initial Purchaser, among other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is within its powers and authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly authorised by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.
2.3 The Initial Purchaser and the Arranger will have no ongoing responsibility for the Collateral Debt Obligations or the actions of the Investment Manager or the Issuer

The Initial Purchaser and the Arranger take no responsibility for and have no obligations in respect of the Issuer, will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Collateral or the actions of the Investment Manager or the Issuer and have no authority to advise the Investment Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Investment Manager and/or the Issuer, as the case may be. If either the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger or its or their Affiliates act as a Hedge Counterparty or own Notes, such entity will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any Noteholders in actions it takes or refrains from taking in such capacity. While the Initial Purchaser or the Arranger may own a portion of certain Classes of Rated Notes on the Issue Date and may own Notes at any time, neither has an obligation to make any investment in any Notes and may sell any Notes it does purchase at any time.
2.4 The Notes are limited recourse obligations; investors must rely on available collections from the Collateral and will have no other source for payment

The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. None of the Investment Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any other Agent, the Liquidity Facility Provider, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Investment Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any other Agent, the Liquidity Facility Provider, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer)) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders; (e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders; and (g) lastly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer.
2.5 The Subordinated Notes

When the holders of the Subordinated Notes are entitled to take or direct any action they may do so in their sole discretion without regard for the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes. Distributions to holders of the Subordinated Notes will be made solely from distributions on the Portfolio after all other payments have been made pursuant to the Priorities of Payment described herein. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Portfolio will be sufficient to make distributions to holders of the Subordinated Notes after making payments that rank senior to payments on the Subordinated Notes. The Issuer’s ability to make distributions to the holders of the Subordinated Notes will be limited by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed. If distributions on the Portfolio are insufficient to make distributions on the Subordinated Notes, no other assets will be available for any such distributions.
2.6 The subordination of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will affect their right to payment; failure of a court to enforce non-petition obligations will adversely affect the Noteholders

The Class A Notes are subordinated to certain amounts payable by the Issuer to other parties as set forth in the Priorities of Payment (including taxes, certain amounts owing to Administrative Expenses, the Senior Investment Management Fee and certain payments under the Hedge Agreements). The Class B Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Class A Notes; the Class C Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes; the Class D Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes; the Class E Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes; the Class F Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes; and the Subordinated Notes are subordinated on each Payment Date to the Rated Notes and certain fees and expenses (including, but not limited to, to redeem the Rated Notes upon an Effective Date Rating Event, unpaid Administrative Expenses, the Senior Investment Management Fee, certain payments under the Hedge Agreements and the Subordinated Investment Management Fee), in each case to the extent described herein. No payments of interest or distributions from Interest Proceeds of any kind will be made on any such Class of Notes on any Payment Date until interest due on the Notes of each Class to which it is subordinated has been paid in full, no payments of principal (other than Deferred Interest, to the extent set forth in the Priorities of Payment) from Principal Proceeds will be made on any such Class of Notes on any Payment Date until principal of the Notes of each Class to which it is subordinated has been paid in full, and no distributions from Principal Proceeds of any kind will be made on the Subordinated Notes on any Payment Date until interest due on and all principal of the Notes of each Class to which it is subordinated has been paid in full. Therefore, to the extent that any losses are suffered by any of the Noteholders, such losses will be borne in the first instance by holders of the Subordinated Notes, then by the holders of the Class F Notes, then by the holders of the Class E Notes, then by the holders of the Class D Notes, then by the holders of the Class C Notes, then by the holders of the Class B Notes, and last by the holders of the Class A Notes. Furthermore, payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes are subject to diversion to pay more senior Classes of Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment if certain Coverage Tests are not met, as described herein, and failure to make such payments will not be a default under the Trust Deed nor under the Conditions of the Notes.
In addition, if an Event of Default occurs, the Controlling Class of Notes (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) will be entitled to determine the remedies to be exercised under the Trust Deed, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed. Remedies pursued by the Controlling Class could be adverse to the interests of the Noteholders that are subordinated to the Notes held by the Controlling Class, and the Controlling Class will have no obligation to consider any possible adverse effect on such other interests. The Collateral Debt Obligations may only be sold and liquidated in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed.
After any acceleration of the Notes, all Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds will be allocated in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments pursuant to which the Notes and certain other amounts owing by the Issuer will be paid in full before any allocation to holders of the Subordinated Notes, and holders of each Class of Notes (along with certain other amounts owing by the Issuer) will be paid in order of seniority until it is paid in full before any allocation is made to holders of the next Class of Notes. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Subordinated Noteholders will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the
Trust Deed. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to the holders of subordinated Classes of Notes following any liquidation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds from the Collateral to pay senior Classes of Notes and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the Issuer.
Each Noteholder will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will not at any time institute against the Issuer, or join any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or other similar law in connection with the obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, it could result in a court, trustee or receiver liquidating the Portfolio notwithstanding the absence of required class voting required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed or failing to liquidate notwithstanding such voting direction.
2.7 Amount and timing of payments

To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as the case may be, and shall earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class B Notes (so long as the Class A Notes are Outstanding), Class C Notes (so long as the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class D Notes (so long as the Class C Notes are Outstanding), to pay scheduled interest on the Class E Notes (so long as the Class D Notes are Outstanding), or to pay scheduled interest on the Class F Notes (so long as the Class E Notes are Outstanding) or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be an Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Debt Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
2.8 Yield considerations on the Subordinated Notes

The yield to each holder of the Subordinated Notes will be a function of the purchase price paid by such holder for its Subordinated Notes and the timing and amount of distributions made in respect of the Subordinated Notes during the term of the transaction. Each prospective investor in the Subordinated Notes should make its own evaluation of the yield that it expects to receive on the Subordinated Notes. Prospective investors should be aware that the timing and amount of distributions will be affected by, among other things, the performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer. Each prospective investor should consider the risk that an Event of Default or other adverse performance will result in a lower yield on the Subordinated Notes than that anticipated by such investor. In addition, if the Collateral Debt Obligations (in aggregate) fail any Coverage Test, amounts that would otherwise be distributed to the holders of the Subordinated Notes on any Payment Date may be paid to other investors in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Each prospective investor should consider that any such adverse developments could result in its failure to recover fully its initial investment in the Subordinated Notes.
2.9 The Subordinated Notes are highly leveraged, which increases risks to investors in that Class

The Subordinated Notes represent a highly leveraged investment in the Portfolio. Therefore, the market value of the Subordinated Notes would be anticipated to be significantly affected by, among other things, changes in the market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations, changes in the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations, defaults and recoveries on the Collateral Debt Obligations, capital gains and losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations,
prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations, the availability, prices and interest rates of the Collateral Debt Obligations and other risks associated with the Portfolio as described in “Risk Factors - Relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations”. Accordingly, the Subordinated Notes may not be paid in full and may be subject to up to 100 per cent. loss. Furthermore, the leveraged nature of the Subordinated Notes may magnify the adverse impact on the Subordinated Notes of changes in the market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations, changes in the distributions on the Collateral Debt Obligations, defaults and recoveries on the Collateral Debt Obligations, capital gains and losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations, prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations and availability, prices and interest rates of the Collateral Debt Obligations.
Payments of Interest Proceeds to the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not be made until due and unpaid interest on the Rated Notes and certain other amounts (including certain fees and expenses) have been paid. No payments of principal of the Subordinated Notes will be made until principal of and interest on the Rated Notes and certain other amounts have been paid in full. On any Payment Date, sufficient funds may not be available (including as a result of a failure of any of the Coverage Tests) to make payments to the holders of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Following an acceleration of the Notes which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) or pursuant to an Optional Redemption in whole in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds, Principal Proceeds and the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be paid or returned to a Hedge Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payment in accordance with the Hedge Agreement and other than with respect to amounts deposited in the Prefunded Commitment Account which are repayable to the Liquidity Facility Provider pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement) shall be credited to the Payment Account and shall be allocated in accordance with the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments pursuant to which the Rated Notes and certain other amounts owing by the Issuer will be paid in full before any allocation to the Subordinated Notes, and each Class of Notes (along with certain other amounts owing by the Issuer) will be paid in order of seniority until it is paid in full before any allocation is made to the next Class of Notes. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any creditors’ rights against the Issuer and will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the Trust Deed. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to the holders of subordinated Classes of Notes following any liquidation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds from the Collateral to pay senior Classes of Notes and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the Issuer.
Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the Collateral of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to any particular Class of Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.
2.10 The Portfolio may be insufficient to redeem the Notes following an Event of Default

It is anticipated that the proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes, net of certain fees and expenses, will be less than the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem all of the Notes if an Event of Default under the Trust Deed occurs on or about that date.
2.11 The Reinvestment Period may terminate early

The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following an Event of Default; (b) an Optional Redemption; or (c) the Investment Manager reasonably determines that it can no longer reinvest in additional Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria and the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Notes and may also cause Noteholders to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.
2.12 The Investment Manager may reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations after the end of the Reinvestment Period

After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager may still reinvest: (a) Unscheduled Principal Proceeds; (b) Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations; and (c) Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions described under “The Portfolio” below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
2.13 The Trust Deed requires mandatory redemption of the Notes for failure to satisfy Coverage Tests and if an Effective Date Rating Event occurs

If any Coverage Test with respect to any Class or Classes of Notes is not met on any Determination Date on which such Coverage Test is applicable, or an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing: (a) Interest Proceeds that otherwise would have been paid or distributed to the Noteholders of each Class (other than Class A Notes and Class B Notes) that is subordinated to such Class or Classes; and (b) (during the Reinvestment Period and with respect to Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, after the Reinvestment Period) Principal Proceeds that would otherwise have been reinvested in Collateral Debt Obligations, will instead be used to redeem the Notes of the most senior Class or Classes then Outstanding, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable Coverage Tests or until such Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing. This could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the payments of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and/or the Subordinated Notes, as the case may be. In addition, a mandatory redemption of Notes owing to an Effective Date Rating Event could result in the Investment Manager causing the Issuer to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.
2.14 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the option of the Investment Manager

The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) notifies the Trustee that it has been unable, for a period of at least twenty consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, comply with the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes. See Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption).
2.15 Additional issuances of Notes may have different terms and may have the effect of preventing the failure of the Coverage Tests and the occurrence of an Event of Default

The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes of any one or more existing Classes and use the net proceeds to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes or for other purposes permitted under the Trust Deed. If certain conditions for such additional issuance are met, such additional issuance may be made without the consent of the Noteholders (save for (a) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, (b) in the case of the issuance of additional Class A Notes, subject to the approval of the Class A Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and (c) the Retention Holder). The conditions that must be satisfied in connection with an additional issuance of Notes include (without limitation and as described further in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances)) the following: (a) such additional issuances in relation to the applicable Class of Notes may not exceed 100 per cent. in the aggregate of the original aggregate principal amount of such Class of
Notes; (b) the terms (other than the date of issuance, the issue price and the date from which interest will accrue) of such Notes must be identical to the terms of the previously issued Notes of the applicable Class of Notes; (c) the Coverage Tests must be satisfied or if not satisfied, will be maintained or improved following such additional issuance; (d) the Retention Holder consenting to purchase a sufficient amount of each Class of Notes which are subject of the additional issuance such that its holding equals no less than 5 per cent. of the nominal value of such Class or Classes of Notes; (e) so long as the Issuer has not elected (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act by providing written notice thereof to the Trustee, an opinion of counsel has been delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee confirming that neither the Issuer nor the Portfolio will be required to register under the Investment Company Act as a result of such additional issuance and that the Issuer will continue to be in compliance with the requirements for the registration exemption pursuant to Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act after such issuances; and (f) the Issuer may only issue and sell additional Subordinated Notes three times and on each such occasion the aggregate principal amount of such issuance may not be less than EUR1,000,000. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).
The use of issuance proceeds of any additional issuances as Principal Proceeds may have the effect of causing a Coverage Test that was otherwise failing to be cured or modifying the effect of events that would otherwise give rise to an Event of Default and permit the Controlling Class to exercise remedies under the Trust Deed.
2.16 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class

The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds (or a combination thereof) (a) on any day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, either (i) at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or (ii) save where a Retention Event has occurred and is continuing, at the written direction of the Retention Holder; or (b) on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution).
In addition, the Rated Notes may be redeemed in part by Class from Refinancing Proceeds at the applicable Redemption Prices, from any Refinancing Proceeds on any Payment Date falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period at the written direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices. Any such redemption shall be of an entire Class or Classes of Notes subject to a number of conditions. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
The Investment Manager may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Payment Date falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Aggregate Collateral Balance is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. See Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Investment Manager Clean-up Call).
As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part, such Refinancing will only be effective if (a) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to S&P and Moody’s; (b) all Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments received in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Trust Deed, and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes save for the Subordinated Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment (subject to any election by the holders of any Rated Notes to receive less than
100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments; (c) all Principal Proceeds, Refinancing Proceeds, Sale Proceeds, if any, and other available funds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption; (d) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed; and (e) all Refinancing Proceeds and all Sale Proceeds from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer prior to the applicable Redemption Date (in each case as notified to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Investment Manager).
In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class, such Refinancing will only be effective if: (a) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to S&P and Moody’s; (b) the Refinancing Obligations are in the form of notes; (c) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption; (d) the sum of (i) the Refinancing Proceeds and (ii) the amount of Interest Proceeds standing to the credit of the Interest Account in excess of the aggregate amount of Interest Proceeds which would be applied in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments prior to paying any amount in respect of the Subordinated Notes will be at least sufficient to pay in full: (A) the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption; plus (B) all accrued and unpaid Trustee Fees and Expenses and Administrative Expenses in connection with such Refinancing; (e) the Refinancing Proceeds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption; (f) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed; (g) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Obligations for each Class is equal to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds; (h) the maturity date of each class of Refinancing Obligation is the same as the Maturity Date of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed; (i) the interest rate of any Refinancing Obligations will not be greater than the interest rate of the Rated Notes subject to such Optional Redemption (taking into account any discount on issuance);
(j) payments in respect of the Refinancing Obligations are subject to the Priorities of Payment and rank at the same priority pursuant to the Priorities of Payment as the relevant Class or Classes of Rated Notes being redeemed; (k) the voting rights, consent rights, redemption rights and all other rights of the Refinancing Obligations are the same as the rights of the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed; (l) all Refinancing Proceeds are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and (m) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, the Issuer will continue to be in compliance with the requirements for the registration exemption under Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, in each case as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Investment Manager.
The Trust Deed provides that no party (including the Subordinated Noteholders) will have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer and, at the direction of the Investment Manager, the Trustee shall amend the Trust Deed and the Transaction Documents to the extent necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of any Class of Notes other than from the holders of the Subordinated Notes by way of Ordinary Resolution. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).
The Notes shall also be redeemed on any Payment Date in whole but not in part at the written direction of (a) the Controlling Class or (b) the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event, subject to (i) the Issuer having failed to change the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes; and (ii) certain minimum time periods. See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes at the direction of either: (i) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); or (ii) the Investment Manager.
If an early redemption occurs, the Noteholders will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Investment Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Debt Obligations sold.
2.17 A decrease in EURIBOR will lower the interest payable on the Notes and an increase in EURIBOR may indirectly reduce the credit support to the Notes

The Notes accrue interest at EURIBOR. On the Issue Date, the Notes will accrue interest at three-month EURIBOR. During a Frequency Switch Period, the Notes will accrue interest at six-month EURIBOR (except, in certain circumstances, in respect of the first Payment Date following the Frequency Switch Period), provided that if a Frequency Switch Period will commence during the following Accrual Period the Notes will accrue interest at six- month EURIBOR from the Interest Determination Date immediately prior to a Frequency Switch Period. If at the time of the Interest Determination Date immediately prior to a Frequency Switch Period it was not known that a Frequency Switch Period would commence during the following Accrual Period, the accrual of interest at on the Notes at six-month EURIBOR will commence from the Interest Determination Date immediately after the Frequency Switch Period begins.
The interest rate may fluctuate from one Accrual Period to another in response to changes in EURIBOR. The Subordinated Notes do not bear a stated rate of interest. EURIBOR has, in the past, experienced high volatility and significant fluctuations. It is possible that EURIBOR will continue to fluctuate and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator, the Investment Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates make any representation as to the level of EURIBOR in the future. Because the Rated Notes bear interest based upon three-month EURIBOR, or six-month EURIBOR during a Frequency Switch Period (except, in certain circumstances, in respect of the first Payment Date following the Frequency Switch Period), as described in Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Floating Rate Notes), there may be a basis mismatch between the Rated Notes and the underlying Collateral with interest rates based on an index other than EURIBOR, interest rates based on EURIBOR for a different period of time or even three-month or six-month EURIBOR for a different accrual period. In addition, up to 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments may bear interest at a fixed rate. It is possible that EURIBOR payable on the Rated Notes may rise (or fall) during periods in which EURIBOR (or another applicable index) with respect to the various Collateral is stable or falling (or rising but capped at a level lower than EURIBOR for the Rated Notes). No assurance can be made that the portion of Floating Rate Collateral Debt Obligations of the Issuer that bear interest based on indices other than EURIBOR will not increase in the future. Some Collateral Debt Obligations, however, may have EURIBOR floor arrangements that may help mitigate this risk, but there is no requirement for any Collateral Debt Obligation to have a EURIBOR floor and there is no guarantee that any such EURIBOR floor will fully mitigate the risk of falling EURIBOR. If EURIBOR payable on the Rated Notes rises during periods in which EURIBOR (or another applicable index) with respect to the various Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments is stable or during periods in which the Issuer owns assets forming part of the Collateral bearing interest at a fixed rate, is falling or is rising but is capped at a lower level, “excess spread” (i.e., the difference between the interest collected on the Collateral and the sum of the interest payable on the Rated Notes and certain transaction fees payable by the Issuer) that otherwise would be available as credit support may instead be used to pay interest on the Rated Notes.
In circumstances where, during a Frequency Switch Period, the Payment Dates have become 15 January and 15 July each year (in accordance with the definition of “Payment Date”), the final Accrual Period prior to the Maturity Date will be a three-month period, but the EURIBOR rate applicable to this final Accrual Period will be six-month EURIBOR. As a result, depending on the difference between the offered rate for 3-month EURIBOR and the offered rate for 6-month EURIBOR, interest accrued during this final Accrual Period may be higher or lower than a three- month Accrual Period to which three-month EURIBOR was applicable.
There may also be a timing mismatch between the Rated Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations as EURIBOR (or other applicable index) on such Collateral Debt Obligations may adjust more frequently or less frequently, on different dates than EURIBOR on the Rated Notes. Such a mismatch could result in the Issuer not collecting sufficient Interest Proceeds to make interest payments on the Rated Notes. Although it is intended that the Issuer enters into a Liquidity Facility Agreement and Interest Smoothing, as further described herein, the Issuer may or may not enter into interest rate swap transactions to hedge any interest rate or timing mismatch. To the extent described herein, the Issuer may enter into Hedge Agreements to reduce the effect of any such interest rate mismatch. The Investment Manager shall only cause the Issuer to enter into Hedge Agreements that: (a) either (i) comply with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time such Hedge Agreements are entered into; or (ii) in respect of which, the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable international legal counsel that such arrangements will not in respect of a CPO, and should not in the case of a CTA, cause the Issuer, its directors or officers, the
Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA; and (b) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, either (i) comply with the Trading Requirements and the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time such Hedge Agreements are entered into; or (ii) in respect of which the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable international legal counsel that the acquisition of or entry into such Hedge Agreement will not eliminate the Issuer’s ability to rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act. See “Hedging Arrangements”.
Even if the Issuer were to enter into one or more Hedge Agreements, there can be no assurance that the Collateral Debt Obligations and the Eligible Investments will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Rated Notes and to make distributions to the holders of the Subordinated Notes, nor that the Hedge Agreements will ensure any particular return on any such Notes.
2.18 Interest Rate Mismatch

In addition, some Collateral Debt Obligations may permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis during a Frequency Switch Period (except, in certain circumstances, in respect of the first Payment Date following the Frequency Switch Period) and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Debt Obligations re-set to semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mismatch, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest less than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”) (at all times other than during a Frequency Switch Period). In addition, the Issuer shall enter in to the Liquidity Facility Agreement with the Liquidity Facility Provider whereby the Issuer shall under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, be able to draw down on a liquidity facility to fund payments of interest on each Class of Rated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment on any Payment Date, but in any event in an amount not exceeding the Accrued Collateral Debt Obligation Interest in relation to the relevant Payment Date, each subject to certain limitations as further described in “Description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and any amounts which are able to be drawn in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing mismatch. In relation to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, see also “Risk Factors - Counterparty Risk” below.
There can be no assurance that the Collateral securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
2.19 Counterparty Risk

Participations, the Liquidity Facility Agreement and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Each such counterparty is required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.
In the event that a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless within the applicable remedy period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy as results in the rating of the Rated Notes being maintained at their then current level within the remedy period specified in the ratings criteria of the Rating Agencies or is otherwise approved by the Rating Agencies. For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.
In the event that the Liquidity Facility Provider is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to a rating below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Liquidity Facility Provider must use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer its obligations under the Liquidity Facility Agreement to a replacement liquidity facility provider which satisfies the Rating Requirement and is acceptable to the Issuer and the Investment Manager within the relevant remedy period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade and, if it does not do so within such remedy period, it must collateralise its obligations in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement” below.
Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. In the event that the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall (at the expense of the Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be) use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement which is acceptable to the Trustee within thirty calendar days of such withdrawal or downgrade.
2.20 The average lives of the Notes may vary

The average life of each Class of Notes is expected to be shorter than the number of years until the stated Maturity Date. Each such average life may vary due to various factors affecting the early retirement of Collateral Debt Obligations from payments, defaults, or otherwise, the timing and amount of sales of such Collateral Debt Obligations, the ability of the Investment Manager to invest collections and proceeds in additional Collateral Debt Obligations, and the occurrence of any Mandatory Redemption, Optional Redemption, redemption following a Note Tax Event or a Special Redemption. Retirement of the Collateral Debt Obligations prior to their respective final maturities will depend, among other things, on the financial condition of the issuers of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and the respective characteristics of such Collateral Debt Obligations, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional redemption, mandatory redemption or sinking fund features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption prices, the actual default rates and the actual amount collected on any Defaulted Obligations and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Debt Obligations. In particular, loans are generally prepayable at par, and a high proportion of loans could be prepaid. The ability of the Issuer to reinvest proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates that satisfy the reinvestment criteria specified herein may affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. See “The Portfolio”.
2.21 Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain

Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Debt Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Debt Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
2.22 Certain ERISA considerations

Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in the Class E Notes, the
Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes, the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. See “Certain ERISA Considerations”.
2.23 Changes in tax law; no gross up

At the time when Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, the Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Debt Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in market practice, any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations (including payments by Selling Institutions in the case of Participations) might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to gross up to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of: (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made; (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the Obligor; or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Debt Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross if paid in the ordinary course of its business. If the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Debt Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest, principal on the stated Maturity Date and other amounts payable in respect of the Notes of each Class.
2.24 UK taxation of Issuer

The Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if and only if it is: (a) tax resident in the UK, or (b) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is in The Netherlands. The Managing Directors of the Issuer intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.
The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Investment Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Investment Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.
Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Investment Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it will not be subject to UK corporation tax if the exemption in Article 5(6) of the UK- Netherlands tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Investment Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty. It should be noted that the specific domestic UK corporation tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) may not be available in the context of this transaction if the Investment Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes. However, the inapplicability of this domestic exemption should not have any effect on the UK corporation tax position of the Issuer if the exemption in Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty, as referred to above, applies.
Should the Investment Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it will be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative
Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under paragraphs
(C) and (Y) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraphs (A) and (R) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments or paragraphs (C) and (X) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Investment Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay, under paragraph (A) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable, UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities. The Issuer would also be liable to pay, under paragraph (A) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable, UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK.
2.25 Noteholders may be subject to withholding or forced sale for failure to provide certain tax information

Under U.S. tax legislation colloquially referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), a 30 per cent. withholding tax is imposed on certain payments of U.S. source income and gross proceeds from the sale of property that produces certain U.S. source income to certain non-United States persons that are “foreign financial institutions” as defined in section 1471(d)(4) of the Code (“FFIs”), such as the Issuer, unless certain conditions are satisfied. Generally, the withholding tax is phased in over several years and applies to payments of U.S. source income made on or after 1 July 2014, to certain gross proceeds paid on or after 1 January 2017 and certain other “passthru payments” (described below) no earlier than 1 January 2017. As a general matter, FATCA withholding tax (which is not expected to be refundable with respect to the Issuer) will not be imposed if (i) the payment is made with respect to an obligation outstanding on or prior to 30 June 2014 (that has not been materially modified after 30 June 2014 and treated as reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (a “Grandfathered Obligation”), or (ii) if required to do so, the Issuer (and each foreign withholding agent (if any) in the chain of custody of payments made to the Issuer, such person, an “Intermediary”) enters into an agreement (an “IRS Agreement”) with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that requires the Issuer to satisfy certain withholding tax and information reporting requirements regarding its U.S. Holders (such information being “Noteholder FATCA Information”). For this purpose, the term “obligation” does not include obligations that lack a definitive expiration or term (such as savings or demand deposits) or equities. The debt obligations of U.S. Obligors held by the Issuer generally should be Grandfathered Obligations if such obligations were outstanding as of (and not materially modified after) 30 June 2014 (even if the Issuer purchases the obligation after 30 June 2014).
If it is required to do so in order to avoid FATCA withholding, the Issuer expects to enter into an IRS Agreement. Under the terms of such an agreement, the Issuer is expected to be obliged to comply with certain withholding tax obligations imposed on payments made to certain FFIs that fail to enter into an IRS Agreement and holders that fail to provide Noteholder FATCA Information to the Issuer that would enable the Issuer to comply with its own information reporting obligations (such Noteholders, “Recalcitrant Noteholders”). As such, the Issuer will be obliged to withhold tax at a 30 per cent. rate on certain “passthru payments” made to Recalcitrant Noteholders. Such withholding would begin no earlier than 1 January 2017. Preliminary guidance that was not included in the final regulations suggested that a payment on a Note will be treated as a passthru payment to the extent of (i) the amount (if any) of the payment that is treated as U.S. source payments plus (ii) the remainder of the payment multiplied by a ratio equal to the Issuer’s average U.S. assets to its average total assets, determined as of specified testing dates. U.S. assets are likely to be defined broadly for purposes of this determination. Although the final regulations do not contain the above formulation, the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has indicated that rules defining foreign passthru payments (clause (ii) of the definition above) will be issued at a later date. Thus, it is unclear if the eventual rule for withholding with respect to the non-U.S. source portion of payments described in (ii) above will adopt this assets-based approach. Further, a debt obligation (such as the Notes) that does not produce
U.S. source payments will be grandfathered if the obligation is outstanding six months after the adoption of final regulations addressing withholding on foreign passthru payments. Because such regulations have yet to be adopted and payments on the Notes are expected to be comprised solely of non-U.S. source payments, the Notes (other than Subordinated Notes and any other Class of Notes that are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) are not expected to be subject to tax since such securities should be treated as Grandfathered Obligations. The Subordinated Notes (and any other Class of Notes that are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) are
not eligible for grandfathering because they represent equity in the Issuer. See “Tax Considerations - United States Federal Income Taxation”.
In addition, if an FFI Affiliate of the Issuer is not FATCA compliant (i.e., it fails to comply with (and is not exempted from complying with) FATCA), the Issuer itself may be prohibited from complying with FATCA. For this purpose, an “FFI Affiliate” generally is an FFI that is deemed to be part of an affiliated group that includes the Issuer (where, in general, such Affiliates and the Issuer are deemed related through more than 50 per cent. ownership). For example, if an FFI owns (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer’s equity and such FFI equity owner is not FATCA compliant, the Issuer may not be eligible to comply with FATCA. Furthermore, in certain cases, if an entity is deemed (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to own more than 50 per cent. of the equity of both (i) the Issuer and (ii) another FFI, such other FFI may be treated as an FFI Affiliate of the Issuer for this purpose and, thus, if such other FFI is not FATCA compliant, the Issuer may be prohibited from complying with FATCA. For these purposes, ownership by a person of the majority of the Subordinated Notes of the Issuer is likely to constitute the requisite ownership by that person of the Issuer. Similarly ownership by a person of a majority of the ordinary share capital of another FFI or, in the case of another FFI which is a special purpose entity similar to the Issuer, of the most junior class and any other class treated as equity for U.S. federal tax purposes of such other FFI, is likely to constitute the requisite ownership by that person of such other FFI.
Although the Issuer will not prohibit any Noteholder from accumulating more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer’s equity (for United States federal income tax purposes), as a condition to acquiring its interest in any Notes, each Noteholder that is an FFI will be deemed to agree and represent that it will at all relevant times use its best efforts, if it is an FFI Affiliate of the Issuer, to be a participating FFI or a registered deemed compliant FFI. Further the Issuer does retain the right to force the sale of all or any portion of such equity if such holding prevents the Issuer from complying with FATCA. For these purposes, the Issuer may sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.
The United States has recently concluded several intergovernmental agreements (“IGAs”) with other jurisdictions in respect of FATCA. On 18 December 2013, an IGA was entered into between The Netherlands and the United States. If enacted by The Netherlands, the Issuer will be required to comply with legislation which is implemented to give effect to such IGA. In that event, the Issuer would be subject to modified FATCA requirements.
The Issuer is permitted to make amendments to the Trust Deed and the Conditions of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders to provide for the issuance of a new Class of Notes or the creation of sub-classes of such Class of Notes (in each case, with new identifiers) if it or the Trustee determines that one or more beneficial owners of such Class of Notes is a Recalcitrant Noteholder. The intent of such amendments would be to allow holders of such Class that are not Recalcitrant Noteholders to take an interest in such new Note(s) or sub-class(es) in order to isolate the identity of the Recalcitrant Noteholder(s) and lessen the likelihood that Noteholders, other than any applicable Recalcitrant Noteholder(s), would be subject to withholding due to the failure of a Recalcitrant Noteholder to provide the Issuer with Noteholder FATCA Information. However, there can be no assurance that any such amendments will be made or, if they are, that they will have the effect of eliminating or reducing withholding on any Noteholders’ Notes caused by a Recalcitrant Noteholder.
If the Issuer is required but fails to enter into an IRS Agreement or its IRS Agreement is invalidated by the IRS (because it failed to comply with the terms of such agreement or for any other reason) (or if it fails to comply with the requirements of an IGA), it could be subject to a material amount of withholding that would substantially reduce the amount of cash available to pay all its Noteholders, and such withholding may be allocated disproportionately to a particular class of Noteholders (including Noteholders that have provided the Issuer with all requested information) and there will be no “gross up” (or any other additional amount) payable by way of compensation to the Noteholders for the deducted amounts and no Event of Default shall occur as a result of such withholding or deduction. In addition, if the Issuer reasonably believes that it is required under FATCA (including an IRS Agreement entered into with a tax authority) to closeout any Noteholder for failing to comply with its requests for Noteholder FATCA Information, it may cause the forced transfer of Notes (including some held by compliant Noteholders) and such transfers may be for less than the fair market value of such Notes. For these purposes, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a Noteholder’s interest in its Notes in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a
portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA. If the Issuer is required to sell the Notes, the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly transact in securities and selling such Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the Noteholder to the Recalcitrant Noteholder by its acceptance of an interest in the Notes agrees to co-operate with the Issuer and the Trustee to effect such transfers. The terms and conditions of any such transfer shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer subject to the transfer restrictions set out in this Offering Circular and the Trust Deed, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
Under the Trust Deed, each Noteholder or beneficial owner of a Note will agree or be deemed to agree to (i) provide the Issuer and any applicable Intermediary with Noteholder FATCA Information and (ii) permit the Issuer, the Investment Manager, an Intermediary and the Trustee (on behalf of the Issuer) to (x) share such Noteholder FATCA Information with the IRS and any other tax authority, (y) compel or effect the sale of Notes held by any such Noteholder that fails to comply with the foregoing requirement or prevents the Issuer from complying with FATCA and (z) make other amendments to the Trust Deed to enable the Issuer to comply with FATCA and/or assign to such Note a separate identification numbers.
2.26 Forced transfer

Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition, each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule l44A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Holder”) or a Noteholder is a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) transfer its interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder or Non-Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) within thirty days (or fourteen days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder) of the date of such notice. If such Non-Permitted Holder or Non- Permitted ERISA Holder (as applicable) fails to effect the transfer required within such thirty day period (or fourteen day period in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder): (i) upon direction from the Issuer or the Investment Manager on its behalf, the Transfer Agent, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a commercially reasonable sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder; and (ii) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.
Under FATCA, the Issuer may enter into an agreement with the IRS pursuant to which it will be required to, among other things, provide Noteholder FATCA Information to a tax authority.
The Issuer may force the sale of a Noteholder’s Notes in order to comply with FATCA, including Notes held by a Noteholder that fails to provide the required Noteholder FATCA Information or if the Issuer otherwise reasonably determines that a Noteholder’s acquisition or holding of an interest in such a Note would cause the Issuer to be unable to comply with FATCA (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value). For these purposes, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a Noteholder’s interest in its Notes in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA. If the Issuer is required to force such sale, the Transfer Agent, at the direction of the Issuer, shall require the Noteholder to sell its Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer on such terms as the Issuer may choose, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and neither the Issuer nor the
Transfer Agent shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
2.27 United States tax characterisation of the Notes

The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of the Notes, each holder thereof will be deemed to have agreed, to treat the Rated Notes as debt of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law and for certain limited purposes (as described in “Tax Considerations”). The determination of whether a Note will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the Note is issued. Prospective investors should be aware that the Issuer’s intended characterisations of the Rated Notes are not binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise as something other than indebtedness any particular Class or Classes of the Rated Notes.
The Issuer has agreed and, by its acceptance of a Subordinated Note, each holder thereof will be deemed to have agreed, to treat such Subordinated Note as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable law. Prospective investors should be aware that the Issuer’s intended characterisations of the Subordinated Notes are not binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not seek to characterise as something other than equity any particular Subordinated Notes.
2.28 Adverse Effect of Determination of U.S. Trade or Business

It is intended that the Issuer will not operate so as to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, accordingly, will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its net income. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Issuer is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, there could be material adverse financial consequences to the Issuer and to persons who hold the Notes. There can be no assurance, that the Issuer’s net income will not become subject to U.S. federal net income tax as a result of unanticipated activities by the Issuer, changes in law, contrary conclusions by U.S. tax authorities or other causes. In such a case, the Issuer would be potentially subject to substantial U.S. federal income tax and, in certain circumstances interest payments by the Issuer under the Notes could be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The imposition of any of the foregoing taxes would materially affect the Issuer’s ability to pay principal, interest, and other amounts owing in respect of the Notes.
2.29 Withholding tax on the Notes

Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, as discussed above, the Issuer has the right to withhold up to 30 per cent. on all payments made to any beneficial owner of an interest in any of the Notes that fails to comply with its requests for Noteholder FATCA Information to enable the Issuer to comply with FATCA (including any IRS Agreement entered into with a tax authority pursuant thereto or to certain FFIs that fail to enter into a FATCA agreement with the IRS). The Issuer is not required to make any “gross-up” payments in respect of any withholding tax applied in respect of the Notes.
If a Note Tax Event occurs pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax, the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
2.30 Notes issued in additional issuances by the Issuer may not be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes with Notes issued on the Issue Date

Whether any new notes would be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes with the Notes issued on the Issue Date would depend on whether the issuance of such new securities would be treated as a “qualified
reopening” within the meaning of U.S. Treasury regulations. This determination will depend on facts that cannot be determined at this time, possibly including the date on which such issuance occurs, the yield of the Notes at that time Outstanding (based on their fair market value) and whether any Notes at that time Outstanding are publicly traded or quoted at that time (which will depend, in part, on whether the stated principal amount of the Notes at that time Outstanding exceeds $100 million). In addition, potential investors should note that Notes issued after 30 June 2014 which are expressed to be consolidated and form a single series with previously issued Notes may not be treated as a qualified reopening and, thus, may not be grandfathered under FATCA, even if the previously issued Notes originally were grandfathered under FATCA (such Notes, “Grandfathered Securities”). Finally, the issuance of Notes after 30 June 2014 which are expressed to be consolidated and form a single series with Notes that otherwise qualify as Grandfathered Securities should not, as a legal matter, affect the grandfathering status of the previously Grandfathered Securities. However, potential investors in the Notes should be aware that, as a practical matter, it may not be possible for a paying agent or an Intermediary to differentiate between Grandfathered Securities and non-Grandfathered Securities of the same series held in a securities account and that no Note in the series may be treated by the paying agent or Intermediary as Grandfathered Securities. In light of this, a paying agent or intermediary may withhold on payments in respect of a Grandfathered Security.
2.31 The Issuer is recently formed, has no significant operating history, has no assets other than the Collateral and is limited in its permitted activities

The Issuer is a recently incorporated entity and has no prior operating history or track record other than in connection with any Warehouse Facility, any asset/forward sale or purchase agreements or trade confirmations which may be entered into to acquire or commit to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date and any other activities described in this Offering Circular. Accordingly, the Issuer has no performance history for investors to consider in making their decision to invest in the Notes.
2.32 The Issuer may be subject to third party litigation; the Issuer has limited funds available to pay its expenses

The Issuer’s investment activities may subject it to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending against claims against the Issuer by third parties, including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that the Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets.
The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Investment Manager and TMF Management B.V. and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited to amounts available to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, TMF Management
B.V. and/or the Investment Manager may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against them or that they might otherwise bring to protect the interests of the Issuer. In addition, service providers who are not paid in full, including TMF Management B.V. which provides the Managing Directors, have the right to resign. This could ultimately lead to the Issuer being in default under the applicable laws of The Netherlands and potentially being removed from the register of companies and dissolved.
2.33 Issuer Reliance on Rule 3a-7

It is expected that the Issuer will be relying on an exemption from the definition of investment company, and from the resulting requirement to register under the Investment Company Act, that in turn depends on the Issuer not being an investment company required to register under the Investment Company Act by reason of Rule 3a-7 thereunder (“Rule 3a-7”). So long as the Issuer relies on Rule 3a-7, its ability (and the ability of the Investment Manager on its behalf) to acquire and dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities or Eligible Investments may be limited, which could adversely affect its ability to realise gains, mitigate losses or reinvest principal payments or sale proceeds. In particular, there are restrictions on discretionary trading other than in respect of Defaulted Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities or Credit Impaired Obligations
(noting that the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) will still apply). These restrictions may adversely affect the return to holders of the Notes.
In 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to potentially consider proposing amendments to Rule 3a-7. Any guidance from the SEC or its staff regarding Rule 3a-7, including changes that the SEC may ultimately adopt to Rule 3a-7, that narrow the scope of Rule 3a-7, could further inhibit the business activities of the Issuer and adversely affect the holders of the Notes.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will satisfy the requirements of Rule 3a- 7 or that any investor will be able to treat the Issuer as exempt under Rule 3a-7 for such purposes, and the Issuer makes no representation with respect thereto. It is expected that, in connection with certain capital raising activities of certain investors in the Notes and other investors in collateralised debt obligation securities, the SEC may consider the applicability of Rule 3a-7 to the Issuer or other issuers engaged in similar activities. There can be no assurance as to the results of any such consideration, and such action by the SEC could adversely affect the Issuer and the Noteholders. If necessary as a result of such consideration or otherwise, in order to permit the Issuer to rely on Rule 3a-7 or otherwise avoid constituting an investment company required to register under the Investment Company Act, the Issuer will be permitted to amend the Trust Deed and/or the Conditions of the Notes without the consent of the Noteholders. Such amendments could result in additional limitations on the ability of the Issuer to purchase and sell Collateral Debt Obligations, among other restrictions, and could adversely affect the return to Noteholders.
2.34 Non-compliance with restrictions on ownership of the Notes and the Investment Company Act could adversely affect the Issuer

The Issuer has not registered with the SEC as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exception or exemption therefrom. In addition to the exemption under Rule 3a-7 noted above, the Issuer intends to comply with the requirements of the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for investment companies (a) whose investors residing in the United States are QPs and “knowledgeable employees” with respect to the Issuer and certain transferees thereof identified in Rules 3c-5 and 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
The Issuer has not registered with the SEC as an investment company based on the fact that the Issuer has and will have no assets that could be construed as the holding of “securities” under the Investment Company Act. To satisfy the requirements of Section 3(c)(7), the Issuer must have a “reasonable belief” that all purchasers of the Notes which reside in the United States (including initial purchasers and subsequent transferees of Notes sold to initial purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A) are QPs. Because transfers of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Notes will be generally effected only through DTC and its participants and indirect participants without delivery of written transferee certifications to the Issuer, the Issuer will establish such a reasonable belief by means of the deemed representations, warranties and agreements described under “Transfer and Exchange,” the agreements of the initial purchasers relating to Rule 144A and Regulation S referred to under “Transfer and Exchange” and by taking certain other actions pursuant to the Trust Deed. Although the SEC has stated that it is possible for an issuer of securities to satisfy the reasonable belief standard referred to above by establishing procedures to provide a means by which such issuer can make a reasonable determination as to the status of its holders of securities as QPs, the SEC has not approved - and has stated that it will not approve - any particular set of procedures, including the Section 3(c)(7) procedures contemplated by the Trust Deed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will satisfy the reasonable belief standard referred to above.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and recover any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any agreement to which the Issuer is party that is made in violation of the Investment Company Act or whose performance involves such violation would be unenforceable by any party to the agreement unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. In addition, such a finding would constitute an
Event of Default under the Trust Deed. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer could be materially and adversely affected. See also “Risk Factors – Issuer Reliance on Rule 3a-7”.
2.35 Legislative and regulatory actions in the United States and Europe may adversely affect the Issuer and the Notes

In Europe, the United States and elsewhere there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the banks, financial institutions and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold asset- backed securities (including the Notes), and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and none of the Issuer, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Investment Manager, the Trustee nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the regulatory capital treatment of their investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
No representation is made as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. Certain regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire the Notes, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the Notes who are not subject to those provisions to resell their Notes in the secondary market.
2.36 The Dodd-Frank Act

In response to the recent downturn in the credit markets and the global economic crisis, various agencies and regulatory bodies of the United States federal government and in Europe have taken or are considering taking actions to address the financial crisis. In the United States, these actions include, but are not limited to, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law on 21 July 2010, and which imposes a new regulatory framework over the U.S. financial services industry and the consumer credit markets in general, and proposed and actual regulations by the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) that, if enacted and/or implemented as currently anticipated, would significantly alter the manner in which asset-backed securities, including securities similar to the Notes, are issued and structured and increase the reporting obligations of the issuers and asset managers of such securities. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the businesses of the Investment Manager and its subsidiaries and Affiliates and the Issuer will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway outside the United States. Certain of these efforts overlap with the substantive provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others, such as proposals for financial transaction and/or bank taxes in particular countries or regions, do not. In addition, even where these United States and international regulatory efforts overlap, these efforts generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis. Areas where divergence between United States regulators and their international counterparts exists or has begun to develop (whether with respect to scope, interpretation, timing, approach or otherwise) includes trading, clearing and reporting requirements for derivatives transactions, different United States capital and margin requirements relating to uncleared derivatives transactions, and capital and liquidity requirements that may result in mandatory “ring-fencing” of capital or liquidity in certain jurisdictions, among others. Investors should be aware that those risks are material and that the Issuer and/or Merrill Lynch International and/or the Investment Manager and/or the Retention Holder could be materially and adversely affected thereby. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has promulgated a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with Hedge Agreements that may be entered into by the Issuer
from time to time. Some or all of the Hedge Agreements may be affected by requirements for central clearing with a derivatives clearinghouse organisation, by initial and variation margin requirements of clearing organisations or otherwise required by law, reporting obligations in respect of Hedge Agreements, documentation responsibilities, and other matters that may significantly increase costs to the Issuer and/or the Investment Manager, lead to the Issuer’s inability to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations or have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Investment Manager or have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders. In addition, recently adopted CFTC rules under the Dodd-Frank Act include “swaps” along with “commodities” as contracts which if traded by an entity may cause that entity to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Investment Manager to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) or “commodity trading advisor” (“CTA”). Although the CFTC has recently provided guidance that certain securitisation transactions, including CLOs, will be excluded from the definition of “commodity pool”, it is unclear if such exclusion will apply to all CLOs, and in certain instances, the investment manager of a securitisation vehicle may be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association or apply for an exemption from registration. The Investment Manager shall only permit the Issuer to enter into Hedge Agreements that: (a) either (i) comply with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) in respect of which, the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable international legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement will not in respect of a CPO, and should not in respect of a CTA, cause the Issuer, its directors or officers, or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer; and (b) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, either (i) comply with the Trading Requirements and the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) in respect of which the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable international legal counsel that the acquisition of or entry into such Hedge Agreement will not eliminate the Issuer’s ability to rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act. See further “Hedging Arrangements”.
The requirements of any exemption from regulation of the Investment Manager as a CPO with respect to the Issuer could cause the Issuer or the Investment Manager to be subject to registration and reporting requirements that may involve material costs to the Issuer. The scope of the requirements described above and related compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. While the Issuer may be excluded from the definition of “commodity pool” or the Investment Manager may satisfy the requirements of an exemption from the registration requirements described above, the conditions of any such exclusion or exemption may constrain the extent to which the Issuer may be able to enter into swap transactions. In particular, the limits imposed by such exclusion or exemptions or by the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria may prevent the Issuer from entering into a Hedge Agreement that the Investment Manager believes would be advisable or result in the Issuer incurring financial risks that would have been hedged absent such limits.
Given the broad scope and sweeping nature of these changes and the fact that final implementing rules and regulations have not yet been enacted, the potential impact of these actions on the Issuer, any of the Notes or any of the Noteholders is unknown, and no assurance can be made that the impact of such changes would not have a material adverse effect on the prospects of the Issuer or the value or marketability of the Notes. In particular, no assurance can be given that a Hedge Agreement which complies with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria or the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) will not cause the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register as a CPO and/or a CTA with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer. Furthermore, once the final rules and regulations have been enacted or if there is any change in the rules and regulations in the future, the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria or the Trading Requirements may need to be reviewed and revised by reputable legal counsel at such time.
If transactions are not exempted from any such new rules or regulations, the costs of compliance with such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Noteholders. If the Issuer were unable to comply with such rules and regulations (because of excessive cost, unavailability of information or otherwise), an Event of Default could result. Liquidation of the Collateral as a result of an Event of Default could have a material adverse effect on the Noteholders, particularly holders of the Subordinated Notes.
In addition, proposed rules regarding risk retention by sponsors of asset-backed securities could potentially limit the ability of the Issuer to issue additional Notes or undertake any Refinancing. Furthermore, no assurance can be made
that the United States federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to the economic crisis or otherwise, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.
2.37 The Volcker Rule

Final rules implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) have been adopted and become effective on 21 July 2015. As of that date and thereafter the Volcker Rule would generally prohibit covered banking entities and other entities subject to the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker Rule. The Transaction Documents have been drafted in a manner intended to exclude the Issuer from both the Commodity Exchange Act definition of “commodity pool operator” and the Investment Company Act definition of “investment company” under an exemption thereunder other than those provided in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof (specifically, Rule 3a-7 thereunder) in order that the Issuer not fall within the definition of “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will comply with Rule 3a-7 at all times, and the Issuer has the right under the Transaction Documents to cease relying on Rule 3a-7 at any time; accordingly, the Issuer may become a “covered fund” in the future. If the Issuer were to be or become a “covered fund”, then covered banking entities and other entities subject to the Volcker Rule would be restricted from acquiring and retaining certain ownership interests in the Issuer. The Volcker Rule and interpretations thereunder are still uncertain, may restrict or discourage the acquisition of Notes by such entities, and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes. Although the Volcker Rule provides limited exceptions and exemptions to its prohibitions, each investor in the Notes must make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether its investment in the Notes would or could in the future be restricted or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. Investors in the Notes are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager, the Trustee or any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Closing Date or at any time in the future.
2.38 Risk retention

On 16 April 2013, the European Parliament adopted a new directive and a regulation, Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (the “CRR”), which was published in the Official Journal on 27 June 2013 and which took effect on 1 January 2014. Articles 404 - 410 (inclusive) of the CRR (“Article 404”) replaced and, in certain respects differ from, the previous requirements in Article 122a of the Capital Requirements Directive that applied prior to 1 January 2014. On 22 May 2013, the European Banking Authority (formerly known as the Committee of European Banking Supervisors) (the “EBA”) published a consultation paper on draft regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards regarding the securitisation retention rules and related requirements under Article 404 which were the subject of a public consultation during 2013. On 17 December 2013, the final draft regulatory technical standards and final draft implementing technical standards (the “RTS” and, together with Article 404 and any guidelines and technical standards published in relation thereto by the EBA or adopted by the European Commission as may be effective from time to time, the “CRR Retention Requirements”), were submitted by the EBA to the European Commission.
The CRR Retention Requirements apply to credit institutions and investment firms established in a member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and consolidated group affiliates thereof (including those that are based outside of the EEA) that invest in or have an exposure to credit risk in securitisations and in particular, in new securitisations issued after 31 December 2010 (each an “Affected CRR Investor”). The CRR Retention Requirements impose an increased capital charge on a securitisation position acquired by an Affected CRR Investor unless, among other conditions: (a) the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than 5 per cent. in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or asset exposures; and (b) the Affected CRR Investor is able to demonstrate that it has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of its securitisation position and the underlying exposures and that procedures are established for monitoring the performance of the underlying exposures on an on- going basis.
On 22 July 2013, European Union Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) became effective. Article 17 of AIFMD required the EU Commission to adopt level 2 measures similar to those in the CRR Retention Requirements, allowing EEA managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFMs”) to invest in securitisations on behalf of the alternative investment funds they manage only if the originator, sponsor or original lender has explicitly disclosed that it will retain on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. of the nominal value of the securitised exposures or of the tranches sold to investors and also to undertake certain due diligence requirements. Though the AIFMD Retention Requirements are similar to the CRR Retention Requirements, they are not identical. In particular, the AIFMD Retention Requirements require AIFMs to ensure that the sponsor or originator of a securitisation meets certain underwriting and originating criteria in granting credit, and imposes more extensive due diligence requirements on AIFMs investing in securitisations than are imposed on credit institutions under the CRR Retention Requirements. Furthermore, AIFMs who discover after the assumption of a securitisation exposure that the retained interest does not meet the requirements, or subsequently falls below five per cent. of the economic risk, are required to take such corrective action as is in the best interests of investors. It remains to be seen how this last requirement is expected to be addressed by AIFMs should those circumstances arise. The AIFMD Retention Requirements apply to new securitisations issued on or after 1 January 2011.
Requirements similar to the CRR Retention Requirements and the AIFMD Retention Requirements (together the “Retention Requirements”) will apply to investments in securitisations by other types of EEA investors such as EEA insurance and reinsurance undertakings (when the directive known as Solvency II comes into force) and also (once level 2 measures are adopted under Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (the “UCITS Directive”), by funds which require authorisation under the UCITS Directive (all of which, together with AIFMs and Affected CRR Investors, are “Affected Investors”). Though many aspects of the detail and effect of all of these requirements remain unclear, the Retention Requirements, Solvency II, the UCITS Directive and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of securitisations or of the Notes for some or all Affected Investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual Noteholders and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.
Affected Investors should therefore make themselves aware of the requirements of the applicable legislation governing retention and due diligence requirements for investing in securitisations (and any implementing rules in relation to a relevant jurisdiction) in addition to any other regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Notes.
Each Affected Investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in “The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements”, information elsewhere in this Offering Circular generally and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements. Affected Investors are required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of such information. None of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger. the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes and the transactions described herein are compliant with the Retention Requirements, Solvency II, the UCITS Directive or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements and no such Person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements. If a regulator determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Retention Requirements, Solvency II, the UCITS Directive or any applicable legal, regulatory or other requirement, then if an investor is an Affected Investor it may be required by its regulator to set aside additional capital against its investment in the Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of its investment in the Notes.
With respect to the fulfilment by the Investment Manager of the Retention Requirements, please refer to “The Retention Holder and Retention Requirements” section of this Offering Circular.
2.39 CRA3

On 13 May 2013, the finalised text of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) was published. CRA3 became effective on
20 June 2013 (the “CRA3 Effective Date”). CRA3 provides, inter alia, for certain additional disclosure requirements which will be applicable in relation to structured finance transactions on an ongoing basis. Such disclosures will need to be made via a website to be set up by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). The scope and manner of such disclosure will be subject to regulatory technical standards. The regulatory technical standards have not yet been published by ESMA and it is anticipated that they will be published in draft form within a year of the CRA3 Effective Date. Subsequently they will be subject to a consultation period. It is not possible for the Issuer or any other party to comply with the disclosure requirements until such time as the regulatory technical standards are made available. Additionally, CRA3 has introduced a requirement that issuers or related third parties of structured finance instruments solicit two independent ratings for their obligations; and should consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share. At this time, it is not possible for the Issuer to comply with some of these requirements. The Issuer has appointed the Rating Agencies as independent rating agencies to rate each Class of Rated Note. The Issuer considered appointing a rating agency with no more than ten per cent. of the total market share but determined not to do so. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 in respect of their investment in the Notes.
2.40 Rights of Retention Holder

The Retention Holder has rights as to Optional Redemption of the Notes as further outlined at “The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class”. In addition, the Retention Holder has approval rights in relation to the additional issuances of Notes (see Condition 17(a) (Additional Issuances)), as well as veto rights over any modifications to the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Reinvestment Criteria (see “- Resolutions, amendments and waivers” and Condition 14(b)(ix) (Retention Holder Veto)).
The Retention Holder has no duty or obligation to consider the interests of any other Noteholders when exercising the above rights nor does the Retention Holder owe any fiduciary duties to the Issuer, the Noteholders or any other party.
No assurance can be made as to whether the Retention Holder will exercise its rights under the Conditions of the Notes in a manner favourable to the holders of any Class of Notes.
2.41 EMIR

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) entered into force on 16 August 2012. EMIR aims to increase stability in OTC derivatives markets and includes measures to require the clearing of certain OTC derivatives through central clearing counterparties and to increase the transparency of OTC derivatives. EMIR introduces certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts entered into by certain financial counterparties (“FCs”), such as European investment firms, alternative investment funds, credit institutions and insurance companies, and counterparties that are not FCs (“NFCs”).
In connection with EMIR, various technical standards have now come into force, however, certain critical technical standards remain outstanding, including those addressing which classes of over the counter (“OTC”) derivative contracts will be subject to the clearing obligation and the scope of collateralisation obligations in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared. FCs will be subject to a general obligation to clear all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”), to report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”) and undertake certain risk mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not subject to the clearing obligation, such as the timely confirmation of the terms of the OTC derivative contracts, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures.
NFCs are subject to reporting and certain risk mitigation obligations. NFCs are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations, such as the posting of collateral, as long as they do not exceed the applicable clearing thresholds established by the regulatory technical standard for the relevant class of OTC derivative contracts. OTC derivative contracts which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly related to commercial activity or treasury financing activity of an NFC or the group to which it belongs (the “hedging exemption”) will not be included towards the clearing thresholds. If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, amongst other events, result from the accounting consolidation of the Issuer by Alcentra Limited or its Affiliates due to a change in law, accounting rules or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting rules) or otherwise no longer makes use of the hedging exemption, there is a risk that OTC derivative contracts it enters into will become subject to the clearing obligation and such additional risk mitigation obligations. It may not be possible for the Issuer to know if any of the thresholds have been exceeded or if it has become part of a “group” for the purposes of EMIR and this status in any event may be subject to change. In the event that the Issuer exceeds the applicable clearing thresholds, it would be required to post collateral both in respect of cleared and non-cleared OTC derivative contracts. In such instance, it is unlikely that the Issuer would be able to comply with such requirements. In such circumstances, hedge counterparties may be unable to enter into hedge transactions with the Issuer and may have the right to terminate existing hedge transactions. This could result in the sale of Asset Swap Obligations and/or the termination of relevant Hedge Transactions and/or limit the Issuer’s ability to invest in Non-Euro Obligations or may result in it being in breach of its obligations to enter into Asset Swap Transactions with respect to any Non-Euro Obligations it has purchased. The Issuer may also be exposed to interest rate risk and currency risk as further described below (see “Interest rate risk” and “Currency risk and Asset Swap Transactions” below). The Conditions of the Notes permit the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable at a future date. Further regulations are expected. Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to engage in derivative contracts. As a result of such increased costs and/or increased regulatory requirements, investors may also receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be. Alternatively the regulations and/or associated costs involved could preclude the Investment Manager from being able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated, investors should be aware that such risks are material and that the Issuer could be materially and adversely affected thereby. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.
2.42 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive

The AIFMD was required to be transposed into national laws by no later than 22 July 2013, although there are transitional provisions which expire one year later on 22 July 2014. AIFMD provides, among other things, that all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) must have a designated AIFM with responsibility for portfolio and risk management. There is an exemption provided in respect of “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”). However, neither ESMA nor the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Dutch: Autoriteit Financiële Markten) has given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a CLO specifically would fall within the SSPE Exemption. If, however, AIFMD were to apply to the Issuer, the Investment Manager would need to be appropriately regulated. From the Issuer’s perspective, if the Issuer were considered to be an AIF and could not benefit from the SSPE Exemption or any other exemption, the AIFMD would require the Investment Manager and/or the Issuer to seek authorisation to become an AIFM under the AIFMD. If the Investment Manager or the Issuer were to fail to, or be unable to, obtain such authorisation, the Investment Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. Any regulatory changes arising from implementation of the AIFMD (or otherwise) that impairs the ability of the Investment Manager to manage the Issuer’s assets may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to carry out its investment strategy and achieve its investment objective. In addition, if the Issuer were an AIF it will be classified as a “financial counterparty” under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations or other risk mitigation techniques with respect to Hedge Transactions including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty. See also “Risk Factors - EMIR” above.
2.43 EU Savings Directive

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), member states are required to provide to the tax authorities of another member state details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in that other member state. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments, unless the beneficiary of the interest payments elects for the exchange of information. The end of this transitional period depends on the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries.
A number of non EU countries, including Switzerland, (“Third Countries”) and certain dependent or associated territories of certain member states (“Dependent and Associated Territories”) have adopted similar measures in relation to payments of interest or other similar income paid by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in another member state, or certain Third Countries or Dependent and Associated Territories. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic exchange under the EU Savings Directive.
The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the EU Savings Directive which may, if implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.
If a payment were to be made or collected through a member state which operates a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor any Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. Pursuant to Condition 8(d) (Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agents), so long as such a jurisdiction exists, the Issuer is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a member state that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to confirm to, the EU Savings Directive.
2.44 Book-entry holders are not considered Noteholders under the Trust Deed and may delay receipt of payments on the Notes

Holders of beneficial interests in any Notes held in global form will not be considered holders of such Notes under the Trust Deed. After payment of any interest, principal or other amount to the applicable Clearing System, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of such amount by the applicable Clearing System or to any holder of a beneficial interest in a Note. The applicable Clearing System or its nominee will be the sole holder for any Notes held in global form, and therefore each Person owning a beneficial interest in a Note held in global form must rely on the procedures of such Clearing System (and if such Person is not a participant in the applicable Clearing System on the procedures of the participant through which such Person holds such interest) with respect to the exercise of any rights of a Noteholder under the Trust Deed.
Noteholders owning a book-entry Note may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions of interest and principal on such Note since distributions are required to be forwarded by the Principal Paying Agent to the applicable Clearing System, and the applicable Clearing System will be required to credit such distributions to the accounts of its participants which thereafter will be required to credit them to the accounts of the applicable Noteholders, either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. See “Form of the Notes”.
2.45 Security

Clearing Systems

Collateral Debt Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear (the “Euroclear Account”) unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared through its accounts with
Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate. Those Collateral Debt Obligations held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Debt Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Debt Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian on trust for the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities if an insolvency of the Custodian occurs.
On the Issue Date the Issuer will grant a pledge pursuant to Belgian law over the Euroclear Account (the “Euroclear Security Agreement”). The effect of this security interest will be to enable the Custodian, on enforcement, to sell the securities in the Euroclear Account on behalf of the Trustee. The Euroclear Security Agreement will not entitle the Trustee to require delivery of the relevant securities from the depositary or depositaries that have physical custody of such securities or allow the Trustee to dispose of such securities directly.
In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Debt Obligations comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Debt Obligations.
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with Collateral Debt Obligations comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Trustee, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.
Fixed Security

Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
2.46 Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.
Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that as a result of the recent economic events, rating agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.
The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any such new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Rated Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, Noteholders may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.
As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under the CRA. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under the CRA and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
In addition to the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by the Rating Agencies, the Issuer will be utilising ratings assigned by rating agencies to Obligors of individual Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Impaired Obligation, an S&P CCC Obligation, a Moody’s Caa Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore subject to various haircuts to the Principal Balance thereof). The Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating. In most instances, the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Debt Obligation. In most cases, the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating in respect of a Collateral Debt Obligation will be based on a confidential credit estimate determined separately by S&P and/or Moody’s. Such confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Investment Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different Rating Agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Investment Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that may be made up of Collateral Debt Obligations where the Moody’s Rating is derived from an S&P Rating or the S&P Rating is derived from a Moody’s Rating. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Debt Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Debt Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model- derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Debt Obligation in question. Please see “The Portfolio” and “Ratings of the Notes”.
There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Debt Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of S&P CCC Obligations and/or Moody’s Caa Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations

Historically, many actions by issuers of CLO notes (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the trust deed and the other transaction documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by Noteholders.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Investment Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if S&P does not confirm its initial ratings of the applicable Rated Notes or if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, the applicable Rated Notes may be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide any rating confirmation upon request or that the Effective Date Moody’s Condition will be able to be satisfied, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value of liquidity of the Notes.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the arranger

On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product such as this transaction paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.
Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes, as applicable. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The unsolicited ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any unsolicited rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Such unsolicited ratings could have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not intended that a report of any independent accountants will be required to be provided to, or will otherwise be shared with, a Rating Agency and it is not intended that such report would be posted to the website maintained for the purposes of compliance with Rule 17g-5.
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.
2.47 Financial information provided to Noteholders in the Monthly Report and the Payment Date Report will be unaudited

On a monthly basis, excluding any month for which a Payment Date Report has been prepared, the Collateral Administrator on behalf, and at the expense, of the Issuer and in consultation with the Investment Manager shall compile and make available to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Investment Manager, the Initial Purchaser, any Hedge Counterparty, each Rating Agency and any Noteholder by means of a secured website, a monthly report (the “Monthly Report”), which shall be accessible by way of a unique password, setting forth certain information with respect to the Portfolio in respect of the immediately preceding month, including certain loss and delinquency information on the Collateral Debt Obligations, details of each of the Accounts, the Liquidity Facility, the Hedge Transactions, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and confirmation relating to risk retention of the Retention Holder. In preparing and furnishing the Monthly Reports, the Collateral Administrator will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of certain information or data regarding the Collateral Debt Obligations that has been provided to it by the Investment Manager, and the Collateral Administrator will not verify, recompute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data. Not later than one Business Day preceding the related Payment Date, the Collateral Administrator on behalf, and at the expense, of the Issuer and in consultation with the Investment Manager shall prepare and make available to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Investment Manager, the Initial Purchaser, any Hedge Counterparty, each Rating Agency and any Noteholder by means of a secured website, a report which shall be accessible by way of a unique password, containing all the information in a Monthly Report reported for the full Accrual Period as well as setting forth, among other things, certain information as to the distributions being made on such Payment Date, the fees to be paid to the Investment Manager and the Trustee and the loss and delinquency status of the Collateral Debt Obligations (the “Payment Date Report”). Each of these Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports will state that it is for the purposes of information only, that certain information included in the report is estimated, approximated or projected and that it is provided without any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness thereof and that none of the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Issuer or the Investment Manager will have any liability for estimates, approximations or projections contained therein. Neither such information nor any other financial information furnished to Noteholders will be audited and reported upon, and an opinion will not be expressed, by an independent public accountant.
2.48 Anti-money laundering, corruption, bribery and similar laws may require certain actions or disclosures

Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti- corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “Requirements”). Any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager or the Trustee could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager and the Trustee will comply with Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. Failure to honour any request by the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager or the Trustee to provide requested
information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager or the Trustee to comply with any Requirements, related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or informal) may result in, among other things, a forced sale to another investor of such investor’s Notes. In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Investment Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith.
2.49 Resolutions, amendments and waivers

The Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions of the Notes and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below, however all of the following discussion is subject to the provision in Condition 14(b)(ix) (Retention Holder Veto), that if at any time neither the Retention Holder nor an Affiliate of the Retention Holder is the Investment Manager and provided that no Retention Event has occurred and is continuing, no modification or any Resolution to approve the modification of the Eligibility Criteria, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests, the Reinvestment Criteria or any changes to any of them will be effective without the consent in writing of the Retention Holder.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution (as applicable), in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods. The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.
If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the total amount of Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote which are present at such meeting and not by the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes which are entitled to be voted in respect of such Resolution. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are, however, quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution (as applicable). In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, if a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed. However, no Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution may be passed without meeting the “Minimum Percentage Voting Requirements” set out in Condition 14(b)(iii) (Minimum Voting Rights). Each Hedge Counterparty will also need to be notified and its consent obtained (unless not required by virtue of the expiry of a notice period set out in the relevant Hedge Agreement) in respect of any proposed modification, amendment or supplement to certain provisions of the Transaction Documents specified in the applicable Hedge Agreement. Any such consent, if withheld in accordance with the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement, may prevent the Transaction Documents from being modified in a manner which may be beneficial to Noteholders.
Certain entrenched rights relating to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes including (but not limited to) the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution, cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders. In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, modifications may also be made and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters which the Trustee is obliged to consent to without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders or the Trustee. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders.
2.50 Concentrated ownership of one or more Classes of Notes

If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Investment Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of Noteholders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes.
2.51 Flip clauses

The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment (such as the Priorities of Payment) which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgment of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard. In 2012, a new suit was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court by claimants in the Belmont case asking, among other things, for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognise and enforce the decision of the English Supreme Court and to declare that flip clauses are enforceable under U.S. bankruptcy law notwithstanding that court’s earlier decision. Plaintiffs in that suit have also filed a companion motion alleging that the issues in their complaint are tangential to the bankruptcy before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and that, therefore, the suit should be removed to a U.S. district court. Given the current state of U.S. bankruptcy and English law, this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the “anti-deprivation” principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is
not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to any Hedge Counterparty would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
2.52 The proposed Financial Transaction Tax

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “participating Member States”).
The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under current proposals the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including
(a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
2.53 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform

Proposals to Reform LIBOR

The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) is currently being reformed, including by: (a) the replacement of the BBA as LIBOR administrator, (b) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and (c) changes in the way that LIBOR is calculated, by compelling more banks to provide LIBOR submissions and basing these submissions on actual transaction data. Investors should be aware that: (a) any of these changes or any other changes to LIBOR could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; (b) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a currency or tenor which is discontinued: (i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and (ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Debt Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay to a Hedge Counterparty under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Debt Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the applicable Hedge Agreements, and potential termination of the applicable Hedge Agreements; and (c) the administrator of LIBOR will not have any involvement in the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of LIBOR without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes. Any of the above or any other significant change to the setting of LIBOR could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a LIBOR rate; and (ii) the Notes.
Proposals to Reform EURIBOR and other Benchmark Indices

The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this paragraph only, “EURIBOR” and other so called “benchmarks” are the subject of proposals for reform by a number of international authorities and other bodies. In September 2013, the European Commission published a proposed regulation (the “Proposed Benchmark Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The date the Proposed Benchmark Regulation will come into force is not yet clear. The Proposed Benchmark Regulation will, if enacted, make significant changes to the way in which EURIBOR is calculated, including detailed codes of conduct for contributors and transparency requirements applying to contributions of data. Benchmarks such as EURIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with these requirements or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator. Investors should be aware that: (a) any of these changes or any other changes to EURIBOR could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; (b) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Debt Obligation is calculated with reference to a EURIBOR currency or tenor which is discontinued, such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Debt Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; (c) if the EURIBOR benchmark referenced in the Conditions of the Notes is discontinued, interest on the Notes will be calculated on the alternative basis set out in Condition 6 (Interest); and (d) the administrator of EURIBOR will not have any involvement in the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of EURIBOR without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Debt Obligations or the Notes. Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable) and (ii) the Notes.
2.54 Application of certain amounts may affect the performance of the Notes

At any time during or after the Reinvestment Period, Contributions received into the Contribution Account, may be directed to be applied as Principal Proceeds by the related Contributor (or, if no direction is given by the Contributor, by the Investment Manager at its reasonable discretion). If such amounts are deposited into the Interest Account, such deposit may, among other things, temporarily prevent deferral of interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes or cause an Interest Coverage Test to pass. If such amounts are deposited into the Principal Account, such deposit may, among other things, be reinvested into additional Collateral Debt Obligations or repaid to holders of Rated Notes as a Special Redemption Amount. Any such deposit could have the effect of causing a Coverage Test to pass or modify the effect of events that would otherwise give rise to an Event of Default and permit the Controlling Class to exercise remedies under the Conditions of the Notes. If such amounts are used to repurchase Rated Notes, such deposit would cause Rated Notes to be repaid early and there can be no assurance that the Rated Notes so repaid will not be held by a Contributor, the Investment Manager or any of their respective affiliates.
2.55 Failure of a court to enforce non-petition obligations will adversely affect Noteholders

Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, then the filing or presentation of such a petition could result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such filing being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s insolvent estate. It could also result in an insolvency or bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed.
2.56 Limited control of administration and amendment of Collateral

As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Investment Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Portfolio or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of
care specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Investment Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The Investment Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
2.57 Voting restrictions on syndicated loans for minority holders

The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any asset forming part of the Portfolio issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.
2.58 International investing

The assets comprising the Portfolio will consist of obligations of, or securities issued by, obligors organised under the laws of a variety of different countries. Investing in certain countries may involve greater risks than investing in other countries, including: (a) less publicly available information; (b) varying levels of governmental regulation and supervision; (c) the difficulty of enforcing legal rights in a foreign jurisdiction and uncertainties as to the status, interpretation and application of laws; and (d) foreign exchange controls. Moreover accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Different markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, which could create delays in the purchase and sale of assets forming part of the Portfolio. Delays in settlement could result in periods when assets of the Issuer are uninvested or invested in short term investments with low yields. The inability to sell assets due to settlement problems could result in losses due to subsequent declines in the value of the assets.
3. Relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations

3.1 The Portfolio

The decision by any prospective Noteholder to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Investment Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and the Reinvestment Criteria, where applicable) which each Collateral Debt Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied as at the Determination Date preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Debt Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Investment Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.
Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser has made or will make any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Custodian, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their Affiliates is under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Debt Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, any Hedge Counterparty, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.
Unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be made upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Manager will be restricted from causing the Issuer to acquire any Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment which is not an “eligible asset” under Rule 3a-7. The Collateral Debt Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities or Eligible Investments being acquired or disposed of by the Issuer will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. The acquisition or disposition of any Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Eligible Investment may not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the then-current rating issued by the Rating Agencies on any Class of Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes). Until the Issuer elects to rely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, the Investment Manager will also be restricted from causing the Issuer to dispose of any Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Eligible Investment or acquire any Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment for the primary purpose of recognising gains or decreasing losses resulting from market value changes. These restrictions mean that the Issuer may be required to hold a Collateral Debt Obligation or and Eligible Investment or be precluded from acquiring a Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment when it would have sold such Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment or acquired such Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment, as applicable, had it based such determination on expected market value changes. As a result, greater losses on the Portfolio may be sustained and there may be insufficient proceeds on any Payment Date to pay in full any expenses of the Issuer or any amounts payable prior to payments in respect of the principal of and interest on the Notes. See “Risk Factors – Relating to the Notes - Issuer Reliance on Rule 3a-7”.
3.2 Nature of Collateral; defaults

The Issuer will invest in a portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations consisting at the time of acquisition of predominantly Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations, High Yield Bonds, as well as certain other investments, all of which will have greater credit and liquidity risk than investment grade sovereign or corporate bonds or loans. The Collateral is subject to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant borrower or issuer, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio”.
Due to the fact that the Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations, it is anticipated that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations.
The offering of the Notes has been structured so that the Notes are assumed to be able to withstand certain assumed losses relating to defaults on the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations. See “Ratings of the Notes”. There is no assurance that actual losses will not exceed such assumed losses. If any losses exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by such defaults. To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation securing the Notes and the Issuer sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Debt Obligation, it is likely that the proceeds of such sale or disposition will be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon.
The financial markets periodically experience substantial fluctuations in prices for obligations of the types that may be Collateral Debt Obligations and limited liquidity for such obligations. No assurance can be made that the conditions giving rise to such price fluctuations and limited liquidity will not occur, subsist or become more acute following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the ability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations at a price and time that the Investment Manager deems advantageous may be impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is either unable to dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices have risen or to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations whose prices are on the increase; the Investment Manager’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets will conversely cause their net asset value to decline as the value of unsold positions is marked to lower prices. A decrease in the Market Value of the Collateral Debt Obligations would also adversely affect the proceeds of sale that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Debt Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.
3.3 Below investment-grade Collateral Debt Obligations involve particular risks

The Collateral Debt Obligations will consist primarily of non-investment grade loans or interests in non-investment grade loans, which are subject to liquidity, market value, credit, interest rate, reinvestment and certain other risks. It is anticipated that the Collateral Debt Obligations generally will be subject to greater risks than investment grade corporate obligations. These risks could be exacerbated to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in one or more particular types of Collateral Debt Obligations.
Prices of the Collateral Debt Obligations may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, prevailing credit spreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Obligors of the Collateral Debt Obligations. The current uncertainty affecting the European economy and the economies of countries in which issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the value and performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations. Additionally, loans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organised exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customised, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the debt securities market.
Leveraged loans have historically experienced greater default rates than has been the case for investment grade securities. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the Collateral Debt Obligations, and an increase in default levels could adversely affect payments on the Notes.
A non-investment grade loan, bond or other debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial work out negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in substantial uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal to either the minimum recovery rate assumed by either S&P or Moody’s in rating the Rated Notes or any recovery rate used in connection with any analysis of the Notes that may have been prepared by any person for or at the direction of Noteholders.
3.4 Credit ratings are not a guarantee of quality or performance

Credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations represent the rating agencies’ opinions regarding their credit quality and are not a guarantee of quality or performance. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Collateral Debt Obligations and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a rating assigned to any Collateral Debt Obligation is lowered for any reason, no party is obliged to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Collateral Debt Obligation. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future creditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, liquidity risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an Obligor’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating indicates. Consequently, credit ratings of any Collateral Debt Obligation (as is also the case in respect of the Rated Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of investment quality and should not be considered a completely reliable indicator of investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous Collateral Debt Obligations at a single time or within a short period of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of Collateral Debt Obligations included in or similar to the Collateral Debt Obligations will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward. See “Risk Factors – Relating to the Notes - Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes”.
3.5 The Issuer may acquire certain Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date

It is expected that approximately €300 million in aggregate principal amount of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations will be acquired or committed to be acquired by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) as of the Issue Date at prevailing market prices at the time of purchase by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer).
The Issuer’s purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date may be financed by a warehouse financing facility (the “Warehouse Facility”) provided by (a) Bank of America N.A., London Branch (“BANA”), as senior lender and senior agent together with (b) a third party or third parties as purchaser(s) of certain warehouse loans (a “Warehouse Equity Purchasers”). If a Warehouse Facility has been entered into, then upon the occurrence of the Issue Date, it will terminate and BANA will be paid in full from the issuance proceeds received by the Issuer for the Notes. All net realised losses and all unrealised losses with respect to the initial Collateral Debt Obligations will be for the Issuer’s account and, consequently, the market value of such Collateral Debt Obligations on the Issue Date may be lower (or higher) than at the time they were acquired by the Issuer. If the issuance of the Notes does not occur, the initial Collateral Debt Obligations may be liquidated and BANA and/or the Warehouse Equity Purchasers may suffer a loss. This risk may provide an incentive for the Arranger, Initial Purchaser and the Investment Manager to close the transaction in non-optimal conditions.
As a senior lender and senior agent in connection with a Warehouse Facility, BANA would have the right to approve all Collateral Debt Obligations acquired by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) and, in certain circumstances, would have the right to require or approve sales of Collateral Debt Obligations by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer). If applicable, BANA will exercise those rights solely for its own benefit as a senior lender and/or senior agent and in a manner that protects its rights and interests as a creditor of the Issuer. None of BANA, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates has done, and no such person will do, any analysis of the Collateral Debt Obligations acquired or sold by the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) for the benefit of, or in a manner designed to further the interests of, any Noteholder. By its purchase of Notes, each Noteholder is deemed to have consented on behalf of itself to the purchase of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer and the arrangements described above.
Prior to the Issue Date, amongst other sources, the Issuer may acquire, or enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance of approximately 50 per cent. of the Target Par Amount from funds or other CLOs in relation to which Alcentra Limited, or any of its Affiliates, may be the investment manager or may exercise investment discretion in relation thereto. See further “Risk Factors – Relating to certain Conflicts of Interest – Investment Manager”.


3.6 Noteholders will receive limited disclosure about the Collateral Debt Obligations

Neither the Issuer nor the Investment Manager will provide the Noteholders or the Trustee with financial or other information (which may include material non-public information) it receives pursuant to the Collateral Debt Obligations and related documents unless required to do so pursuant to the Trust Deed or the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The Investment Manager also will not disclose to any of these parties the contents of any notice it receives pursuant to the Collateral Debt Obligations or related documents unless required to do so pursuant to the Trust Deed or the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document. In particular, the Investment Manager will not have any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligations, except as may be required in connection with the regular reports prepared by the Issuer (or the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trust Deed.
The Noteholders, the Collateral Administrator and the Trustee will not have any right to inspect any records relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations, and the Investment Manager will not be obliged to disclose any further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Debt Obligations, unless (a) specifically required by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document or (b) following its receipt of a written request from the Trustee, the Investment Manager in its sole discretion determines that the disclosure of such further information or evidence regarding the existence or terms of, or the identity of any Obligor on, any Collateral Debt Obligation to the Trustee would not be prohibited by applicable law or the underlying instruments relating to such Collateral Debt Obligation, in which case the Investment Manager will disclose such further information or evidence to the Trustee; provided that (a) the Trustee will not disclose such further information or evidence to any third party except (i) to the extent disclosure may be required by law or any governmental or regulatory authority and (ii) to the extent that the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations under the Trust Deed. Furthermore, the Investment Manager may, with respect to any information that it elects to disclose, demand that Persons receiving such information execute confidentiality agreements before being provided with the information.
3.7 Lender liability considerations and equitable subordination can affect the Issuer’s rights with respect to Collateral Debt Obligations

A number of judicial decisions in the United States of America and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability”. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing, or a similar duty owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of lender liability theories, because of the nature of the Portfolio, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Investment Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.
In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the undercapitalization of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors,
(c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a shareholder or stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Debt Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Investment Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine. The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Debt Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may
impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.
3.8 Reinvestment risk / uninvested cash balances

To the extent that the Investment Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.
During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Investment Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Debt Obligations and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable). After giving effect to any such disposal, the Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding of all Collateral Debt Obligations (other than Credit Improved Obligations, Credit Impaired Obligations, Defaulted Obligations or an Exchanged Equity Securities) sold during the preceding twelve calendar months (or, for the first twelve calendar months after the Issue Date, during the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the date of determination) cannot be greater than 30 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of such twelve calendar month period (or as of the Issue Date, as the case may be). In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Debt Obligations prepay or mature prior to the stated Maturity Date, the Investment Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Investment Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Collateral. Any decrease in the yield on the Collateral will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that if Collateral Debt Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Debt Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations.
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to the Noteholders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Debt Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Debt Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase
the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Debt Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Debt Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Debt Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.
3.9 Loan prepayments may affect the ability of the Issuer to invest and reinvest available funds in appropriate Collateral Debt Obligations

Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the Obligor thereof at par plus accrued unpaid interest thereon. Prepayments on loans may be caused by a variety of factors which are often difficult to predict. Consequently, there exists a risk that loans purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, principal proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk during the Reinvestment Period. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria specified herein may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Rated Notes and the distributions on the Subordinated Notes. There is no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates at favourable prices that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made. The rate of prepayments, amortisation and defaults may be influenced by various factors including (but not limited to):
 changes in Obligor performance and requirements for capital;
 the level of interest rates;
 lack of credit being extended and/or the tightening of credit underwriting standards in the commercial lending industry; and
 the overall economic environment, including any fluctuations in the recovery from the current economic conditions.
The Issuer cannot predict the actual rate of prepayments, accelerated amortisation or defaults which will be experienced with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations. As a result, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for any investor that requires a regular or predictable schedule of principal payments.
3.10 The Issuer may not be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria

A portion of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations is expected to be purchased after the Issue Date as described herein. The ability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire an initial portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfies the Eligibility Criteria at the projected prices, ratings, rates of interest and any other applicable characteristics will be subject to market conditions and availability of such Collateral Debt Obligations. Any inability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria specified herein may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Rated Notes and the distributions on the Subordinated Notes. There is no assurance that the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer will be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria.
3.11 Characteristics and risks relating to the Portfolio

Characteristics of Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations

The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, not less than 90 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance must consist of Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds in aggregate (which shall comprise for this purpose the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions or obligor capital structures, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or share or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Loans or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Loans and Secured Senior Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred shares or stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Secured Senior Loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.
Secured Senior Bonds (other than floating rate notes) typically bear interest at a fixed rate. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Risk Factors – Relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations - Interest rate risk” below. Additionally, Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.
Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the Obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), they will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of such an obligation not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.
The majority of Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.
Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the obligations. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate or bondholders normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan or bond. However, although any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans or bonds and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.
Limited liquidity, prepayment and default risk in relation to Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations

In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement including such Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Senior Loan.
Increased risks for Mezzanine Obligations

The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Loan and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Loans. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.
Prepayment risk

Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or make whole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations with comparable interest rates that satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.
Defaults and recoveries

There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Mezzanine Obligations and Second Lien Loans and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond, Mezzanine Obligation or Second Lien Loan often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Loan, Secured Senior Bond, Mezzanine Obligation or Second Lien Loan will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Mezzanine Obligations and Second Lien Loans may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
The effects of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default are uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative investment managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Loans and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.
A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Debt Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial work out negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, an extension of the maturity and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes.
In some European jurisdictions, obligors or lenders may seek a “scheme of arrangement”. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. Recoveries on Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks

The Issuer or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Debt Obligations which are Cov- Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have Maintenance Covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have Maintenance Covenants. In addition, the lack of Maintenance Covenants may make it more difficult to trigger a default in respect of such obligations.
Characteristics and risks associated with investing in High Yield Bonds and unsecured obligations involves certain risks

High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable Obligor and generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with investment grade obligations and secured obligations. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for High Yield Bonds. High Yield Bonds are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the issuers incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they had previously operated. The lower rating of High Yield Bonds reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of the Obligor or general economic conditions (including, for example, a substantial period of rising interest rates or declining earnings or disruptions in the financial markets) or both may impair the ability of the Obligor to make payments of principal and interest.
High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.
The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.
European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.
In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market,
leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
Unsecured loans are also unsecured obligations of the applicable Obligor, may be subordinated to other obligations of the Obligor and generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with investment grade obligations and secured obligations. Unsecured obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any unsecured obligation occurs, the holders of such unsecured obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks

The Collateral Debt Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a pledge of collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (a) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (b) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (c) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (d) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (i) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (ii) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (iii) debtor-in-possession financings.
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Debt Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Debt Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Debt Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Debt Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Debt Obligation.
Corporate Rescue Loans

Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be
required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.
Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any).
3.12 Participations, Novations and Assignments

The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Debt Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub-participation). Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub-participation are referred to herein as “Participations”. Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of Participation or acquired by way of Assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”.
The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.
Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. If an insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation occurs, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and
such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes.
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests impose limits on the amount of Collateral Debt Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Aggregate Collateral Balance. There can be no assurance that the current level of market liquidity for loans and loan participations will continue or that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide an adequate degree of liquidity. In addition, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to sell a loan or loan participation whose obligor has deteriorated in credit quality. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of assets forming part of the Portfolio at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when an asset forming part of the Portfolio is sold. Additional risks include, among others, that the prices at which an asset forming part of the Portfolio can be sold will have deteriorated from its effective purchase price, opportunities for the Issuer to sell its assets in the secondary market may be impaired, and increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in collateralised loan obligation securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect holders of the Notes. In addition, the impact of the limited liquidity may adversely affect the management flexibility of the Investment Manager in relation to the Portfolio and ultimately the returns on the Notes to investors.
3.13 Collateral Enhancement Obligations

All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of Contributions and the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Collateral Enhancement Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment is subject to the following caps: (a) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €1,000,000; and (b) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all Payment Dates may not exceed €2,000,000.
The Investment Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests.
3.14 Certain risks relating to Hedge Agreements

The payments associated with any Hedge Agreements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes. The Initial Purchaser, the Arranger and/or one or more of their respective Affiliates with acceptable credit support arrangements may act as counterparty with respect to all or some of the Hedge Agreements, which may create certain conflicts of interest. Moreover, if the insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty occurs, the Issuer will be treated as a general creditor of such Hedge Counterparty. Consequently, the Issuer will be subject to the credit risk of each Hedge Counterparty, as well as that of the related Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Hedge Agreements also pose risks upon their termination. A Hedge Counterparty may terminate the applicable Hedge Agreements upon the occurrence of certain events of default or termination events thereunder with respect to the Issuer (including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, if any withholding tax is imposed on payments thereunder by or to such Hedge Counterparty, a change in law making the performance of the obligations under such Hedge Agreement unlawful, or the determination to sell or liquidate the Collateral Debt Obligations upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Trust Deed), and in the case of such early termination of any Hedge Agreement, the Issuer may be required to make a payment to the related Hedge Counterparty. Any amounts that would be required to be paid by the Issuer to enter into replacement Hedge Agreements will reduce amounts available for payments to Noteholders. In either case, there can be no assurance that the remaining payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations would be sufficient to make payments of interest and principal on the Rated Notes and distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes.
The Issuer may terminate a Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default or termination events thereunder with respect to the Hedge Counterparty (including, but not limited to, bankruptcy or the failure of the Hedge Counterparty to make payments to the Issuer under the applicable Hedge Agreement). Even if the Issuer is the terminating party, it may owe a termination payment to the Hedge Counterparty as described in the immediately preceding paragraph. If the Issuer terminated a Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy of the applicable Hedge Counterparty, there can be no assurance that termination amounts due and payable to the Hedge Counterparty from the Issuer would be subordinated to payments made to the Noteholders as required under the Priorities of Payment. Recent decisions in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings have held that subordination provisions similar to those set forth in the Priorities of Payment are unenforceable with respect to a bankrupt hedge counterparty. In addition, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy of a Hedge Counterparty, if the Issuer fails to terminate the applicable Hedge Agreement in a timely manner, such Hedge Agreement could be assumed by the bankruptcy estate of such Hedge Counterparty and the Issuer could be required to continue making payments to such Hedge Counterparty, even if such Hedge Counterparty failed to perform its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement prior to the assumption. In either case, amounts available for payments to Noteholders would be reduced and may be materially reduced. See “Risk Factors – Relating to the Notes - Flip clauses” above.
3.15 Concentration risk

The Issuer will invest in a Portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations consisting, of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds. Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.
3.16 Credit risk

Risks applicable to Collateral Debt Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Debt Obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and assets of the type forming the Collateral and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.
3.17 Interest rate risk

It is possible that Collateral Debt Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations.
In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements as more particularly set out in “Hedging Arrangements”. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure.
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
3.18 Currency risk and Asset Swap Transactions

Although the Issuer intends to hedge against certain currency exposures pursuant to the Asset Swap Transactions, fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate for currencies in which Non-Euro Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Collateral being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders or may result in a decrease in value of the Collateral for the purposes of sale hereof upon enforcement of the security over it.
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under the Asset Swap Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.
Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events increase the risk of a mismatch between the Non-Euro Obligations and the Notes. This may cause losses. The Investment Manager may be limited at the time of reinvestment in its choice of Collateral Debt Obligations because of the cost of the foreign exchange hedging and due to restrictions in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement with respect to exercising such hedging. In addition, it may not be economically advantageous or feasible for the Issuer to exercise its hedging arrangements and such hedging arrangements may not be sufficient to protect the Issuer from fluctuations in Euro exchange rates.
The Issuer will depend upon each Asset Swap Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Asset Swap Agreement. If any Asset Swap Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Asset Swap Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.
3.19 The Issuer may not be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria

A portion of the initial Collateral Debt Obligations is expected to be purchased after the Issue Date as described herein. The ability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire an initial portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfies the Reinvestment Criteria at the projected prices, ratings, rates of interest and any other applicable characteristics will be subject to market conditions and availability of such Collateral Debt Obligations. Any inability of the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria specified herein may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Rated Notes and the distributions on the
Subordinated Notes. There is no assurance that the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) will be able to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations that satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria.
3.20 Rising interest rates may render some Obligors unable to pay interest on their Collateral Debt Obligations

Most of the Collateral Debt Obligations bear interest at floating interest rates. To the extent interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by the related Obligors will also increase. As prevailing interest rates increase, some Obligors may not be able to make the increased interest payments on Collateral Debt Obligations or refinance their balloon and bullet Collateral Debt Obligations, resulting in payment defaults and Defaulted Obligations. Conversely if interest rates decline, Obligors may refinance their Collateral Debt Obligations at lower interest rates which could shorten the average life of the Notes.
3.21 Balloon obligations and bullet obligations present refinancing risk

The Portfolio will include a large number of Collateral Debt Obligations that are either balloon obligations or bullet obligations. Balloon obligations and bullet obligations involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the Obligor to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation. The ability of such Obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Collateral Debt Obligation prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity. The ability of any Obligor to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such Obligor, the financial condition of such Obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Collateral Debt Obligation, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such Obligor may not have the ability to repay the Collateral Debt Obligation at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the principal of the Collateral Debt Obligation. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some Obligors may have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their balloon and bullet Collateral Debt Obligation on a timely basis or at all.
3.22 Regulatory risk

In many jurisdictions, especially in Continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions whether conducted via the granting of loans, purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Lending Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws. In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretative guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Lending Activities in such jurisdictions.
As such, Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to these local law requirements. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Debt Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Debt Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.
Collateral Debt Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Debt Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such
regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor. The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for Secured Senior Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.
4. Relating to certain conflicts of interest

In general, the transaction described in this Offering Circular will involve various potential and actual conflicts of interest.
Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activity of the Investment Manager, its clients and its Affiliates, the Rating Agencies, the Arranger and its Affiliates and the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
4.1 Investment Manager

Past performance of Investment Manager not indicative

The past performance of the Investment Manager and principals or Affiliates thereof in managing other portfolios or investment vehicles may not be indicative of the results that the Investment Manager may be able to achieve with the Collateral Debt Obligations. Similarly, the past performance of the Investment Manager and principals or Affiliates thereof over a particular period may not be indicative of the results that may occur in future periods. Furthermore, the nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer’s investments may differ from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Investment Manager and principals and Affiliates thereof. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as past investments of the Investment Manager or principals or Affiliates thereof, that the Issuer will be able to avoid losses or that the Issuer will be able to make investments similar to such past investment. In addition, such past investments may have been made utilising a leveraged capital structure and an asset mix and fee arrangements that are different from the anticipated capital structure, asset mix and fee arrangements of the Issuer. Moreover, because the eligibility criteria that govern investments in the Collateral Debt Obligations do not govern the principals’ investments and investment strategies generally, such investments conducted in accordance with such criteria, and the results they yield, are not directly comparable with, and may differ substantially from, other investments undertaken by the Investment Manager and principals and Affiliates thereof.
The Issuer will depend on the managerial expertise available to the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and its key personnel

The Issuer’s investment activities as regards the management of the Portfolio will generally be directed by the Investment Manager. The Noteholders will generally not make decisions with respect to the management, disposition or other realisation of any Collateral Debt Obligation, or other decisions regarding the business and affairs of the Issuer. Consequently, the performance of the Portfolio of the Issuer will depend, in large part, on the financial and managerial expertise of the Investment Manager’s investment professionals from time to time. There can be no assurance that such investment professionals will continue to serve in their current positions or continue to be employed by the Investment Manager. If one or more of the investment professionals of the Investment Manager were to leave the Investment Manager, the Investment Manager would have to reassign responsibilities internally and/or hire one or more replacement employees, and the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer. See “The Investment Manager” and “Description of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement”.
The Issuer will be subject to various conflicts of interest involving the Investment Manager and its Affiliates

The following briefly summarises certain potential and actual conflicts of interest which may arise from the overall investment activity of the Investment Manager, its clients and its Affiliates, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
The Investment Manager will (in its capacity as Retention Holder) on the Issue Date subscribe for, hold and retain, from the Issue Date, on an ongoing basis, not less than 5 per cent. of the nominal value of each Class of Notes on the Issue Date provided that (i) if Alcentra Limited is removed as Investment Manager and none of its Affiliates are appointed as successor Investment Manager, then it (or any of its Affiliates to which the Retention Notes have been transferred in accordance with paragraph (ii) below), may dispose of the Retention Notes provided that such transfer is permitted in accordance with the Retention Requirements and provided that such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements; and (ii) the Investment Manager may at any time transfer the Retention Notes to an Affiliate which is part of the same consolidated accounting group as the Investment Manager provided that such transfer is permitted in accordance with the Retention Requirements and provided that such transfer would not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements provided further that if at any time following (and as a consequence of) such transfer it is necessary to ensure compliance with the Retention Requirements, the Investment Manager shall procure that the Retention Notes are re-transferred to itself or any other entity permitted under the Retention Requirements at such time. The Investment Manager and its employees, clients and Affiliates may buy additional Notes at any time, from which the Investment Manager or such employees, clients or Affiliates may derive revenues and profits in addition to the fees disclosed herein. There will be no restriction on the ability of the Investment Manager or any Affiliate of the Investment Manager, any director, officer or employee of such entities or any fund or account for which the Investment Manager or its Affiliates exercises discretionary voting authority on behalf of such fund or account in respect of the Notes (an “Investment Manager Related Person”), the Retention Holder, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, or any of their respective Affiliates or employees to purchase the Notes (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) and to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled (except that Notes held by the Investment Manager and any Investment Manager Related Person shall be disregarded with respect to voting rights in connection with the removal of the Investment Manager and as otherwise described in the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement).
If an Optional Redemption, redemption following a Note Tax Event or an acceleration of the Notes after an Event of Default occurs, the Investment Manager has the right to bid on all or a portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations for its own account, the account of any Affiliate or an account that it manages, subject to the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in the Trust Deed.
The Investment Manager is entitled to the Senior Investment Management Fee, the Subordinated Investment Management Fee and in certain circumstances, the Junior Investment Management Fee in the priorities set forth herein, subject to the Priorities of Payment as described herein and the availability of funds therefor. By reason of the Junior Investment Management Fee, the Investment Manager may have a conflict between its obligation to manage the Portfolio prudently and the financial incentive created by such fees for the Investment Manager to make investments that are riskier or more aggressive than would be the case in the absence of such fees.
Although the Investment Manager and certain of its officers and employees will devote such time and effort as may be reasonably required to enable the Investment Manager to discharge its duties to the Issuer under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, they will not devote all of their working time to the affairs of the Issuer. As part of their regular business, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions both for their respective accounts and for the accounts of their respective clients, on a principal or agency basis, with respect to loans, securities and other investments and financial instruments of all types. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees also provide investment advisory services, among other services. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees will not be restricted in their performance of any such services or in the types of debt or equity investments which they may make. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may have economic interests in or other relationships with issuers in whose obligations or securities or credit exposures the Issuer may invest. In particular, such persons may make and/or hold an investment in an issuer’s securities that may be pari passu, senior or junior in ranking to an investment in such issuer’s securities made and/or held by the Issuer or in which partners, security holders, officers, directors, agents or employees of such persons serve on boards of directors or otherwise have ongoing relationships. Each of such ownership and other relationships may result in securities laws restrictions on transactions in such securities by the Issuer and otherwise create conflicts of interest for the Issuer. In such instances, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may in their discretion make investment
recommendations and effect investment decisions that may be the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer’s investments. In connection with any such activities described above, the Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees may hold, purchase, sell, trade or take other related actions in securities or investments of a type that may be suitable to be included as Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and their respective officers and employees will not be required to offer such securities or investments to the Issuer or provide notice of such activities to the Issuer.
The Investment Manager, its clients, its partners, its members or their employees and their Affiliates (“Related Entities”) have invested and may continue to invest in debt obligations that would also be appropriate as Collateral Debt Obligations and may purchase or sell securities and loans for or on behalf of themselves and their managed accounts without purchasing or selling such securities or loans for the Issuer and may purchase or sell securities or loans for the Issuer without purchasing or selling such securities or loans for themselves or their managed accounts, subject to any restrictions applicable in the Investment Advisers Act. Neither the Investment Manager nor any Related Entity has any duty, in making or maintaining such investments, to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any such opportunity to the Issuer. The investment policies, fee arrangements and other circumstances applicable to such other parties may vary from those applicable to the Issuer. The Investment Manager and its Related Entities may also have or establish relationships with companies whose debt obligations are Collateral Debt Obligations and may now or in the future own or seek to acquire equity securities or debt obligations issued by issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations, and such debt obligations may have interests different from or adverse to the debt obligations that are Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may in the future organise and manage one or more entities with objectives similar to or different from those of the Issuer. In addition, the Investment Manager and any of its Related Entities may serve as a general partner and/or manager of limited partnerships or other entities organised to issue notes or certificates, similar to the Notes, which are secured by high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments, or may manage third party accounts which invest in high-yield debt securities, loans and other investments. The Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may also provide other advisory services for a fee to issuers whose debt obligations or other securities are Collateral Debt Obligations, and neither the Noteholders nor the Issuer shall have any right to such fees. In connection with the foregoing activities the Investment Manager and/or any Related Entity may from time to time come into possession of material non-public information that limits the ability of the Investment Manager to effect a transaction for the Issuer, and the Issuer’s investments may be constrained as a consequence of the Investment Manager’s inability to use such information for advisory purposes or otherwise to effect transactions that otherwise may have been initiated on behalf of its clients, including the Issuer. See “The Investment Manager”.
Furthermore, the Investment Manager’s ability to buy obligations (on behalf of the Issuer) for inclusion in the Portfolio or sell obligations which are part of the Portfolio may be restricted by limitations contained in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) may be unable to buy or sell obligations or to take other actions that the Investment Manager might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders. The Investment Manager and any of its Affiliates may engage in any other business and furnish investment management and advisory services to others, which may include, without limitation, serving as investment manager for, investing in, lending to, or being Affiliated with, other entities organised to issue collateralised bond or debt obligations secured by securities such as the Notes and other trusts and pooled investment vehicles that acquire interests in, provide financing to, or otherwise deal with securities issued by, issuers that would be suitable investments for the Issuer. The Investment Manager will be free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or for others, that may be the same as or different from those effected on behalf of the Issuer, and the Investment Manager may furnish investment management and advisory services to others who may have investment policies similar to those followed by the Investment Manager with respect to the Issuer and who may own securities which are the same type as the Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Investment Manager may, to the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, effect client cross- transactions where the Investment Manager causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and other account(s) advised by it or any of its Affiliates. In addition, with the prior authorisation of the Issuer, which can be revoked at any time, the Investment Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under
applicable law and subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, in which case any such Affiliate will receive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both parties to the transaction. In addition, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, effect transactions between the Issuer and the Investment Manager and/or any of its Affiliates as principal.
The Investment Manager may make recommendations and effect transactions on behalf of its Related Entities which differ from those effected with respect to the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager may often be seeking simultaneously to purchase or sell investments for the Issuer, itself and similar entities or other investment accounts for which it serves as Investment Manager or for Related Entities, and the Investment Manager will have the discretion to apportion such purchases or sales among such entities. Prior to the Issue Date, the Investment Manager may effect acquisitions of Collateral Debt Obligations or enter into binding commitments to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations on behalf of the Issuer, from funds or other CLOs in relation to which Alcentra Limited, or any of its Affiliates, may be the investment manager or may exercise investment discretion in relation thereto. The Investment Manager cannot assure equal treatment across its investment clients. When the Investment Manager determines that it would be appropriate for the Issuer and one or more Related Entities to participate in an investment opportunity or sell an investment, the Investment Manager will seek to execute orders for all of the participating investment accounts, including the Issuer and its own account, on an equitable basis. If the Investment Manager has determined to invest or sell at the same time for more than one of the Related Entities, the Investment Manager will generally place combined orders for all such Related Entities simultaneously and if all such orders are not filled at the same price, it will use reasonable efforts to allocate such purchases and sales in an equitable manner and in accordance with applicable law. Similarly, if an order on behalf of more than one Related Entity cannot be fully executed under prevailing market conditions, the Investment Manager will allocate the investments traded among the Issuer and different Related Entities on a basis that it considers equitable. Situations may occur where the Issuer could be disadvantaged because of the investment activities conducted by the Investment Manager for the Related Entities.
The Investment Manager may participate in creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or work out of issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations. In such circumstances, the Investment Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager will be entitled to receive any steering committee fees (except any fees received in connection with the extension of the maturity of a Defaulted Obligation or a reduction in the outstanding principal balance of a Defaulted Obligation) received in connection with the work out or restructuring of any Defaulted Obligations or Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Trust Deed places significant restrictions on the Investment Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Debt Obligations, and the Investment Manager is required to comply with these restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Investment Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Debt Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interests of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Trust Deed.
With respect to any vote in connection with the removal of Alcentra Limited as the Investment Manager, any Notes held by the Investment Manager, an Affiliate thereof or any funds or accounts managed by the Investment Manager or one of its Affiliates as to which the Investment Manager or one of its Affiliates has discretionary voting authority shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding in connection with such vote. Any investment in Notes by Alcentra Limited or one or more Affiliates of Alcentra Limited or accounts managed by Alcentra Limited as to which Alcentra Limited has discretionary voting authority may give the Investment Manager an incentive to take actions that may vary from the interests of the holders of other Notes.
The Investment Manager may discuss the composition of the Issuer’s Collateral Debt Obligations or other matters relating to the transaction with its Affiliates or clients purchasing Notes or with third party investors. There can be no assurance that any such discussions will not influence the Investment Manager’s decisions. Furthermore, so long as the Issuer is relying on the exemption from the Investment Company Act provided by Rule 3a-7, it is not permitted to acquire or dispose of Collateral Debt Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities or Eligible Investments for the primary purpose of recognising gains or decreasing losses from market value changes. This could prevent
the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) from selling assets that the Investment Manager expects may decline in value or from reinvesting principal payments or sale proceeds in Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Issuer has the right by notice to the Trustee to elect to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act and to no longer rely on the exemption from the Investment Company Act provided by Rule 3a-7. The Investment Manager, in its capacity as agent to the Issuer, has the discretion to advise the Issuer to make such election and accordingly the Issuer may cease to rely upon the exemption provided by Rule 3a-7 in the future. The Investment Manager, in making any such a recommendation, and the Issuer in electing to elect to cease to rely upon Rule 3a-7, do not have a duty to act in a way that is favourable to individual or classes of Noteholders and conflicts of interests may arise accordingly. See further “Risk Factors - The Volcker Rule”.
As further described in “Risk Factor - The Issuer may acquire certain Collateral Debt Obligations prior to the Issue Date”, prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer may acquire, or enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Debt Obligations from funds or other CLOs in relation to which Alcentra Limited, or any of its Affiliates, may be the investment manager or may exercise investment discretion in relation thereto. If any such acquisitions or commitments were to take place, the relevant transactions would be executed at a mid-market price obtained from, to the extent possible, an external pricing service selected by the Investment Manager in accordance with its internal pricing procedures. Where such external pricing service is not readily available or is not considered reliable, alternative quotations will be sought (although, ultimately if there are no available or reliable external quotations, a determination will be made internally of a reasonable fair value, which must be approved by the pricing committee of the Investment Manager), all in accordance with the Investment Manager’s internal pricing policy procedures.
4.2 The Issuer will be subject to certain conflicts of interest between the Collateral Administrator, the Principal Paying Agent, the Account Bank, the Custodian, the Information Agent, the Liquidity Facility Provider and the Investment Manager due to common ownership

The Collateral Administrator for the Issuer’s assets, the Principal Paying Agent, the Account Bank, the Custodian, the Information Agent and the Liquidity Facility Provider are Affiliates of the Investment Manager. While the parties are, of course, required to fulfil their contractual obligations under the Transaction Documents to which they are a party, conflicts of interest may nevertheless arise as a result of The Bank of New York Mellon and its Affiliates acting as Investment Manager, as Collateral Administrator, as Principal Paying Agent, as Account Bank, as Custodian, as Information Agent and as Liquidity Facility Provider, as appropriate. For example, conflicts of interest may arise between the performance of the Collateral Administrator’s duties and determinations and the interests of the Investment Manager.
4.3 The Issuer will be subject to certain conflicts of interest involving the Rating Agencies

S&P and Moody’s have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where, as is the case with the ratings of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings), the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services.
4.4 The Issuer will be subject to various conflicts of interest involving or relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates

Merrill Lynch International and its Affiliates (the “Merrill Lynch Parties”) will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction, as lender and senior agent in respect of any Warehouse Facility and in other roles described below.
The Merrill Lynch Parties may formulate and develop the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests, the Priorities of Payment and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. These may be influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have or have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Notes or any particular Class of Notes.
Merrill Lynch International will purchase the Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Notes. Merrill Lynch International may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Notes and hedging transactions). Merrill Lynch International expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Merrill Lynch Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The Merrill Lynch Parties may have positions in and will likely have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations (or other obligations of the obligors of Collateral Debt Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to obligors of certain Collateral Debt Obligations. As a result, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may possess information relating to obligors on or issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations that is not known to the Investment Manager. None of the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Investment Manager or the Issuer. As a result, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may compete with the Issuer for appropriate investment opportunities and will be under no duty or obligation to share such investment opportunities with the Issuer. The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer. In addition, the Merrill Lynch Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Debt Obligations. Each of the Merrill Lynch Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the holders of the Notes or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of obligors affiliated with the Merrill Lynch Parties or in which one or more Merrill Lynch Parties hold an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Debt Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Merrill Lynch Party’s own investments in such obligors.
From time to time the Investment Manager will purchase from or sell Collateral Debt Obligations through or to the Merrill Lynch Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Debt Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and that one or more Merrill Lynch Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to participation interests and/or a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement or spot foreign exchange transaction. The Merrill Lynch Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or collateral manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Notes.
The Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations when such Collateral Debt Obligations were originally issued and may have provided or be providing investment banking services and other services to issuers of certain Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager may purchase or sell Collateral Debt Obligations through, from or to the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates, subject to such procedures and restrictions as are appropriate to comply with applicable law with respect to transactions in which an Affiliate of the Investment Manager is acting as principal.
The Merrill Lynch Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Merrill Lynch Parties and employees or customers of the Merrill Lynch Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions similar to referencing the Notes, Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments or the obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. In addition, the Merrill Lynch Parties may purchase Collateral Debt Obligations (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) for re-packaging purposes or enter into transactions related or linked to the Collateral Debt Obligations, including purchasing credit protection on them or the underlying assets. If a Merrill Lynch Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Merrill Lynch Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it
would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Notes. The price at which a Merrill Lynch Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes. See also “Plan of Distribution” and “Use of Proceeds”.

In the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of Notes represented by one Definitive Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a further

If the Issuer determines at any time that a U.S. Holder of Rule 144A Notes is not a QIB/QP (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Holder”), the Issuer may direct such holder to sell or transfer its Notes outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or within the United States to a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP within thirty calendar days following receipt of such notice. If such holder fails to sell or transfer its Rule 144A Notes within such period, such holder may be required by the
Issuer to sell such Rule 144A Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer on such terms as the Issuer may choose, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Rule 144A Notes and selling such Rule 144A Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the permitted Noteholder to the Non-Permitted Holder by its acceptance of an interest in the Rule 144A Notes agrees to co-operate with the Issuer to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and the Issuer shall not be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to submit a written certification substantiating that it is a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. If such holder fails to submit any such requested written certification on a timely basis, the Issuer has the right to assume that the holder of the Notes from whom such a certification is requested is not a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. Furthermore, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse to honour a transfer of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Note to any Person who is not either a non-U.S. Person or a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP.
(i) Forced sale pursuant to FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may enter into an agreement with the IRS pursuant to which it will be required to, among other things, provide certain information about the Noteholders to a tax authority (or comply with similar requirements under an IGA). The Issuer intends to enter into such an agreement and the Issuer expects to require each Noteholder to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and certain of its owners. The Issuer may force the sale of a Noteholder’s Notes in order to comply with FATCA, including Notes held by a Noteholder that fails to provide the required information or if the Issuer otherwise reasonably determines that a Noteholder’s acquisition or holding of an interest in such a Note would cause the Issuer to be unable to comply with FATCA (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value). For these purposes, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a Noteholder’s interest in its Notes in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA. If the Issuer is required to force such sale, the Issuer shall require the Holder to sell its Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer on such terms as the Issuer may choose, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities and selling such Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the Noteholder to the Recalcitrant Noteholder by its acceptance of an interest in the Notes agrees to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Registrar shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to provide any information required under FATCA.
(j) Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA

If any Noteholder is determined by the Issuer to be a Noteholder who has made or is deemed to have made a prohibited transaction, Benefit Plan Investor, Other Plan Law or Similar Law representation that is subsequently shown to be false or misleading, or whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. limitation set out in Title I of ERISA and section 4975 of the Code (any such Noteholder a “Non-Permitted ERISA Holder”), the Non-Permitted
ERISA Holder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer, to the extent required to effect such transfers. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer. The Non-Permitted ERISA Holder will receive the balance, if any.
(k) Forced Transfer Mechanics and Registrar Authorisation

In order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced sale pursuant to FATCA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA), the Issuer may repay any affected Notes at par value and issue replacement Notes and the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents and the Registrar (each at the expense of the Issuer) shall work with the Clearing Systems to take such action as may be necessary to effect such repayment and issue of replacement Notes. The Noteholders hereby authorise the Registrar and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder. The Noteholders shall be bound by any actions taken by the Registrar, the Clearing Systems or any other party taken pursuant to the above-named Conditions.
(l) Contributions

At any time during or after the Reinvestment Period, any Noteholder may make a contribution of cash (a “Contribution” and each such Noteholder, a “Contributor”). The Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may accept or reject any Contribution in its reasonable discretion and will notify the Collateral Administrator of any such acceptance. If a Contribution is accepted, it will be received into the Contribution Account and applied towards a Permitted Use by the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer as directed by the Contributor at the time such Contribution is made (or, if no direction is given by the Contributor, at the Investment Manager’s reasonable discretion) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(xii) (Contribution Account). No Contribution or portion thereof will be returned to the Contributor at any time. The acceptance of Contributions shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) Contributions from Contributors may be made on a maximum of three Business Days and on each occasion shall be a minimum of EUR1,000,000 in aggregate; and
(ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will be satisfied immediately after a Contribution has been received.

Payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes will be subordinated in right of payment to payment of interest in respect of the Rated Notes. Interest on the Subordinated Notes shall be paid pari passu and without any preference amongst themselves.
No amount of principal in respect of the Class B Notes shall become due and payable until redemption and payment in full of the Class A Notes. No amount of principal in respect of the Class C Notes shall become due and payable until redemption and payment in full of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes.

Subject to the applicability of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, the Subordinated Notes will be entitled to receive, out of Principal Proceeds, the amounts described under the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Payments on the Subordinated Notes are subordinated to payments on the Rated Notes and other amounts described in the Priorities of Payment and no payments out of Principal Proceeds will be made on the Subordinated Notes until the Rated Notes and other payments ranking prior to the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are paid in full.

excluding for the purpose of (i) to (xiv) above:
(A) any and all assets, property or rights which are located in, or governed by the laws of, The Netherlands (except for contractual rights or receivables (rechten of


vorderingen op naam) which are assigned or charged to the Trustee pursuant to
(i) to (xiv) above);
(B) any and all assets, property or rights which are pledged pursuant to the Euroclear Security Agreement;
(C) any and all Dutch Ineligible Securities;
(D) the Issuer’s rights under the Issuer Management Agreement; and
(E) any and all amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Dutch Account.
The security created pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (xiv) above is granted to the Trustee for itself and as trustee for the Secured Parties as continuing security for the payment of the Secured Obligations provided that the security granted by the Issuer over any collateral provided to the Issuer pursuant to a Hedge Agreement or any amounts deposited in the Prefunded Commitment Account will only be available to the Secured Parties (other than with respect to the collateral provided to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to such Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account) and other than with respect to amounts deposited in the Prefunded Commitment Account which are repayable to the Liquidity Facility Provider pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement) when such collateral or amounts, as applicable, are expressed to be available to the Issuer and (if a title transfer arrangement) to the extent that no equivalent amount is owed to the Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the relevant Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(j)(v) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account). The security will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Issuer in respect of the above, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
If, for any reason, the purported assignment by way of security of, and/or the grant of first fixed charge over, the property, assets, rights and/or benefits described above is found to be ineffective in respect of any such property, assets, rights and/or benefits (together, the “Affected Collateral”), the Issuer shall hold to the fullest extent permitted under Dutch mandatory law the benefit of the Affected Collateral and any sums received in respect thereof or any security interest, guarantee or indemnity or undertaking of whatever nature given to secure such Affected Collateral (together, the “Trust Collateral”) on trust for the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall:
(i) account to the Trustee for or otherwise apply all sums received in respect of such Trust Collateral as the Trustee may direct (provided that, subject to these Conditions and the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall be entitled to apply the benefit of such Trust Collateral and such sums in respect of such Trust Collateral received by it and held on trust under this paragraph without prior direction from the Trustee);
(ii) exercise any rights it may have in respect of the Trust Collateral at the direction of the Trustee; and
(iii) at its own cost take such action and execute such documents as the Trustee may in its sole discretion require.
The Issuer may from time to time grant security:
(i) by way of a first priority security interest to a Hedge Counterparty over the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral deposited by such Hedge Counterparty in the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account related to such Hedge Counterparty as security for the Issuer’s obligations to repay or redeem such Counterparty Downgrade Collateral pursuant
to the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement and these Conditions (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between such third party, the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and the Trustee). For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may grant such security interest directly to the Hedge Counterparty; and/or
(ii) by way of a first fixed charge in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of firstly (to the extent amounts deposited in the Prefunded Commitment Account are repayable to the Liquidity Facility Provider) the Liquidity Facility Provider and thereafter to other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payment over all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of the Prefunded Commitment Account and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account and the debts represented thereby and including, without limitation, all interest accrued and other moneys received in respect thereof (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between the Liquidity Facility Provider, the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Trustee); and/or
(iii) by way of first priority security interest over amounts representing all or part of the Unfunded Amount of any Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation and deposited in its name with a third party as security for any payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation including but not limited to reimbursement or indemnification obligation of the Issuer owed to any other lender under such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation, subject to the terms of Condition 3(j)(vii) (The Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account) (including Rating Agency Confirmation),
excluding for the purposes of (i) to (iii) (inclusive) above: (a) any and all assets, property or rights which are located in, or governed by the laws of, The Netherlands; and (b) any and all Dutch Ineligible Securities.
All deeds, documents, assignments, instruments, bonds, notes, negotiable instruments, papers and any other instruments comprising, evidencing, representing and/or transferring the Portfolio will be deposited with or held by or on behalf of the Custodian until the security over such obligations is irrevocably discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed. If the ratings of the Custodian are downgraded to below the Rating Requirement or withdrawn, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that a replacement Custodian with the Rating Requirement and who is appointed in accordance with and on substantially the same terms as the Agency Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed, the Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction in value of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure the Collateral and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held in a clearing system or in safe custody by the Custodian, a bank or other custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for ensuring that the Custodian satisfies the Rating Requirement applicable to it or, if it fails to satisfy such Rating Requirement, to procure the appointment of a replacement custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for the management of the Portfolio by the Investment Manager or to supervise the administration of the Portfolio by the Collateral Administrator or by any other party and is entitled to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without further enquiry. The Trust Deed also provides that the Trustee shall accept without investigation, requisition or objection such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
Pursuant to the Euroclear Security Agreement, the Issuer has also created in favour of the Trustee (as Secured Party and as agent and representative of certain other Secured Parties), a Belgian law pledge over the Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer in Euroclear. Each Noteholder from time to time (including, but not limited to, the
Initial Purchaser) appoints the Trustee as its agent and representative under and in connection with the Notes, the Transaction Documents and the security created or expressed to be created under the Transaction Documents.
(b) Application of Proceeds upon Enforcement

The Trust Deed provides that the net proceeds of realisation of, or enforcement with respect to the security over, the Collateral constituted by the Trust Deed, shall be applied in accordance with the priorities of payment set out in Condition 11 (Enforcement).
(c) Limited Recourse

The obligations of the Issuer to pay amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties at any time shall be limited to the proceeds available at such time to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Conditions or any Transaction Documents, if the net proceeds of realisation of the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Euroclear Security Agreement, upon enforcement thereof in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the provisions of the Trust Deed are less than the aggregate amount payable in such circumstances by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties (such negative amount being referred to herein as a “shortfall”), the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of each Class and its obligations to the other Secured Parties in such circumstances will be limited to such net proceeds, which shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In such circumstances, the other assets (including the Issuer Dutch Account and its rights under the Issuer Management Agreement) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall which shall be borne by the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders and the Class F Noteholders, the Subordinated Noteholders and the other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (applied in reverse order). The rights of the Secured Parties (including the Noteholders) to receive any further amounts in respect of such obligations shall be extinguished and none of the Noteholders of each Class or the other Secured Parties may take any further action to recover such amounts. None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee or the other Secured Parties (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed and the Euroclear Security Agreement (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
In addition, none of the Noteholders or any of the other Secured Parties shall have any recourse against any director, shareholder or officer of the Issuer in respect of any obligations, covenants or agreement entered into or made by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Conditions of the Notes or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party or any notice or documents which it is requested to deliver hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Trustee, the Managing Directors, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager and any Agent has any obligation to any Noteholder of any Class for payment of any amount by the Issuer in respect of the Notes of any Class.
(d) Acquisition and Sale of Portfolio

The Investment Manager is required to manage the Portfolio and to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the
parameters set out in, the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and subject to the overall supervision and control of the Issuer. The duties of the Investment Manager with respect to the Portfolio include (amongst others) the use of reasonable endeavours to:
(i) purchase Collateral Debt Obligations on or prior to the Issue Date and during the Initial Investment Period;
(ii) invest the amounts standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account, the relevant Hedge Termination Account, the relevant Asset Swap Account and the Payment Account) in Eligible Investments;
(iii) sell certain of the Collateral Debt Obligations and reinvest the Principal Proceeds received in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the criteria set out in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement; and
(iv) unless the Issuer has determined that it shall no longer rely on Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act, cause the Issuer to be engaged in (A) purchasing, holding and selling “eligible assets” as defined in Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act and (B) activities related to or incidental to investment in such eligible assets.
The Investment Manager is required to monitor the Collateral Debt Obligations with a view to seeking to determine whether any Collateral Debt Obligation has converted into, or been exchanged for, an Exchanged Equity Security or Defaulted Obligation, provided that, if it fails to do so, it will not have any liability to the Issuer except by reason of acts constituting fraud, wilful misconduct or negligence in the performance of its obligations. No Noteholder shall have any recourse against any of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Arranger, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Trustee for any loss suffered as a result of such failure.
Under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Retention Holder, the holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Controlling Class have certain rights in respect of the removal of the Investment Manager and appointment of a replacement Investment Manager.
(e) Exercise of Rights in Respect of the Portfolio

Pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Issuer authorises the Investment Manager, prior to enforcement of the security over the Collateral, to exercise all rights and remedies of the Issuer in its capacity as a holder of, or person beneficially entitled to, the Portfolio. In particular, the Investment Manager is authorised, subject to any specific direction given by the Issuer, to attend and vote at any meeting of holders of, or other persons interested or participating in, or entitled to the rights or benefits (or a part thereof) under, the Portfolio and to give any consent, waiver, indulgence, time or notification, make any declaration or agree any composition, compounding or other similar arrangement with respect to any obligations forming part of the Portfolio.
(f) Information Regarding the Collateral

The Issuer shall procure that a copy of each Monthly Report and any Payment Date Report is made available upon publication, to each Noteholder of each Class, to the Trustee, the Investment Manager and each Rating Agency via the Collateral Administrator’s website currently located at https://gctinvestorreporting.bnymellon.com/Home.jsp. It is not intended that such Reports will be made available in any other format, save in limited circumstances with the Collateral Administrator’s agreement. The Collateral Administrator’s website does not form part of the
information provided for the purposes of the Offering Circular and disclaimers may be posted with respect to the information posted thereon. Registration may be required for access to such website and persons wishing to access such website may be required to certify that they are Noteholders or otherwise entitled to access such website.

6 Interest

(a) Payment Dates

(i) Rated Notes

The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes each bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable:
(A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling on or about 15 October 2014;
(B) during a Frequency Switch Period (except, in certain circumstances, in respect of the first Payment Date following the Frequency Switch Period), semi-annually; and
(C) at all other times, quarterly,
in each case, in arrear on each Payment Date.

Interest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes to the extent funds are available in accordance with paragraph (CC) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph
(S) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (AA) of the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments on each Payment Date and shall continue to be payable in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) notwithstanding redemption in full of any Subordinated Note at its applicable Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the Trust Deed, all references herein and therein to the Subordinated Notes being redeemed in full or at their Principal Amount Outstanding shall be deemed to be amended to the extent required to ensure that a minimum of €1 principal amount of each such Class of Notes remains Outstanding at all times and any amounts which are to be applied in redemption of each such Class of Notes pursuant hereto which are in excess of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof minus
€1, shall constitute interest payable in respect of such Notes and shall not be applied in redemption of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof, provided always however that such €1 principal shall no longer remain Outstanding and each such Class of Notes shall be redeemed in full on the date on which all of the Collateral securing the Notes has been realised and is to be finally distributed to the Noteholders.
If the aggregate of income and gains earned by the Issuer during an accounting period exceeds the costs and expenses accrued for that period, such excess shall accrue as additional interest on the Subordinated Notes but shall only be payable on any Payment Date following payment in full of amounts payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payment on such Payment Date.
(b) Interest Accrual

(i) Floating Rate Notes

Each Floating Rate Note (or, as the case may be, the relevant part thereof due to be redeemed) will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, it shall continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of:
(A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder; and
(B) the day following seven calendar days after the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent has notified the Noteholders of such Class of Notes in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes of such Class up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
(ii) Subordinated Notes

Payments on the Subordinated Notes will cease to be payable in respect of each Subordinated Note upon the date that all of the Collateral has been realised and no Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral remain available for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(c) Deferral of Interest

(i) Deferred Interest

For so long as any of the Class A Notes remain Outstanding, the Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes in full on any Payment Date, in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, for so long as any of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes remain Outstanding, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount which would, but for the first paragraph of this Condition 6(c)(i) (Deferred Interest) otherwise be due and payable in respect of such Class of Notes on any Payment Date (each such amount being referred to as “Deferred Interest”) will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class of Notes, and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will not be an Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Notes are to be repaid or redeemed in full, provided always however that if the relevant Class is the then Controlling Class, Deferred Interest shall not be added to the principal amount of such Class and failure to pay any Interest Amount due and payable on such Class within five Business Days (or seven Business Days due to an administrative error or omission in accordance with Condition 10 (Events of Default)) of the Payment Date in full will constitute an Event of Default. Interest will cease to accrue on each Note, or in the case of a partial repayment, on such part, from the date of repayment or the Maturity Date or early redemption date unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or unless default is otherwise made with respect to such payment of principal.
(ii) Non-payment of Interest

Following redemption in full of the Class A Notes, non-payment of interest on the Class B Notes, following redemption in full of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, non- payment of interest on the Class C Notes, following redemption in full of the Class C Notes, non-payment of interest on the Class D Notes, following redemption in full of the Class D Notes, non-payment of interest on the Class E Notes following redemption in full of the Class E Notes, non-payment of interest on the Class F Notes, shall constitute an Event of Default following expiry of the five Business Days grace period.
(d) Payment of Deferred Interest

Deferred Interest in respect of any Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note shall only become payable by the Issuer in accordance with respectively, paragraphs (L), (O), (R) and
(U) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraphs (D), (G), (J) and (M) of the Principal
Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraphs (L), (O), (R) and (U) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and under the Note Payment Sequence in each place specified in the Priorities of Payment, to the extent that Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, as applicable, are available to make such payment in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (and, if applicable, the Note Payment Sequence). For the avoidance of doubt, for so long as any Class A Notes and/or Class B Notes remain Outstanding, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes, as applicable will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or Class F Notes as applicable. An amount equal to any such Deferred Interest so paid shall be subtracted from the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes as applicable.
(e) Interest on the Floating Rate Notes

(i) Floating Rate of Interest

The rate of interest from time to time in respect of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class B Notes (the “Class B Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class C Notes (the “Class C Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class D Notes (the “Class D Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class E Notes (the “Class E Floating Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class F Notes (the “Class F Floating Rate of Interest”) (and each a “Floating Rate of Interest”) will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:
(A) On each Interest Determination Date:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, the Calculation Agent will determine a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for six and nine month Euro deposits;
(2) during a Frequency Switch Period (or on the Interest Determination Date immediately prior to a Frequency Switch Period if a Frequency Switch Period will commence during the following Accrual Period or, if at the time of the Interest Determination Date immediately prior to a Frequency Switch Period it was not known that a Frequency Switch Period would commence during the following Accrual Period, commencing from the Interest Determination Date immediately after the Frequency Switch Period begins), the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for six months Euro deposits; and
(3) at all other times, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for three months Euro deposits,
the applicable offered rate, the “Designated Maturity” and in each case, as at
11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. Such offered rate will be that which appears on the display designated on the Bloomberg Screen "BTMM EU" Page (or such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying EURIBOR rates). The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (as defined below) and the rate which so appears, all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(B) If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then paragraph (A) shall be applied, with any necessary
consequential changes, to the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not so appear, or if the relevant page is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of four major banks in the Euro zone interbank market acting in each case through its principal Euro zone office (the “Reference Banks”) to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market for the applicable Designated Maturity as at 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period, shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (if any) and the arithmetic mean, in each case, (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of such quotations (or of such of them, being at least two, as are so provided), all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(C) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides such quotation, the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, respectively, for the next Accrual Period shall be the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest, in each case in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period.
(D) Where:
“Applicable Margin” means:
(1) in the case of the Class A Notes: 1.40 per cent. per annum;
(2) in the case of the Class B Notes: 2.00 per cent. per annum;
(3) in the case of the Class C Notes: 2.65 per cent. per annum;
(4) in the case of the Class D Notes: 3.35 per cent. per annum;
(5) in the case of the Class E Notes: 4.60 per cent. per annum; and
(6) in the case of the Class F Notes: 5.60 per cent. per annum.
(ii) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Interest Determination Date, but in no event later than the Business Day after such date, determine the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest and calculate the interest amount payable in respect of original principal amounts of the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and the Class F Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The
amount of interest (the “Interest Amount”) payable in respect of each Authorised Integral Amount applicable to any such Notes shall be calculated by applying the Class A Note Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class B Notes, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class D Notes, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest in the case of the Class E Notes and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest in the case of Class F Notes, respectively, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of such Authorised Integral Amount, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned, divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest €0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
Where paragraph (A)(3) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) applies, any test or calculation required to be made in accordance with the Trust Deed, the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or any other Transaction Document: (i) where such test or calculation requires a determination of a Floating Rate of Interest, and (ii) the date of such test or calculation falls in between two Interest Determination Dates, the applicable offered rate shall be the offered rate which was applicable as of the previous Interest Determination Date.
(iii) Reference Banks and Calculation Agent

The Issuer will procure that, so long as any Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note remains Outstanding:
(A) a Calculation Agent shall be appointed and maintained for the purposes of determining the interest rate and interest amount payable in respect of the Notes; and
(B) if the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest are to be calculated by Reference Banks pursuant to paragraph (B) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), that the number of Reference Banks required pursuant to such paragraph (B) are requested to provide a quotation.
If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the purpose of calculating interest hereunder or fails duly to establish any Floating Rate of Interest for any Accrual Period, or to calculate the Interest Amount on any Class of Rated Notes, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the Trustee) appoint some other leading bank to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor having been so appointed.
(f) Proceeds in respect of Subordinated Notes

Solely in respect of Subordinated Notes, the Collateral Administrator will on each Determination Date calculate the Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds payable to the extent of available funds in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds payable on each Payment Date in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds to be applied on the Subordinated Notes on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to paragraph (CC) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, paragraph (S) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments and paragraph (AA) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payment by fractions equal to the amount of
such Authorised Integral Amount, as applicable, divided by the aggregate original principal amount of the Subordinated Notes.
(g) Publication of Floating Rates of Interest, Interest Amounts and Deferred Interest

The Calculation Agent will cause the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest and the Class F Floating Rate of Interest or the Interest Amounts payable in respect of each Class of Rated Notes, the amount of any Deferred Interest due but not paid on any Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes for each Accrual Period and Payment Date and the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes as of the applicable Payment Date to be notified to the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee and the Investment Manager, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter, and the Principal Paying Agent shall cause each such rate, amount and date to be notified to the Noteholders of each Class in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible following notification to the Principal Paying Agent but in no event later than the third Business Day after such notification. The Interest Amounts in respect of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes or the Payment Date in respect of any Class of Notes so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made with the consent of the Trustee by way of adjustment) without notice if an extension or shortening of the Accrual Period occurs. If the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10 (Events of Default), interest shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) but no publication of the applicable Interest Amounts shall be made unless the Trustee so determines.
(h) Determination or Calculation by Trustee

If the Calculation Agent does not at any time for any reason so calculate the Class A Floating Rate of Interest, the Class B Floating Rate of Interest, the Class C Floating Rate of Interest, the Class D Floating Rate of Interest, the Class E Floating Rate of Interest or the Class F Floating Rate of Interest for an Accrual Period, the Trustee (or a person appointed by it for the purpose) shall do so and such determination or calculation shall be deemed to have been made by the Calculation Agent and shall be binding on the Noteholders. In doing so, the Trustee, or such person appointed by it, shall apply the foregoing provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), with any necessary consequential amendments, to the extent that, in its opinion, it can do so, and in all other respects it shall do so in such manner as it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and reliance on such persons as it has appointed for such purpose. The Trustee shall have no liability to any person in connection with any determination or calculation (including with regard to the timelines thereof) it is required to make pursuant to this Condition 6(h) (Determination or Calculation by Trustee).
(i) Notifications, etc. to be Final

All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Calculation Agent or the Trustee, will (in the absence of manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and all Noteholders and (in the absence as referred to above) no liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders of any Class shall attach to the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent or the Trustee in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 6(i) (Notifications, etc. to be Final).
7 Redemption and Purchase

(a) Final Redemption

Save to the extent previously redeemed in full and cancelled, the Notes of each Class will be redeemed on the Maturity Date of such Notes. In the case of a redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption), the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes will be redeemed at their Redemption Price in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence and the Subordinated Notes will be redeemed at the amount equal to their share of the amounts of Principal Proceeds to be applied towards such redemption pursuant to paragraph (S) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Notes may not be redeemed other than in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

In the case of a Refinancing in relation to the redemption of all of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part pursuant to Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders or Retention Holder) as described above, such Refinancing will be effective only if:
(1) the Issuer provides prior written notice thereof to S&P and Moody’s;
(2) all Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds, if any, from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay any Refinancing Costs and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes save for the Subordinated Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments;

(5) the Refinancing Proceeds are used (to the extent necessary) to make such redemption;
(6) each agreement entered into by the Issuer in respect of such Refinancing contains limited recourse and non-petition provisions substantially the same as those contained in the Trust Deed;
(7) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Obligations for each Class is equal to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class or Classes of Notes being redeemed with the Refinancing Proceeds;

(10) payments in respect of the Refinancing Obligations are subject to the Priorities of Payment and rank at the same priority pursuant to the Priorities of Payment as the relevant Class or Classes of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(11) the voting rights, consent rights, redemption rights and all other rights of the Refinancing Obligations are the same as the rights of the corresponding Class of Rated Notes being redeemed;
(12) all Refinancing Proceeds are received by (or on behalf of) the Issuer prior to the applicable Redemption Date; and
(13) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, the Issuer will continue to be in compliance with the requirements for the registration exemption under Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act,
in each case, as certified to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Investment Manager.
If, in relation to a proposed optional redemption of the Notes (whether in whole or in part, as applicable), any of the relevant conditions specified in this Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the relevant redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Investment Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
None of the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee shall be liable to any party, including the Subordinated Noteholders, for any failure to obtain a Refinancing.
(E) Consequential Amendments

Following a Refinancing, the Trustee shall agree to the modification of the Trust Deed (including these Conditions) and the other Transaction Documents to the extent which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee is necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing. No further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of Notes.
The Trustee will not be obliged to enter into any modification that, in its sole opinion (acting reasonably), adversely affects its rights, powers, duties, obligations, liabilities, indemnities or protections under the Trust Deed, and the Trustee will be entitled to conclusively rely upon an officer’s certificate and/or opinion of counsel as to matters of law (which may be supported as to factual
(including financial and capital markets) matters by any relevant certificates and other documents necessary or advisable in the judgment of counsel delivering such opinion of counsel) provided by the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document to the effect that such amendment meets the requirements specified above and is permitted under the Trust Deed (including these Conditions) without the consent of the holders of the Notes (except that such officer or counsel will have no obligation to certify or opine as to the sufficiency of the Refinancing Proceeds).
(vi) Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes effected through Liquidation only

Following receipt of notice from the Issuer or, as the case may be, of confirmation from the Transfer Agent or Principal Paying Agent of:
(A) a direction in writing from the requisite percentage of Subordinated Noteholders (in the case of Condition 7(b)(i) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Subordinated Noteholders or Retention Holder) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event));
(B) a direction in writing from the requisite percentage of the Controlling Class (in the case of Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event));

(D) a direction in writing from the Investment Manager (in the case of a Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption in Whole – Investment Manager Clean-up Call)),
as the case may be, to exercise any right of optional redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Collateral, the Collateral Administrator shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than seventeen Business Days prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date (the “Redemption Determination Date”), provided that the Collateral Administrator has received such notice or confirmation at least twenty Business Days prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, calculate the Redemption Threshold Amount in consultation with the Investment Manager.
The Notes shall not be optionally redeemed where such Optional Redemption is to be effected solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Portfolio unless:
(A) At least five Business Days before the scheduled Redemption Date the Investment Manager shall have furnished to the Trustee evidence in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee that the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer has entered into a binding agreement or agreements with a financial or other institution or institutions which:
(1) either:
(a) has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least “A” by S&P and, if it has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least “A” by S&P, a short-term issuer credit rating of at least “A-1” by S&P
or, if it does not have an S&P long-term issuer credit rating, a short-term issuer credit rating of at least “A-1” by S&P; or
(b) in respect of which a Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P has been obtained; and
(2) either:
(a) has a long-term issuer credit rating of at least “A1” by Moody’s;

(c) in respect of which Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s has been obtained,
to purchase (directly or by participation or other arrangement) from the Issuer, not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Redemption Date in immediately available funds, all or part of the Portfolio at a purchase price at least sufficient, together with the Eligible Investments maturing, redeemable or put-able to the issuer thereof at par on or prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount.
(B)

(1) prior to selling any Collateral Debt Obligations and/or Eligible Investments, the Investment Manager certifies to the Trustee that, in its judgment, the aggregate sum of:
(a) expected proceeds from the sale of Eligible Investments; and
(b) for each Collateral Debt Obligation, the product of its Principal Balance and its Market Value, shall be at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount; and
(2) at least five Business Days before the scheduled Redemption Date, the Issuer shall have received proceeds of disposition of all or part of the Portfolio at least sufficient to meet the Redemption Threshold Amount.
(C) At least three Business Days prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, the Collateral Administrator shall give notice to the Trustee in writing of the amount of all expenses that have been or will be incurred by the Issuer up to and including the scheduled Redemption Date in effecting such liquidation.
(D) Any certification delivered by the Investment Manager pursuant to this section must include:
(1) the prices of, and expected proceeds from, the sale (directly or by participation or other arrangement) of any Collateral Debt Obligations and/or Eligible Investments; and
(2) all calculations required by this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) (as applicable).
Any Noteholder, the Investment Manager or any of the Investment Manager’s Affiliates shall have the right, subject to the same terms and conditions afforded to other bidders, to bid for Collateral Debt Obligations to be sold as part of an Optional Redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption in whole of all Classes of Notes Effected through Liquidation only).
If either of the conditions (A) or (B) above are not satisfied, the Issuer shall cancel the redemption of the Notes and shall give notice of such cancellation to the Trustee, the Investment Manager and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). Such cancellation shall not constitute an Event of Default.
(vii) Mechanics of Redemption

Following calculation by the Collateral Administrator of the relevant Redemption Threshold Amount, if applicable, the Collateral Administrator shall make such other calculations as it is required to make pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Investment Manager and the Registrar, whereupon the Registrar shall notify the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) of such amounts.
Any exercise of a right of Optional Redemption by the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or the Controlling Class pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption following a Note Tax Event) shall be effected by delivery to a Transfer Agent, by the requisite amount of Subordinated Noteholders or the requisite amount of Notes comprising the Controlling Class (as applicable) held thereby together with duly completed Redemption Notices not less than thirty calendar days, or such shorter period of time as the Trustee and the Investment Manager find reasonably acceptable, prior to the proposed Redemption Date prior to the applicable Redemption Date. No Redemption Notice, Subordinated Note or Notes comprising the Controlling Class so delivered or any direction given by the Investment Manager may be withdrawn without the prior consent of the Issuer. The Registrar shall copy each Redemption Notice or any direction given by the Investment Manager received to each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty and, if applicable, the Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager shall notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Liquidity Facility Provider, each Hedge Counterparty and the Principal Paying Agent in writing upon satisfaction of all of the conditions set out in this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and shall arrange for liquidation and/or realisation of the Portfolio in whole or in part as necessary, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The Issuer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the funds required for an optional redemption of the Notes in accordance with this Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) in the Payment Account on or before the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date. Principal Proceeds and Interest Proceeds received in connection with a redemption in whole of all the Rated Notes shall be payable in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments. Any redemption in whole of a Class of Rated Notes (other than a redemption in whole of all Classes of Rated Notes) shall be paid to the holders of such Class of Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(viii) Optional Redemption of Subordinated Notes

The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of:
(A) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); and
(B) the Investment Manager.
(c) Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests

(i) Class A Notes and Class B Notes

If the Class A/B Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date or if the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date or any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(ii) Class C Notes

If the Class C Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on or after the Effective Date or if the Class C Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date and any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(iii) Class D Notes

If the Class D Par Value Test is not met on any Determination Date on or after the Effective Date or if the Class D Interest Coverage Test is not met on the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date and any Determination Date thereafter, Interest Proceeds and thereafter Principal Proceeds will be applied in redemption of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, on the related Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the Priorities of Payment (including payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Class D Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.

payment of all prior ranking amounts) until each such Class E Coverage Test is satisfied if recalculated following such redemption.
(d) Special Redemption

Principal payments on the Notes shall be made in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments at the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) if, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) certifies to (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry) the Trustee that using reasonable endeavours it has been unable, for a period of twenty consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its discretion which meet the Eligibility Criteria or, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account that are to be invested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations (a “Special Redemption”). On the first Payment Date following the Due Period in which such certification is given (a “Special Redemption Date”), the funds in the Principal Account representing Principal Proceeds which, using reasonable endeavours, cannot be reinvested in additional Collateral Debt Obligations or Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations (the “Special Redemption Amount”) will be applied in accordance with paragraph (O) of the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Notice of payments pursuant to this Condition 7(d) (Special Redemption) shall be given by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) not less than three Business Days prior to the applicable Special Redemption Date to each Noteholder and to each Rating Agency. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of a Special Redemption shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) and the Investment Manager shall be under no obligation to, or have any responsibility to, any Noteholder or any other person for the exercise or non-exercise (as applicable) of such Special Redemption.
(e) Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event

If as at the Business Day prior to the Payment Date following the Effective Date, an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, in each case, until redeemed in full or, if earlier, until an Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing.
(f) Redemption Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Issuer shall, on each Payment Date occurring thereafter, apply Principal Proceeds transferred to the Payment Account immediately prior to the related Payment Date in redemption of the Notes at their applicable Redemption Prices in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(g) Redemption following Note Tax Event

If a Note Tax Event occurs, the Issuer shall, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, use all reasonable efforts to change the territory in which it is resident for tax purposes to another jurisdiction which, at the time of such change, would not give rise to a Note Tax Event. Upon the earlier of:
(i) the date upon which the Issuer certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry) to the Trustee and the Noteholders that it is not able to effect such change of residence; and
(ii) the date which is ninety calendar days from the date upon which the Issuer first becomes aware of such Note Tax Event (provided that such ninety calendar day period shall be extended by a further ninety calendar days if during the former period the Issuer has notified (or procured the notification of) the Trustee and the Noteholders that, based on advice received by it, it expects that it shall have changed its place of residence by the end of the latter ninety calendar day period),
the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, may elect that the Notes of each Class are redeemed, in whole but not in part, on any Payment Date thereafter, at their respective Redemption Prices in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in which case the Issuer shall so redeem the Notes on such terms, provided that such Note Tax Event would affect payment of principal or interest in respect of the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, the Subordinated Notes (in addition to any other Class of Notes) on such Payment Date; provided further that such redemption of the Notes, whether pursuant to the exercise of such option by the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, shall take place in accordance with the procedures set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).
(h) Redemption

Unless otherwise specified in this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), all Notes in respect of which any notice of redemption is given shall be redeemed on the Redemption Date at their applicable Redemption Prices and to the extent specified in such notice and in accordance with the requirements of this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).
(i) Cancellation and Purchase

All Notes redeemed in full by the Issuer will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.
No Note may be surrendered (including in connection with any abandonment, donation, gift, contribution or other event or circumstance) except for payment as provided herein for cancellation pursuant to paragraph (k) (Purchase) below, for registration of transfer, exchange or redemption, or for replacement in connection with any Note mutilated, defaced or deemed lost or stolen.
(j) Notice of Redemption

The Issuer shall procure that notice of any redemption in accordance with this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) (which notice shall be irrevocable) is given to the Trustee and Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and promptly in writing to the Rating Agencies.
(k) Purchase

On any Payment Date, at the discretion of the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement the Issuer may, subject to the conditions below, purchase any of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part), using Principal Proceeds standing to the credit of the Principal Account or the Collateral Enhancement Account.
No purchase of Rated Notes by the Issuer may occur unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i)

(A) such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur in the following sequential order of priority: first, the Class A Notes, until the Class A Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; second, the Class B Notes, until the Class B Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; third, the Class C Notes, until the Class C Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; fourth, the Class D Notes, until the Class D Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; and fifth, the Class E Notes, until the Class E Notes are redeemed or purchased in full and cancelled; sixth, the Class F Notes, until the Class F Notes are redeemed or purchased in full or cancelled.
(B)

(1) each such purchase of Rated Notes of any Class shall be made pursuant to an offer made to all holders of the Rated Notes of such Class, by notice to such holders, which notice shall specify the purchase price (as a percentage of par) at which such purchase will be effected, the maximum amount of Principal Proceeds and Collateral Enhancement Amounts that will be used to effect such purchase and the length of the period during which such offer will be open for acceptance;
(2) each such holder of a Rated Note shall have the right, but not the obligation, to accept such offer in accordance with its terms; and
(3) if the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes of the relevant Class held by holders who accept such offer exceeds the amount of Principal Proceeds specified in such offer, a portion of the Notes of each accepting holder shall be purchased pro-rata based on the respective Principal Amount Outstanding held by each such holder subject to adjustment for Authorised Denominations if required;
(C) each such purchase shall be effected only at prices discounted from par;
(D) each such purchase of Rated Notes shall occur prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period;
(E) each Coverage Test is satisfied immediately prior to each such purchase and will be satisfied after giving effect to such purchase or, if any Coverage Test is not satisfied it shall be at least maintained or improved after giving effect to such purchase when compared to such Coverage Test immediately prior thereto;
(F) if Sale Proceeds are used to consummate any such purchase, either:
(1) each requirement or test, as the case may be, of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Test (except the S&P CDO Monitor Test) will be satisfied after giving effect to such purchase; or
(2) if any requirement or test, as the case may be, of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Test (except the S&P CDO Monitor Test) was not satisfied immediately prior to such purchase, such requirement or test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such purchase;
(G) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(H) any Rated Notes to be purchased shall be surrendered to the Registrar for cancellation and may not be reissued or resold; and
(I) each such purchase will otherwise be conducted in accordance with applicable law (including the laws of The Netherlands).
Upon instruction by the Issuer, the Registrar shall cancel any such purchased Rated Notes surrendered to it for cancellation. The cancellation (and/or decrease, as applicable) of any such surrendered Rated Notes shall be taken into account for purposes of all relevant calculations.
8 Payments

(a) Method of Payment

Payments of principal upon final redemption in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such Note at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or any Paying Agent by wire transfer. Payments of interest on each Note and, prior to redemption in full thereof, principal in respect of each Note, will be made by wire transfer. Upon application of the holder to the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or any Paying Agent not less than five Business Days before the due date for any payment in respect of a Note, the payment may be made (in the case of any final payment of principal against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only of such final payment, endorsement) of such Note as provided above) by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, on the due date to a Euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in Western Europe.
(b) Payments

All payments are subject in all cases to (i) any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation) and (ii) any withholding or deduction as required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to FATCA. No commission shall be charged to the Noteholders.
(c) Payments on Presentation Days

A holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a Presentation Date and shall not, except as provided in Condition 6 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a Presentation Date falls after the due date.
If a Note is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones it is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.
(d) Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agents

The Issuer reserves the right at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Principal Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent and appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will maintain:
(i) a Principal Paying Agent; and
(ii) a paying agent in an EU member state that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive,
in each case, as approved in writing by the Trustee and shall procure that it shall at all times maintain a Custodian, Account Bank, Investment Manager and Collateral Administrator. Notice of any change in any Agent or their specified offices or in the Investment Manager or Collateral Administrator will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
9 Taxation

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within The Netherlands, or any political sub division or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to gross up any payments made to Noteholders of any Class and shall withhold or deduct from any such payments any amounts on account of such tax where so required by law or any such relevant tax authority or in connection with FATCA (including any voluntary agreement entered into with a tax authority pursuant thereto). Any withholding or deduction shall not constitute an Event of Default under Condition 10(a) (Events of Default).
Subject as provided below, if the Issuer certifies to (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without further enquiry) the Trustee that it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes of any Class become obliged by the laws of The Netherlands to withhold or account for tax so that it would be unable to make payment of the full amount that would otherwise be due but for the imposition of such tax, the Issuer (save as provided below) shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange for the substitution of a company incorporated in another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee as the principal obligor under the Notes of such Class, or to change its tax residence to another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P in relation to such change and in accordance with the Trust Deed.
Notwithstanding the above, if any taxes referred to in this Condition 9 (Taxation) arise:
(a) due to any present or former connection of any Noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Noteholder if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, or a corporation) with The Netherlands (including without limitation, such Noteholder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having had a permanent establishment therein) otherwise than by reason only of the holding of any Note or receiving principal or interest in respect thereof;
(b) by reason of the failure by the relevant Noteholder to comply with any applicable procedures required to establish non residence or other similar claim for exemption from such tax or to provide information concerning nationality, residency or connection with The Netherlands or other applicable tax authority;
(c) in respect of a payment made or secured for the immediate benefit of an individual or a non- corporate entity which is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive or any arrangement entered into between the EU member states and certain third countries and territories in connection with the Directive;
(d) as a result of presentation for payment by or on behalf of a Noteholder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Transfer Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(e) in connection with FATCA (including any voluntary agreement entered into with a tax authority pursuant thereto); or
(f) any combination of the preceding Clauses (a) to (e) inclusive,
the requirement to substitute the Issuer as a principal obligor and/or change its residence for taxation purposes shall not apply.

For the purposes of this paragraph (v) (Breach of Other Obligations), the materiality of such default, breach, covenant, representation or warranty shall be determined by the Trustee;

(ii) Upon any such notice being given to the Issuer of the maturity of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b)(i) (Acceleration), all of the Notes shall immediately become due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices.
(c) Curing of Default

At any time after a notice of acceleration of maturity of the Notes has been given pursuant to Condition 10(b)(i) (Acceleration) following the occurrence of an Event of Default and prior to enforcement of the security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement), the Trustee, subject to receipt of consent from the Controlling Class, may and shall, if so requested by the Controlling Class, in each case, acting by Extraordinary Resolution, (and subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) rescind and annul such notice of acceleration under paragraph (b)(i) above and its consequences if:

The Trust Deed contains provision for the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee and the Rating Agencies on an annual basis and upon request that no Event of Default has occurred and that no condition, event or act has occurred which, with the lapse of time and/or the issue, making or giving of any notice, certification, declaration and/or request and/or the taking of any similar action and/or the fulfilment of any similar condition would constitute an Event of Default and that no other matter which is required (pursuant thereto) to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
11 Enforcement

(a) Security Becoming Enforceable

Subject as provided in paragraph (b) below, the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral (and if applicable, the security constituted by the Euroclear Security Agreement over the Collateral) shall become enforceable upon an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(b) Enforcement

At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution, institute such proceedings or take any other action against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes and pursuant and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes, realise and/or otherwise liquidate or sell the
Collateral in whole or in part and/or take such other action as may be permitted under applicable laws against any Obligor in respect of the Collateral and/or take any other action to enforce or realise the security over the Collateral in accordance with the Trust Deed (such actions together, “Enforcement Actions”), in each case without any liability as to the consequence of such action and without having regard (save to the extent provided in Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)) to the effect of such action on individual Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party, provided however that:
(i) no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless:
(A) the Investment Manager determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) other than the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such amount the “Enforcement Threshold” and such determination being an “Enforcement Threshold Determination”); or
(B) if the Enforcement Threshold will not have been met then:
(1) in the case of an Event of Default specified in paragraph (i), (ii) or (iv) of Condition 10(a) (Events of Default), the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Event of Default; or

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer, in making any modification, amendment, waiver or supplement pursuant to the paragraphs above (other than a modification, waiver or supplement pursuant to paragraphs (i), (x) and (xi) above) to the Transaction Documents, which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee is required (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely without further enquiry and without liability), provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged to agree to any modification which, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the protections, of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents.
In the case of a modification, amendment, waiver or supplement pursuant to paragraphs (i), (x) and (xi) above, the Trustee shall be entitled to obtain expert advice, at the expense of the Issuer, and rely on such advice in connection with giving such consent as it sees fit.
(d) Substitution

The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee to agree, subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed and such other conditions as the Trustee may require (without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class), to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes of each Class, if required for taxation purposes, provided that such substitution would not, in the opinion of the Trustee, be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, but subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P (subject to receipt of such information and/or opinions as S&P may require), to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed, provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. Any substitution agreed by the Trustee pursuant to this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) shall be binding on the Noteholders, and shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may reasonably require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may reasonably direct.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange any material amendments or modifications to the Conditions of the Notes, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to the Irish Stock Exchange.
(e) Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest

In connection with the exercise of its trusts, powers, duties and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)), the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of each Class of Noteholders as a Class and shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise for individual Noteholders of such Class and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 9 (Taxation).
The Trust Deed provides that if there is any conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of:
(i) the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(iv) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders;
(v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; and
(vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders.
If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by principal amount of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater aggregate principal amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that, except as provided otherwise in any applicable Transaction Document or the Conditions of the Notes, the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes.
In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person.
15 Indemnification of the Trustee

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving it from instituting proceedings to enforce repayment or to enforce the security constituted by or pursuant to the Trust Deed, unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document and any entity related to the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document without accounting for any profit. The Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft of the Collateral from any obligation to insure, or to monitor the provisions of any insurance arrangements in respect of, the Collateral (for the avoidance of doubt, under the Trust Deed the Trustee is under no such obligation) and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held by the Custodian or is otherwise held in safe custody by a bank or other custodian. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the performance by the Custodian of any of its duties under the Agency Agreement or for the performance by the Investment Manager of any of its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, for the performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration
Agreement or for the performance by any other person appointed by the Issuer in relation to the Notes or by any other party to any Transaction Document. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for the administration, management or operation of the Collateral including the request by the Investment Manager to release any of the Collateral from time to time.
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement of the Trustee and the removal of the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, but no such retirement or removal shall become effective until a successor trustee is appointed.
16 Notices

Notices to Noteholders will be valid if posted to the address of such Noteholder appearing in the Register at the time of publication of such notice by pre-paid, first class mail (or any other manner approved by the Trustee which may be by electronic transmission) and (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require) shall be sent to the Company Announcements Office of the Irish Stock Exchange or such other process as the Irish Stock Exchange may require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders:
(a) in the case of inland mail, three calendar days after the date of dispatch thereof;
(b) in the case of overseas mail, seven calendar days after the dispatch thereof; or
(c) in the case of electronic transmission, on the date of dispatch.
Notices will be valid and will be deemed to have been given, for so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, when such notice is filed in the Company Announcements Office of the Irish Stock Exchange or such other process as the Irish Stock Exchange may require.
The Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Noteholders (or a category of them) if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the rules of the stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Noteholders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.
17 Additional Issuances

(a) The Issuer may from time to time, subject to the approval of (i) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); (ii) in the case of the issuance of additional Class A Notes, subject to the approval of the Class A Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution); and (iii) the Retention Holder, create and issue further Notes having the same terms and conditions as existing Classes of Notes (subject as provided below) and which shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Outstanding Notes of each such Class (unless otherwise provided), and will use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Debt Obligations, provided that the following conditions are met:
(i) such additional issuances in relation to the applicable Class of Notes may not exceed 100 per cent. in the aggregate of the original aggregate principal amount of such Class of Notes;
(ii) such additional Notes must be issued for a cash sale price and the net proceeds invested in Collateral Debt Obligations or, pending such investment, during the Initial Investment Period deposited in the Unused Proceeds Account or, thereafter, deposited in the Principal Account and, in each case, invested in Eligible Investments;
(iii) such additional Notes must be of each Class of Notes and issued in a proportionate amount among the Classes so that the relative proportions of aggregate principal amount of the Classes of Notes existing immediately prior to such additional issuance remain unchanged immediately following such additional issuance (save with respect to Subordinated Notes as described in paragraph (c) below);
(iv) the terms (other than the date of issuance, the issue price and the date from which interest will accrue) of such Notes must be identical to the terms of the previously issued Notes of the applicable Class of Notes;
(v) the Issuer must notify the Rating Agencies then rating any Notes of such additional issuance and obtain Rating Agency Confirmation (in the case of each Rating Agency, to the extent such Rating Agency is rating any of the Notes);
(vi) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if not satisfied the Coverage Tests will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such additional issuance of Notes;
(vii) the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been notified in writing thirty calendar days prior to such issuance and shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance (the “Anti-Dilution Percentage”) of such additional Notes and on the same terms offered to investors generally;
(viii) (so long as the existing Notes of the Class of Notes to be issued are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange) the additional Notes of such Class to be issued are in accordance with the requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange and are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange (for so long as the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require);
(ix) such additional issuances are in accordance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, the securities and banking laws and regulations of The Netherlands and do not adversely affect the Dutch tax position of the Issuer;
(x) any issuance of additional Notes shall be accomplished in a manner that will allow the Issuer to provide the information described in United States Treasury regulation section 1.1275-3(b)(l) to the holders of such additional Notes;
(xi) the Retention Holder consenting to purchase a sufficient amount of each Class of Notes which are the subject of such additional issuance such that its holding equals no less than 5 per cent. of the nominal value of such Class or Classes of Notes;
(xii) so long as the Issuer has not elected (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption from the Investment Company Act provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act by providing written notice thereof to the Trustee, an opinion of counsel has been delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee confirming that neither the Issuer nor the Portfolio will be required to register under the Investment Company Act as a result of such additional issuance and that the Issuer will continue to be in compliance with the requirements for the registration exemption under Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act after such additional issuance(s); and
(xiii) the Issuer may only issue and sell additional Subordinated Notes three times and on each such occasion the aggregate principal amount of such issuance may not be less than EUR1,000,000.
(b) Noteholders should be aware that additional Notes that are treated for non-tax purposes as a single series with the original Notes may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the new Notes are not fungible with the existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes will be assigned a different CUSIP or other identifier than the existing Notes. In such case, the new Notes may be considered to have been issued with a greater amount of OID (as defined in “Tax Considerations – United States Federal Income Taxation – Interest on the Rated Notes”), which may affect the market value of the original Notes since such additional Notes may not be distinguishable from the original Notes.
(c) Subject to the requirements in (a) above (except for the condition in Condition 17(a)(v)), the Issuer may issue and sell additional Subordinated Notes (without issuing Notes of any other Class) provided that:
(i) the subordination terms of such Subordinated Notes are identical to the terms of the previously issued Subordinated Notes;
(ii) the terms (other than the date of issuance, the issue price and the date from which interest will accrue) of such Subordinated Notes must be identical to the terms of the previously issued Subordinated Notes;
(iii) such additional Subordinated Notes are issued for a cash subscription price, the net proceeds to be:
(A) invested in Collateral Debt Obligations or Eligible Investments or, pending such investment, deposited in, the Unused Proceeds Account prior to the expiry of the Initial Investment Period or the Principal Account after the expiry of the Initial Investment Period and in each case invested in Eligible Investments, provided that the Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall not be obliged to enter into any binding commitments to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations with such proceeds, until such proceeds have been deposited into the Unused Proceeds Account or the Principal Account (as applicable); or
(B) used for other Permitted Uses;
(iv) the Issuer must notify the Rating Agencies then rating any Notes of such additional issuance;
(v) the holders of the Subordinated Notes shall have been notified in writing thirty calendar days prior to such issuance by the Issuer and shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Subordinated Notes in an amount not to exceed the Anti-Dilution Percentage of such additional Subordinated Notes and on the same terms offered to investors generally; and
(vi) such additional issuance is in accordance with all applicable laws including, without limitation, the securities and banking laws and regulations of The Netherlands and do not adversely affect the Dutch tax position of the Issuer.
References in these Conditions to the “Notes” include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other notes issued pursuant to this Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) and forming a single series with the Notes. Any further securities forming a single series with Notes constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental to it shall be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed.
18 Third Party Rights

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or Condition of the Note under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
19 Governing Law

(a) Governing Law

The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Issuer Management Agreement and the Letter of Undertaking are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with Dutch law.
(b) Jurisdiction

The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non- contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process

The Issuer appoints TMF Corporate Services Limited (having an office, at the date hereof, at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, London EC4A 3AE) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer ceases to have such an in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.
USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of (a) certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes payable on or about the Issue Date and following completion of the issue of the Notes (including, without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) and (b) the acquisition costs of any Collateral Debt Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (if applicable), are expected to be approximately €401,500,000. Such remaining net proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account.
FORM OF THE NOTES

References below to Notes and to the Global Certificates and the Definitive Certificates representing such Notes are to each respective Class of Notes, except as otherwise indicated.
Initial Issue of Notes

The Regulation S Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and other than the Retention Notes) will be represented on issue by a Regulation S Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may not be held by a U.S. Person or U.S. Resident at any time. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. Person, and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest only to a person whom the seller reasonably believes (a) to be a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, or (b) to be a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class (other than, in certain circumstances, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes) will be represented on issue by a Rule 144A Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may only be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, amongst other things, that it is a QIB/QP and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
Beneficial interests in Global Certificates will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and as set forth in Rule 144A and the Investment Company Act, and the Notes will bear the applicable legends regarding the restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”. In the case of each Class of Notes, a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate in denominations greater than or equal to the minimum denominations applicable to interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Registrar or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) to the effect that the transferor reasonably believes that the transferee is a QIB/QP and that such transaction is in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificates may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate only upon receipt by the Registrar or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Trust Deed) from the transferor to the effect that the transfer is being made to a non-U.S. Person and in accordance with Regulation S.
Any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate (other than in certain circumstances for the Regulation S Notes which are Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes) that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate and become an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate, and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate for as long as it remains such an interest. Any beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate and become an interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate for so long as it remains such an interest. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
Each initial investor (other than the Initial Purchaser) in a Class E Note, Class F Note or a Subordinated Note purchased on the Issue Date will be required to enter into a subscription agreement (and in the case of the Investment Manager, a note purchase agreement) in which it will certify as to, among other matters, its status under the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA. A transferee of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note (other than a transferee of the Retention Notes) in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate will be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person. If a transferee is unable to make such deemed representation, such transferee (and, in the case of a transfer of the Retention Notes, the proposed transferee of such Notes) may not acquire such Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate unless such transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (substantially in the form of Annex B and as set out in the Trust Deed); and (iii) holds such Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate. Any Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate shall be registered in the name of the holder thereof. Each purchaser and transferee understands and agrees that no transfer of an interest in Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be permitted or recognised if it would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded with respect to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class).
The Subordinated Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes will be offered outside the United States to non-
U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S and within the United States to persons who are both QIBs and QPs. The Notes are not issuable in bearer form.
Amendments to Terms and Conditions

Each Global Certificate contains provisions that apply to the Notes that they represent, some of which modify the effect of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes in definitive form (See “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”). The following is a summary of those provisions:
 Payments Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate will be made to the registered holder and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the relevant Notes, upon surrender of such Global Certificate to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Agent as shall have been notified to the relevant Noteholders for such purpose. On each occasion on which a payment of interest (unless the Notes represented thereby do not bear interest) or principal is made in respect of the relevant Global Certificate, the Registrar shall note the same in the Register and, in relation to payments of principal, cause the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by a Global Certificate to be decreased accordingly.
 Notices So long as any Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Noteholders shall be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for delivery thereof as required by the Conditions of such Notes provided that such notice is also made to the Company Announcements Office of the Irish Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require. Such notice will be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the date of delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system.
 Prescription Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate will become void unless presented for payment within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the date on which any payment first becomes due.
 Meetings The holder of each Global Certificate will be treated as being one person for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each €1,000 of principal amount of Notes for which the relevant Global Certificate may be exchanged.
 Trustee’s Powers In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificates are held on behalf of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to each Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of any Global Certificate.
 Cancellation Cancellation of any Note required by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes to be cancelled will be effected by reduction in the principal amount of the Notes on the Register, with a corresponding notation made on the applicable Global Certificate.
 Optional Redemption The Subordinated Noteholders’, the Retention Holder’s and the Controlling Class’ option in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) and Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) (as applicable) may be exercised by the holder(s) of a Definitive Certificate or a Global Certificate (as applicable) representing Subordinated Notes, the Retention Notes or the Controlling Class (as applicable) giving notice to the Registrar or other Agent specified for such purpose of the principal amount of Subordinated Notes, Retention Notes or Notes representing the Controlling Class (as applicable) in respect of which the option is exercised and presenting such Definitive Certificate or Global Certificate (as applicable) for endorsement of exercise within the time limit specified in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event).
 Record Date The Record Date will mean the close of business on the Clearing System Business Day before the relevant due date for payment of principal and interest in respect of such security
Exchange for Definitive Certificates

Exchange

Each Global Certificate will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Definitive Exchange Date (as defined below), in whole but not in part, for Definitive Certificates if a Global Certificate is held (directly or indirectly) on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or an alternative clearing system and any such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen calendar days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces its intention to permanently cease business or does in fact do so.
Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes may be exchangeable for interests in a Definitive Certificate representing the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes if a transferee is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person provided: (i) such transferee has obtained the consent of the Issuer in respect of such transfer; and (ii) the transferee has provided the Issuer with an ERISA certificate substantially in the form set out in Annex B and as set out in the Trust Deed. Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes may be exchangeable for interests in Definitive Certificates representing Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes as amended above.
The Registrar will not register the transfer of, or exchange of interests in, a Global Certificate for Definitive Certificates during the period from (but excluding) the Record Date to (and including) the date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.
If only one of the Global Certificates (the “Exchanged Global Certificate”) becomes exchangeable for Definitive Certificates in accordance with the above paragraphs, transfers of Notes may not take place between, on the one hand, persons holding Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Exchanged Global Certificate and, on the other hand, persons wishing to purchase beneficial interests in the other Global Certificate.
“Definitive Exchange Date” means a day falling not less than thirty calendar days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar and any Transfer Agent is located.
Delivery

In such circumstances, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any relevant Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with: (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Certificates; and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under “Transfer Restrictions” below.
Legends

The holder of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note represented by a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, may transfer the Notes represented thereby in whole or in part in the applicable minimum denomination by surrendering such Note(s) at the specified office of the Registrar or any Transfer Agent, together with the completed form of transfer and to the extent applicable, consent of the Issuer and a duly completed ERISA certificate substantially in the form of Annex B and as set out in the Trust Deed. Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, bearing the legend referred to under “Transfer Restrictions” below, or upon specific request for removal of the legend on a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, the Issuer will deliver only Definitive Certificates that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act.
Exchange of Definitive Certificates for Interests in Global Certificates

Regulation S

If a holder of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its interest in such Notes to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, such holder may effect such transfer only upon receipt by the Registrar of: (a) notification from the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg of the Regulation S Global Certificate that the appropriate credit entry has been made in the accounts of the relevant participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, (but in no case for less than the minimum authorised denomination applicable to such Notes); and (b) a certificate in the form of part F (Form of Transfer Certificate Relating to Exchange of Definitive Certificate for Regulation S Global Certificate in Respect of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes) of schedule 4 (Transfer, Exchange and Registration Documentation) of the Trust Deed or in such other form as the Registrar, relying upon the advice of counsel, may deem substantially similar in legal effect (a copy of which is provided to the Registrar) given by the holder of the beneficial interests in such Notes.

Each Regulation S Global Certificate and each Rule 144A Global Certificate will have an ISIN and a Common Code and will be registered in the name of, and deposited with, a nominee of the common depositary on behalf of, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

RATINGS OF THE NOTES

General

It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Notes that the Rated Notes be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class A Notes “AAA (sf)” from S&P and “Aaa (sf)” from Moody’s; the Class B Notes: “AA (sf)” from S&P and “Aa2 (sf)” from Moody’s; the Class C Notes: “A (sf)” from S&P and “A2 (sf)” from Moody’s; the Class D Notes: “BBB (sf)” from S&P and “Baa2 (sf)” from Moody’s; the Class E Notes: “BB (sf)” from S&P and “Ba2 (sf)” from Moody’s and the Class F Notes: “B- (sf)” from S&P and “B2 (sf)” from Moody’s. The Subordinated Notes being offered hereby will not be rated.
The S&P ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The S&P ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.
The Moody’s ratings on the Rated Notes are based upon Moody’s assessment of the probability that the Portfolio Obligations will provide sufficient funds to pay the Rated Notes based largely upon Moody’s statistical analysis of historical default notes on debt obligations with various ratings.
In respect of any Notes that are subject to a Refinancing in accordance with Condition 7(b)(v)(C) (Refinancing in relation to a Redemption in Whole), the ratings assigned to the Notes will not necessarily continue to be assigned to the Refinancing Obligations issued pursuant thereto.
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating agency.
As of the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union (“EU”) and is registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (as amended) (the “CRA Regulation”). As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation.
S&P Ratings

S&P will rate the Rated Notes in accordance with its criteria. This requires an analysis of the following:
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Debt Obligations securing the Notes;
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and
(c) legal considerations.
Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied prior to the end of the Reinvestment Period.
S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Investment Manager on or before the Issue Date. The CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Debt Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand. For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.
Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.
There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Investment Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Retention Holder makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.
S&P’s ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Debt Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.
Moody’s Ratings

The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s are based upon its assessment of the probability that the Collateral Debt Obligations will provide sufficient funds to pay each such Class of Notes, based largely upon Moody’s statistical analysis of historical default rates on debt obligations with various ratings, the asset and interest coverage required for the relevant Class of Rated Notes (which is achieved through the subordination of the Subordinated Notes and, in the case of the Class A Notes, subordination of the other Classes of Notes, in the case of the Class B Notes, subordination of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and, in the case of the Class C Notes, subordination of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and, in the case of the Class D Notes, subordination of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and, in the case of the Class E Notes subordination of the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes and, in the case of the Class F Notes, subordination of the Subordinated Notes) and the diversification requirements that the Collateral Debt Obligations are required to satisfy.
Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Debt Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as securities with lower ratings are added to the portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the Rated Notes, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Debt Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.
In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Investment Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that they deem relevant.

Investment Process

The key components of the Investment Manager’s investment process are as follows (all subject to the investment guidelines and policies of the relevant portfolio being managed): (i) sourcing; (ii) due diligence; (iii) suitability assessment; (iv) ongoing monitoring; and (v) portfolio management.
(i) Sourcing

The Investment Manager is one of the largest institutional investors in the European leveraged loan market and is a “one stop shop” for debt financing across the capital structure, with the ability to make large commitments (typically between approximately €20 million and €150 million in a single opportunity) to the investment opportunities it selects. As a result, the Investment Manager has developed strong relationships with corporate borrowers, private equity sponsors, advisers, loan arrangers, and secondary trading houses.
(ii) Due Diligence

The Investment Manager, in reviewing and analysing potential investment opportunities, will draw on external, independent due diligence material as well as the work and experience of Alcentra analysts in the relevant industry sector.
Stage 1 - Initial Due Diligence

An Alcentra industry analyst will prepare an initial report to be submitted to the portfolio manager and Investment Committee in order to determine the suitability of the asset for inclusion in the portfolio, taking into account various factors including:
 industry position;
 company description and history;
 capital structure and leverage;
 yield, price and potential investment return;
 liquidity;
 trading history;
 situation assessment (including ratings outlook, impending financings, earnings shortfalls, current news or outstanding issues);
 cash flow level, consistency and sustainability; and
 operating ratios.
This first stage will culminate in a preliminary screening by the Investment Committee.
Stage 2 - In-Depth Due Diligence Review

If the Investment Committee gives its preliminary approval to the potential investment, the responsible analyst will perform more in-depth due diligence as needed to confirm or reject the investment, including:
 detailed review of structure and documentation, including review of collateral, pledge and security agreements and guarantees;
 further industry review;
 comparative credit review;
 management assessment (focusing on reputation, compensation and board oversight);
 full financial analysis, including review of projections as necessary;
 field visit to plant or facilities; and
 discussions with outside information sources (such as vendors, customers and private equity investors).
The Investment Manager’s internal rating system is an integral component of the due diligence process and will be used to determine a rating for each investment based on proprietary financial analysis. Investment decisions will also be influenced by the investment’s yield compared to its industry sector and the relevant quality rating category assigned by third party credit rating agencies. The rating ascribed to an investment by the Investment Manager is central to the yield comparisons conducted across quality and industry levels.
Following the completion of this in-depth due diligence process, the potential investment will be put before the Investment Committee. All investment ideas must be presented for final approval to the Investment Committee and must receive majority approval (such majority to include the Chairman) before being considered for inclusion in the portfolio. The Investment Committee will meet as required to consider and review any investment proposals.
Stage 3 - Execution Phase

Once the decision has been made to invest, the analyst will work with legal counsel to review all loan documentation from a legal perspective. In conjunction with legal counsel, the Investment Manager has developed a “documents checklist” to assist in identifying potentially damaging clauses, often inserted into loan documentation over the years of the bull market between 2004 and 2007, and bring these to the attention of the Investment Committee.
(iii) Suitability Assessment

In parallel with the due diligence process, the Investment Manager will screen the portfolio to assess the suitability of the asset for inclusion, taking into account the impact on portfolio diversity, potential incremental yield to the portfolio and correlation with similar holdings in the portfolio, with a focus on seeking opportunities that offer adequate compensation for risk.
The suitability assessment will aim to maintain a highly diversified portfolio by considering the impact of the addition of a new asset to portfolio concentration relating:
 to a single borrower;
 to borrowers from a single geographical jurisdiction;
 to an individual industry sector;
 to a specific asset class;
 to seniority of claim in the event of default;
 to foreign currency; and
 to collateral paying a fixed rate of interest.
In each case, concentrations will be monitored with reference to the relevant company’s published investment policy.
(iv) Ongoing Monitoring

The credit analyst responsible for the relevant industry sector or geographical jurisdiction will monitor investments in that sector. Analysts will screen news services daily for relevant updates on their credits. Typically, Alcentra will receive monthly management accounting data from most of the companies to which it lends. The relevant analyst will track monthly data for each borrower using proprietary systems and standardised monitoring reports. In many cases, analysts will regularly meet key executive management in invested companies.
Daily updates will be discussed directly with the portfolio managers and the investment team will meet weekly to discuss developments with respect to portfolio companies. All credits will be reviewed in detail by the Investment Committee at quarterly portfolio reviews. During these reviews, which will typically take up about three days per quarter, each credit analyst will present a detailed update on each credit in his portfolio to the Investment Committee.
(v) Portfolio Management

At any stage of the process, the Investment Manager will, subject as mentioned above, consider a sale of an asset if:
 credit deterioration has been experienced or is expected;
 relative value is identified elsewhere; or
 diversification may be improved by switching to another investment.
If performance of a particular asset deteriorates, the credit analyst may add the asset to a “Watch List” for more detailed monitoring. A credit may be added to a “Watch List” as a result of:
 anticipation of a covenant breach within the next twelve months;
 a material reduction in revenues or earnings that gives cause for concern; or
 a change in market or business dynamics that raises concerns over the long-term earnings prospects for the credit.
The Investment Manager will exercise judgement as to whether to sell a “Watch List” asset ahead of a potential default to hold onto the asset in the expectation of a work out or restructuring and a higher level of recovery over time.
Where required, Alcentra is resourced to take a leading role in the work out process, and has in the last three years taken leadership roles in work out steering committees. The team includes an experienced work out practitioner to handle more complex work out negotiations.

THE PORTFOLIO

Terms used and not otherwise defined herein or in this Offering Circular as specifically referenced herein shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.
Introduction

Pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager is required or, as the case may be, authorised, to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer, in each case to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Investment Manager.
Acquisition of Collateral Debt Obligations

The Investment Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Corporate Rescue Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds during the Initial Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, the Investment Manager on its behalf will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is approximately €300 million, representing approximately 75 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (as defined in the Conditions of the Notes). The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of (a) certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes payable on or about the Issue Date and following completion of the issue of the Notes (including, without duplication, amounts deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) and (b) the acquisition costs of any Collateral Debt Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (if applicable), are expected to be approximately €401,500,000. Such remaining net proceeds shall be retained in the Unused Proceeds Account. During the Initial Investment Period, the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Debt Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account (together with any Collateral Debt Obligations previously acquired).
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Investment Manager may declare that the Initial Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to the Payment Date in October 2014, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
On or after the Effective Date, the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account will be transferred to the Principal Account and/or the Interest Account, in each case, at the discretion of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer), provided that as at such date: (i) the Issuer has acquired or entered into binding commitments to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Debt Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value); and (ii) no more than 1 per cent. of the Target Par Amount may be transferred to the Interest Account.
Within ten Business Days following the Effective Date or, otherwise, as soon as reasonably practicable (which may be longer), the Collateral Administrator shall issue an Effective Date Report containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Debt Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral Debt Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value), copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Investment Manager, any Hedge Counterparty and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments of any Collateral
Debt Obligations subsequent to the Issue Date shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Debt Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) and the Issuer will provide, or cause the Investment Manager to provide to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator an accountants’ certificate confirming the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at such date, the computations and results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests by reference to such Collateral Debt Obligations.
The Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes, provided that if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such rating confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within twenty Business Days following the Effective Date, the Investment Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received (or deemed received) in respect of such failure and either: (i) the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies; or (ii) a Rating Confirmation Plan is presented to the Rating Agencies but a Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan; or (b) Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P has not been received following the Effective Date, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of any of the Initial Ratings of the Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of:
(x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing; and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Investment Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations and/or any other intended action which is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.
“Effective Date Moody’s Condition” means a condition satisfied if: (a) the Trustee is provided with an accountants’ certificate indicating that the Effective Date Determination Requirements are satisfied; and (b) Moody’s is provided with the Effective Date Report.

“Bridge Loan” shall mean any Collateral Debt Obligation that: (a) is incurred in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a person, restructuring or similar transaction;
(b) by its terms, is required to be repaid within one year of the incurrence thereof with proceeds from additional borrowings or other refinancings (provided, however, that any additional borrowing or refinancing having a term of more than one year may be included as a Bridge Loan if one or more financial institutions shall have provided the obligor with a binding written commitment to provide the same); and (c) prior to its purchase by the Issuer, has a S&P Rating and a Moody’s Rating.
“Project Finance Loan” means a loan obligation under which the obligor is obliged to make payments that depend (except for rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of payments) on revenues arising from infrastructure assets, including, without limitation:
(a) the sale of products, such as electricity, water, gas or oil, generated by one or more infrastructure assets in the utility industry by a special purpose entity; and
(b) fees charged in respect of one or more highways, bridges, tunnels, pipelines or other infrastructure assets by a special purpose entity,
in each case, where the sole activity of such special purpose entity is the ownership and/or management of such asset or assets and the acquisition and/or development of such asset by the special purpose entity was effected primarily with the proceeds of debt financing made available to it on a limited recourse basis.
“Synthetic Security” means a security or swap transaction (other than a letter of credit or a Participation) that has payments of interest or principal on a reference obligation or the credit performance of a reference obligation.
“Step-Down Coupon Security” means a security: (a) which does not pay interest over a specified period of time ending on its maturity, but which does provide for the payment of interest before such specified period; or (b) the interest rate of which decreases over a specified period of time other than due to the decrease of the floating rate index applicable to such security.
“Step-Up Coupon Security” means a security: (a) which does not pay interest over a specified period of time ending prior to its maturity, but which does provide for the payment of interest after the expiration of such specified period; or (b) the interest rate of which increases over a specified period of time other than due to the increase of the floating rate index applicable to such security.
“Zero Coupon Security” means a security (other than a Step-Up Coupon Security) that, at the time of determination, does not provide for periodic payments of interest.
Restructured Obligations

If a Collateral Debt Obligation becomes the subject of a restructuring whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Debt Obligation (including but not limited to an amendment of its maturity date) or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor, such obligation shall only constitute a Restructured Obligation if such obligation has an S&P Rating and satisfies each of the criteria comprising the Eligibility Criteria other than the criteria set out at paragraphs (c), (j) and, in respect of a PIK Security only, (ee) and (hh) thereof (such
applicable criteria, the “Restructured Obligation Criteria”). For the avoidance of doubt, a Cashless Loan shall be treated as the acquisition by the Issuer of a new Collateral Debt Obligation and not as the acquisition of a Restructured Obligation. Whilst PIK Securities are not eligible to be Collateral Debt Obligations under the Eligibility Criteria, up to 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance may consist of PIK Securities provided that such PIK Securities are Restructured Obligations only.
“Cashless Loan” means a loan obligation which is the reconstitution of a Collateral Debt Obligation that does not involve the receipt by the Issuer of a principal repayment in exchange for the new loan obligation. For the avoidance of doubt a Collateral Debt Obligation, or Participation thereof that is the subject of a Maturity Amendment (as defined below) shall not by virtue of the Maturity Amendment alone, constitute a Cashless Loan.
Management of the Portfolio

Overview

The Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is permitted, in certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements set out in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, to sell Collateral Debt Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities and to reinvest the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Debt Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Investment Manager) thereof in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) and the Reinvestment Criteria (as applicable).
Prior to the proposed sale of Collateral Debt Obligations and/or Exchanged Equity Securities, or reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, the Investment Manager shall notify the Collateral Administrator of all necessary details of the Collateral Debt Obligation or Exchanged Equity Security proposed to be sold and the proposed Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation to be purchased and the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) shall determine and shall provide confirmation of whether the Portfolio Profile Tests and Reinvestment Criteria which are required to be satisfied in connection with any such sale or reinvestment are satisfied or, if any such criteria are not satisfied, shall notify the Issuer and the Investment Manager of the reasons and the extent to which such criteria are not so satisfied.
The Investment Manager will determine and use reasonable endeavours to cause to be purchased by the Issuer, Collateral Debt Obligations (including all Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations) taking into account the Eligibility Criteria and, where applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), and will monitor the performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations on an ongoing basis to the extent practicable using sources of information reasonably available to it and provided that the Investment Manager shall not be responsible for determining whether or not the terms of any individual Collateral Debt Obligation have been observed.
The activities referred to below that the Investment Manager may undertake on behalf of the Issuer are subject to the Issuer’s monitoring of the performance of the Investment Manager under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
Sale of Collateral Debt Obligations

Sale of Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations

The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) sell any Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligations which do not comply with the Eligibility Criteria on the Issue Date (each a “Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Debt Obligation”). Any Sale Proceeds received in connection therewith may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria (and, where applicable, provided the Trading Requirements are met) or credited to the Principal Account pending such reinvestment.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations

Credit Impaired Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations may be sold in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) at any time by the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) subject to:
(a) to the Investment Manager’s knowledge, having made all reasonable enquiries to ensure the same is true, no Event of Default having occurred which is continuing; and
(b) the Investment Manager certifying to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that it believes, in its reasonable business judgment, that such security constitutes a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation as the case may be, provided that in forming such judgment, a reduction in credit spread or an increase in market value of a Collateral Debt Obligation may only be utilised as corroboration of other bases for such judgment.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Exchanged Equity Securities

Any Exchanged Equity Security may be sold at any time by the Investment Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) and the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Debt Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Investment Manager) reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, subject to, to the Investment Manager’s knowledge, having made all reasonable enquiries to ensure the same is true, no Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
In addition to any discretionary sale of Exchanged Equity Securities as provided above, the Investment Manager shall be required by the Issuer to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell (on behalf of the Issuer) any Exchanged Equity Security which constitutes Margin Stock, as soon as practicable upon its receipt or upon its becoming Margin Stock (as applicable).
Discretionary Sales

The Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) dispose of any Collateral Debt Obligation (other than a Credit Improved Obligation, a Credit Impaired Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation or an Exchanged Equity Security, each of which may only be sold in the circumstances provided above) at any time provided:
(a) no Event of Default has occurred which is continuing;
(b) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance outstanding of all Collateral Debt Obligations sold as described in this paragraph during the preceding twelve calendar months (or, for the first twelve calendar months after the Issue Date, during the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the date of determination) is not greater than 30 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of such twelve calendar month period (or as of the Issue Date, as the case may be);
(c) either:
(i) during the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager reasonably believes prior to such sale that it will be able to enter one or more binding commitments to reinvest all or a portion of the proceeds of such sale in one or more additional Collateral Debt Obligations within forty-five calendar days after the settlement of such sale in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria; or
(ii) at any time, either: (1) the Sale Proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the Principal Balance of such Collateral Debt Obligation; or (2) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding the Collateral Debt Obligation being sold
but including, without duplication, the Sale Proceeds of such sale) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value) plus, without duplication, the amounts on deposit in the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account (including Eligible Investments therein) will be greater than (or equal to) the Reinvestment Target Par Balance (as defined below); and
(d) that the Investment Manager uses all reasonable efforts to reinvest such Sale Proceeds within ninety Business Days of settlement of such sale or, if such sale is effected within the Reinvestment Period, prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period. In relation to reinvestments during the Reinvestment Period, in the event such Sale Proceeds are not reinvested before the Payment Date falling immediately after the end of such ninety Business Day period, such amounts shall only remain credited to the Principal Account, as applicable, for the purpose of reinvestment to the extent no payments are required to be made on such Payment Date in respect of a failure to satisfy any Coverage Test.
Sale of Collateral Prior to Maturity Date

If: (a) any redemption of the Rated Notes in whole is scheduled to occur prior to the Maturity Date; (b) notification is received from the Trustee of enforcement of the security over the Collateral; or (c) the Maturity Date occurs or is shortly to occur, the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) (or in the case of paragraph (b) if requested by the Trustee following the enforcement of such security) shall, as far as practicable, arrange for liquidation of the Collateral in order to procure that the proceeds thereof are in immediately available funds by the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date or Maturity Date as applicable and sell all or part of the Portfolio, as applicable, in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement but without regard to the limitations set out in “Sale of Collateral Debt Obligations” above or the Reinvestment Criteria (which will include any limitations or restrictions set out in the Conditions of the Notes and the Trust Deed).
Reinvestment of Collateral Debt Obligations

“Reinvestment Criteria” means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under “During the Reinvestment Period” below and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. The Reinvestment Criteria shall not apply prior to the Effective Date or in the case of a Collateral Debt Obligation which has been restructured on and following the point at which such restructuring has become binding on the holders thereof (whether or not such obligation would constitute a “Restructured Obligation”), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if a restructured obligation (whether or not constituting a “Restructured Obligation”) is subsequently sold by the Investment Manager or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Scheduled Principal Proceeds are received in connection with such restructured obligation, any reinvestment of the Sale Proceeds, Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Scheduled Principal Proceeds (as applicable) shall be subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
During the Reinvestment Period

During the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, at its discretion, reinvest any Principal Proceeds in the purchase of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria (and, where applicable, provided the Trading Requirements are met) provided that immediately after entering into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Debt Obligation and taking into account existing commitments, the criteria set out below, must be satisfied:
(a) to the Investment Manager’s knowledge, no Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(b) on and after the Effective Date (or in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, the second Payment Date) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if (other than with respect to the reinvestment of any proceeds received upon the sale of, or as a recovery on, any Defaulted Obligation) as calculated immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation the Principal Proceeds of which
are being reinvested, any Coverage Test was not satisfied, the coverage ratio relating to such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment than it was immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation;
(c) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Impaired Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations purchased with such Sale Proceeds shall at least equal such Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Debt Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Debt Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(d) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Improved Obligation either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance immediately prior to the sale of the relevant Credit Improved Obligation; or
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Debt Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Debt Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(e) either: (A) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be satisfied; or (B) if any of the Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests are not satisfied such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the position immediately prior to sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation except that, in the case of a Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Impaired Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation, the S&P CDO Monitor Test will not apply;
(f) the date on which the Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Debt Obligation occurs during the Reinvestment Period; and
(g) with respect to the reinvestment of Sale Proceeds (other than Sale Proceeds from Credit Improved Obligations, Credit Impaired Obligations, Defaulted Obligations and Exchanged Equity Securities) either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance immediately prior to the sale that generates such Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) after giving effect to such sale, the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Debt Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations being purchased and the
anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations) (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and Unused Proceeds Account (including any Eligible Investments (save for interest accrued on Eligible Investments)) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligations for which the trade date has occurred during the Reinvestment Period but which settle after such date, the purchase of such Collateral Debt Obligations shall be treated as a purchase made during the Reinvestment Period for purposes of the Trust Deed.
“Reinvestment Target Par Balance” means, as of any date of determination: (a) the Target Par Amount minus: (b) the amount of any reduction in the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes and plus (c) (i) the Principal Amount Outstanding of any additional Notes issued pursuant to Condition 17 (Additional Issuance), or, if greater, (ii) the aggregate amount of Principal Proceeds that result from the issuance of such additional Notes.
Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, only, may be reinvested by the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in one or more Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria (and, where applicable, provided the Trading Requirements are met), in each case provided that:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations equals or exceeds (1) in the case of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of the related Collateral Debt Obligations that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds, as the case may be and (2) in the case of Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations, such Sale Proceeds;
(b) each Coverage Test is satisfied both before and after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(c) each of the Weighted Average Life Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test and the Portfolio Profile Tests in paragraphs (g) and (h) is satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(d) either: (1) the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests are satisfied (other than with respect to the Weighted Average Life Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test and the Portfolio Profile Tests in paragraphs (g) and (h)) are satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment; or (2) if any such test was not satisfied immediately prior to such reinvestment, such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(e) to the Investment Manager’s knowledge, no Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such reinvestment;
(f) such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation(s) have the same or a higher S&P Rating as the Collateral Debt Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds, as the case may be;
(g) the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of each Substitute Collateral Debt Obligation is the same as or earlier than the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds; and
(h) the Weighted Average Life Test was satisfied on the last Business Day of the Reinvestment Period.
Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above prior to the end of the Due Period in which such proceeds were received shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payment on the following Payment Date (subject as provided in the proviso at the end of this paragraph), save that the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Impaired Obligations and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Improved Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment but for no longer than the later of (A) thirty calendar days following their receipt by the Issuer and (B) the end of the following Due Period; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria are not satisfied as of the Payment Date next following receipt of such Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, all such funds shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments set out in Condition 3(c)(ii) (Application of Principal Proceeds) and such funds shall be applied only in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence.
The Trading Requirements

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) will not acquire (whether by purchase or substitution) or dispose of any Custodial Asset unless the Trading Requirements are satisfied in connection with such acquisition or disposition, provided that at any time, the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) may elect to rely solely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act by written notice thereof to the Trustee in which case, at all times thereafter, there will be no Trading Requirements, and all references to such requirements in the Trust Deed and other Transaction Documents shall no longer be in effect. See “Risk Factors – Issuer Reliance on Rule 3a-7”, “Risk Factors – Non-compliance with restrictions on ownership of the Notes and the Investment Company Act could adversely affect the Issuer” and “Risk Factors – Relating to the Collateral Debt Obligations – The Portfolio”.
“Custodial Assets” means all Collateral Debt Obligations, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Exchanged Equity Securities, Counterparty Downgrade Collateral and Eligible Investments and in each case any sums received in respect thereof held from time to time by the Custodian pursuant to the Agency Agreement.
Amendments to Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturities of Collateral Debt Obligations

The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment: (a) the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity Date of the Rated Notes; and (b) the Weighted Average Life Test is satisfied. If the Issuer or the Investment Manager has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements of this paragraph but the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity has been extended, by way of scheme or arrangement or otherwise, the Issuer or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf may (but shall not be required to) sell such Collateral Debt Obligation provided that in any event the Investment Manager shall dispose of such Collateral Debt Obligation on or prior to the Maturity Date. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
“Maturity Amendment” means with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, any waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of such Collateral Debt Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, a waiver, modification, amendment or variance that would extend the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the credit facility of which a Collateral Debt Obligation is part, but would not extend the Collateral Debt Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Debt Obligation held by the Issuer, does not constitute a Maturity Amendment.
Expiry of the Reinvestment Criteria Certification

Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Debt Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Debt Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Debt Obligations.
Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test

If the Class F Par Value Ratio is less than 104.24 per cent., on the relevant Determination Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account during the Reinvestment Period, for the acquisition of additional Collateral Debt Obligations in an amount (such amount, the “Required Diversion Amount”) equal to the lesser of: (a) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments; and (b) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) to (V) (inclusive) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be met as of the relevant Determination Date after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (W) of the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, such amounts to be applied during the Reinvestment Period to purchase additional Collateral Debt Obligations.
Designation for Reinvestment

After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Investment Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Debt Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (a) Purchased Accrued Interest; (b) any interest received in respect of any Mezzanine Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Deferring Mezzanine Obligation other than Defaulted Mezzanine Excess Amounts; and (c) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.
Accrued Interest

Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Debt Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account at the discretion of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Debt Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds and/or principal amounts from the Unused Proceeds Account shall constitute Purchased Accrued Interest and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
Block Trades

The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations on any day if such Collateral Debt Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria, at the election of the Investment Manager in its sole discretion, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Debt Obligation or a group of Collateral Debt Obligations) identified by the Investment Manager as such at the time (the “Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date”) when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a “Trading Plan”) may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the ten Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the “Trading Plan Period”); provided that:
(a) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Debt Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be its S&P Collateral Value); (b) no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date; (c) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period; and (d) if the Reinvestment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan, but are not satisfied upon the completion of the related Trading Plan, Rating Agency Confirmation is obtained with respect to the effectiveness of additional Trading Plans (it being understood that Rating Agency Confirmation shall only be required once following any failure of a Trading Plan); provided further that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Debt Obligation or Collateral Debt Obligations purchased at separate times for purposes of determining whether any particular Collateral Debt Obligation is a Discount Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria upon completion of a Trading Plan pursuant to paragraph (d) above, shall be calculated with respect to those Collateral Debt Obligations that were actually sold and/or purchased as part of the relevant Trading Plan on the basis of data used as at the Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date.
Eligible Investments

Subject to the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), the Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s), Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account, the Prefunded Commitment Account or the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable). The Liquidity Facility Provider may direct the Investment Manager, in writing, to purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account and the Investment Manager shall comply with any such direction provided such investment satisfies the definition of “Eligible Investment” and shall not be liable to any party for acting in accordance with such direction. For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable).
Collateral Enhancement Obligations

The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time, subject to the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Debt Obligations being so purchased.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of Contributions and the balance standing to the credit of the Collateral Enhancement Account at the relevant time. Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(vi) (Collateral Enhancement Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest and/or principal payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Collateral Enhancement Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations may be sold at any time and all Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests.
Exercise of Warrants and Options

The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may at any time, subject to the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Debt Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall, on behalf of the Issuer, instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment pursuant to a duly completed form of instruction.
Margin Stock

The Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement requires that the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavours to sell any Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Collateral Enhancement Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.
“Margin Stock” means margin stock as defined under Regulation U issued by the Federal Reserve Board, including any debt security which is by its terms convertible into Margin Stock.
Non-Euro Obligations

Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable), the Investment Manager shall be authorised to purchase, on behalf of the Issuer, Non-Euro Obligations from time to time provided that any such Non- Euro Obligation shall only constitute a Collateral Debt Obligation that satisfies paragraph (b) of the Eligibility Criteria if the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Debt Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation, into an Asset Swap Transaction (which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Debt Obligation) pursuant to which the currency risk arising from receipt of cash flows from such Non-Euro Obligations, including interest and principal payments, is hedged through the swapping of such cash flows for Euro payments to be made by an Asset Swap Counterparty. Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) shall be authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, but solely to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Asset Swap Transaction. Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in relation to entry into each Asset Swap Transaction unless such Asset Swap Transaction is a Form-Approved Asset Swap. See the “Hedging Arrangements” section of this Offering Circular.
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations

The Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire Collateral Debt Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations from time to time.
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euros) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.
Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee or other
ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof if any default by the obligor thereof in respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith occurs). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder. Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligations. To the extent required, the Issuer, or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a third party from time to time as collateral for any payment obligations of the Issuer in relation to a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation including but not limited to reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Debt Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt of an Issuer Order (as defined in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement) the Trustee shall be deemed to have released such amounts from the security granted thereover pursuant to the Trust Deed.
Participations

The Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) to time acquire Collateral Debt Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:
(a) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution will not exceed the individual and aggregate percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party (or any guarantor thereof, which must be compliant with S&P’s structured finance rating criteria entitled “Guarantee Criteria—Structured Finance” dated 7 May 2013 and/or any successor, replacement and/or updated criteria from time to time or any related guidance); and
(b) the percentage of the Aggregate Collateral Balance that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions (or any guarantor thereof, which must be compliant with S&P’s structured finance rating criteria entitled “Guarantee Criteria—Structured Finance” dated 7 May 2013 and/or any successor, replacement and/or updated criteria from time to time or any related guidance), each having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating,
and for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation.
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of:
(a) the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);
(b) the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or
(c) such other documentation provided such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as that set out in the Trust Deed.
Assignments

The Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable) acquire Collateral Debt Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Collateral Debt Obligation is acquired by way of Assignment the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Debt
Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
Bivariate Risk Table

The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) and as referred to in “Portfolio Profile Tests” below and “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the Moody’s or S&P ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.

Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests

Measurement of Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Measurement Date (save as otherwise provided herein).
Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which a binding commitment has been made to purchase such Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations but such purchase has not been settled shall nonetheless be deemed to have been purchased for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Debt Obligations in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Tests and Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed. See “Reinvestment of Collateral Debt Obligations” above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Portfolio to meet the requirements of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Debt Obligation from being a Collateral Debt Obligation.
Portfolio Profile Tests

The Portfolio Profile Tests will consist of each of the following:

Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Debt Obligations in the calculation of the Portfolio Profile Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed.
“Annual Obligations” means Collateral Debt Obligations which, at the relevant date of measurement, pay interest less frequently than semi-annually.
Collateral Quality Tests

The Collateral Quality Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) so long as any Notes rated by S&P are Outstanding:
(i) the S&P CDO Monitor Test (from the Effective Date until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period); and
(ii) the S&P Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test;
(b) so long as any Notes rated by Moody’s are Outstanding:
(i) the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test;
(ii) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test; and
(iii) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test;
(c) so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding:
(i) the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test;
(ii) Minimum Weighted Average Fixed Coupon Test; and
(iii) the Weighted Average Life Test,
each as defined in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
Obligations for which the Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to purchase but have not yet settled shall be included for the purposes of calculating the Collateral
Quality Tests at any time as if such purchase had been completed. Collateral Debt Obligations in respect of which the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to sell but which have not yet settled shall be excluded as Collateral Debt Obligations in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Tests at any time as if such sale had been completed.
S&P Matrix

After the Effective Date, S&P will provide the Investment Manager with the Class Break-Even Default Rates for each S&P CDO Monitor based upon portfolios with weighted average spreads, weighted average coupons and recovery rates to be associated with such S&P CDO Monitor as selected by the Investment Manager in accordance with the definition of “S&P CDO Monitor Test” or any other weighted average spreads and recovery rates selected by the Investment Manager from time to time. Each Class Break-Even Default Rate will be determined as follows:
(A) the applicable weighted average spread will be the spread between 2 per cent. and 6 per cent. (in increments of
0.01 per cent.) without exceeding the Non-Adjusted Weighted Average Spread as of such Measurement Date (the “S&P Matrix Spread”) and (B) the applicable weighted average coupon will be the coupon between 6 per cent. and 15 per cent. (in increments of 0.01 per cent.) without exceeding the Non-Adjusted Weighted Average Fixed Rate Coupon as of such Measurement Date (the “S&P Matrix Coupon” and together with the S&P Matrix Spread, the “S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon” ) and (C) the applicable weighted average recovery rate with respect to each Class of Notes, chosen independently, will be the recovery between (i) in the case of the Class A Notes, 20 per cent. and 50 per cent., (ii) in the case of the Class B Notes, 26 per cent. and 60 per cent., (iii) in the case of the Class C Notes, 33 per cent. and 66 per cent., (iv) in the case of the Class D Notes, 38 per cent. and 72 per cent., (v) in the case of the Class E Notes, 43 per cent. and 78 per cent. and (vi) in the case of the Class F Notes, 50 per cent. and 85 per cent. (in each case, in increments of 0.05 per cent.) (the “Recovery Rate Case”) in each case as selected by the Investment Manager.
On and after the Effective Date, the Investment Manager will have the right to choose which Recovery Rate Case for each Class of Notes then rated by S&P (collectively, a “Recovery Rate Set” ) and which S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon will be applicable for purposes of both (i) the S&P CDO Monitor and (ii) the S&P Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test.
After the Effective Date, the Investment Manager may request from time to time for S&P to provide S&P CDO Monitors for up to 50 different combinations of S&P Matrix Spreads and Coupons and Recovery Rate Sets at each request, which may, for example, be two S&P Matrix Spreads and Coupons and 25 Recovery Rate Sets or 10 S&P Matrix Spread and Coupons and 5 Recovery Rate Sets, provided that S&P shall only be required to provide such inputs up to a maximum of 50 different combinations in any twelve month period. On two Business Days’ written notice to the Collateral Administrator (or such shorter time as may be acceptable to the Collateral Administrator), the Investment Manager may choose a different Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon; provided, that the Collateral Debt Obligations must be in compliance with such different Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon and, solely for purposes of this proviso, if the Issuer has entered into a binding commitment to invest in a Collateral Debt Obligation, compliance with the newly selected Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon may be determined after giving effect to such investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Collateral Debt Obligations are not currently in compliance with the Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon then applicable and would not be in compliance with any other Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, the Investment Manager may select a different Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, that is not further out of compliance than the current Recovery Rate Set and S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon.
In the event the Investment Manager fails to choose (A) a Recovery Rate Set on or after the Effective Date, Recovery Rate Cases corresponding to: (i) “AAA” of 39.25 per cent.; (ii) “AA” of 46 per cent.; “A” of 50.75 per cent.; (iii) “BBB” of 56 per cent.; (iv) “BB” of 64.5 per cent.; and (v) “B” of 69 per cent. rating level weighted average recovery rates will apply or (B) an S&P Matrix Spread and Coupon prior to the Effective Date, an S&P Matrix Spread of 4.3 per cent. and an S&P Matrix Coupon of 6.5 per cent. will apply.
Moody’s Test Matrix

Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Investment Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set forth in the matrix to be set out in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement (the “Moody’s Test Matrix”") shall be applicable for purposes of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. For any given case:
1. the applicable column for performing the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in which the elected case is set out;
2. the applicable row and column for performing the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the row and column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable) in which the elected case is set out; and
3. the applicable row for performing the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows, as applicable) in which the elected test is set out.
On the Effective Date, the Investment Manager will be required to elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter, with notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and Moody’s, the Investment Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test applicable to the case to which the Investment Manager desires to change are satisfied or, in the case of any tests that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Investment Manager be obliged to elect to have a different case apply.

Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor

The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test

The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Investment Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Debt Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):
(a) an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;
(b) an “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Debt Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Debt Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Debt Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Debt Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payments, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Debt Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;
(d) an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score is then calculated for each of the 35 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and
(e) an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.

The Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test

The “Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor of the Collateral Debt Obligations as at such Measurement Date is equal to or less than the sum of (i) the number set forth in the Moody’s Test Matrix at the intersection of the applicable "row/column" combination chosen by the Investment Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)) (acting on behalf of the Issuer) as at such Measurement Date plus (ii) the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment.
The “Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor” is determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Debt Obligation, excluding Defaulted Obligations, by its Moody’s Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balances of all such Collateral Debt Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations, and rounding the result up to the nearest whole number.
The “Moody’s Rating Factor” relating to any Collateral Debt Obligation is the number set forth in the table below opposite the Moody’s Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation.

(d) if there is not a rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be determined (other than in the case of Corporate Rescue Loans) pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (iii) below:
(i) if an obligation of the issuer is not a Corporate Rescue Loan and is publicly rated by Moody’s, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodology for establishing the

(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by S&P, and in connection therewith, the Issuer, the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer or the issuer of such Collateral Debt Obligation shall, prior to or within thirty calendar days after the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation, apply (and concurrently submit all available Information in respect of such application) to S&P for a credit estimate which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, if such information is submitted within such thirty calendar day period, then, for a period of up to ninety calendar days after acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation by the Issuer and pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, such Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating as determined by the Investment Manager in its sole discretion if (A) the Investment Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Investment Manager is commercially reasonable, will be at least equal to such rating and (B) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Debt Obligations subject to a S&P Rating determined by the Investment Manager in accordance with (A) does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Aggregate Collateral Balance (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation will be its S&P Collateral Value); provided further that (x) if such information is not submitted within such thirty calendar day period and (y) following the end of the ninety calendar day period set forth above, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-”; unless, in the case of clause (y) above, during such ninety calendar day period, the Investment Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided further that if the Collateral Debt Obligation has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a credit estimate in respect of such Collateral Debt Obligation, the S&P Rating in respect thereof shall be “CCC-” pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, and S&P may elect not to provide such estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided further that such credit estimate shall expire twelve months after the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation, following which such Collateral Debt Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-” unless, during such twelve-month period, the Issuer (or the investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) applies for renewal thereof in accordance with the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement in which case such credit estimate shall continue to be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Debt Obligation; provided further that such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall expire on the next succeeding twelve-month anniversary of the date of the acquisition of such Collateral Debt Obligation and (when renewed annually in accordance with the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement) on each twelve-month anniversary thereafter,
provided that, if the applicable rating assigned by S&P or Moody’s to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch positive”, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category above such assigned rating and if the applicable rating assigned by S&P or Moody’s to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch negative”, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

Fees

As compensation for the performance of its investment management services under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager (and/or, at its direction, an Affiliate of the Investment Manager) will receive from the Issuer, in arrear on each Payment Date, an investment management fee equal to 0.15 per cent. per annum of the Aggregate Collateral Balance measured as of the beginning of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date, which investment management fee will be payable senior to the Notes, but subordinated to certain fees and expenses of the Issuer (such fee, the “Senior Investment Management Fee”).
The Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement also provides that the Investment Manager (and/or, at its direction, an Affiliate of the Investment Manager) will receive from the Issuer, in arrear on each Payment Date, an investment management fee equal to 0.35 per cent. per annum of the Aggregate Collateral Balance measured as of the beginning of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date, which investment management fee will be payable senior to the payments on the Subordinated Notes, but subordinated to the Rated Notes (such fee, the “Subordinated Investment Management Fee”).
Each of the Senior Investment Management Fee and the Subordinated Investment Management Fee shall be calculated semi-annually during a Frequency Switch Period (except, in certain circumstances, in respect of the first Payment Date following the Frequency Switch Period) and quarterly at all other times and, in each case, on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Due Period.
In addition to the Senior Investment Management Fee and the Subordinated Investment Management Fee, the Investment Manager (and/or, at its direction, an Affiliate of the Investment Manager) will receive a junior investment management fee equal to 0.10 per cent. per annum (accruing from the Issue Date, but for the avoidance of doubt, on a simple and not a compounding basis) of the Aggregate Collateral Balance measured as of the beginning of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date, payable (in arrear) on each Payment Date as provided below and subject to the Priorities of Payment, if the Junior Investment Management Fee IRR Threshold has met or exceeded 12 per cent., in an amount equal to up to 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds, Principal Proceeds and Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (such fee, the “Junior Investment Management Fee”).
Each of the Senior Investment Management Fee, the Subordinated Investment Management Fee and the Junior Investment Management Fee shall be calculated based upon the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Due Period divided by 360.
The Investment Manager may participate in creditors’ committees with respect to the bankruptcy, restructuring or work-out of issuers of Collateral Debt Obligations. In such circumstances, the Investment Manager may take positions on behalf of itself or Related Entities that are adverse to the interests of the Issuer in the Collateral Debt Obligations. The Investment Manager will be entitled to receive any steering committee fees (except any fees received in connection with the extension of the maturity of a Defaulted Obligation or a reduction in the outstanding principal balance of a Defaulted Obligation) received in connection with the work-out or restructuring of any Defaulted Obligations or Collateral Debt Obligations.
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Investment Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Investment Management Fee equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Subordinated Investment Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Subordinated Investment Management
Fee equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.
The Investment Manager may elect to defer any Senior Investment Management Fees or Subordinated Investment Management Fees. Any amounts so deferred shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Any due and unpaid Investment Management Fees including Deferred Senior Investment Management Amounts and Deferred Subordinated Investment Management Amounts shall not accrue any interest.
Cross Transactions

The Investment Manager and its Affiliates may at certain times seek to purchase or sell investments from or to the Issuer as principal. Under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager, at its option and sole discretion, may effect principal transactions between such entities. In addition, the Investment Manager and its Affiliates will be authorised to engage in certain cross transactions, including “agency cross” transactions (i.e., transactions in which either the Investment Manager or one of its Affiliates or another person acts as a broker for both the Issuer and another person on the other side of the same transaction, which person may be an account or client for which the Investment Manager or any Affiliate serves as investment adviser). The Issuer has agreed to permit cross transactions; provided that such consent can be revoked at any time by the Issuer and to the extent that the Issuer’s consent with respect to any particular cross transaction is required by applicable law.
By purchasing a Note, a holder shall be deemed to have consented to the procedures described herein relating to cross transactions and principal transactions. The Investment Manager or its Affiliates may receive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both parties to any such principal transaction or cross transactions. See “Risk Factors – Relating to certain conflicts of interest – Investment Manager”.
Standard of Care of the Investment Manager

Pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager will agree with the Issuer that it will perform its obligations, duties and discretions under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, with reasonable care, in a manner consistent with practices and procedures followed by reputable institutional managers of international standing relating to assets of the nature and character of the Portfolio assets and with respect to an entity intended not to be engaged in U.S. trade or business, and to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the Investment Manager will follow its customary standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement (the “Standard of Care”).
The Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement contains provisions which require that the Investment Manager will cause any purchase of or entry into or sale, termination or other disposal of Portfolio assets or other “eligible asset” (as defined in Rule 3a-7) to be effected:
(a) on an arm’s length basis; and
(b) in accordance with the Trading Requirements (so long as they are applicable).
Additionally, the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement contains provisions which require that the Investment Manager shall not take any action on behalf of the Issuer which it knows would, due to a change in law subsequent to the date of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the Standard of Care, the Investment Manager is required under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement to take reasonable care to ensure that no action is taken (save for any action which is expressly contemplated in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement) which
would adversely affect in a material respect the Issuer, but the Investment Manager and/or its Affiliates shall not be prohibited in this respect from carrying on its (or their) ordinary business in good faith.
Responsibilities of the Investment Manager

The Investment Manager will have no responsibility under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and, subject to the Standard of Care described above:
(a) shall not be responsible for any action it takes, on behalf of the Issuer, in compliance with the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement;
(b) shall not be responsible for any action or inaction by the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee in following or declining to follow any direction, advice, recommendation or instruction of the Investment Manager;
(c) does not assume any fiduciary duty or responsibility with regard to the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholder or any other person;
(d) does not guarantee or otherwise assume any responsibility for the performance of the Notes, the Portfolio, any Collateral Debt Obligation or the performance by any third party of any contract entered into on behalf of the Issuer or, except as expressly set forth under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, any obligation of any other party;
(e) shall not incur any liability in acting upon any publicly available information published or provided to it in relation to the Collateral in the absence of actual knowledge of the Investment Manager to the contrary, save for manifest error;
(f) shall, in the absence of manifest error, incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, statement, notice, resolution, request, direction, consent, order, report, opinion, bond or other document, paper or data reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be properly executed or signed or originated by the proper party or parties; and
(g) shall be entitled to rely, in the absence of manifest error, upon the accuracy and completeness of notices and other information supplied by the Collateral Administrator.
In situations where a conflict of interest arises between the Issuer and the Investment Manager, neither the Investment Manager nor any of its clients, partners, members or their employees and their Affiliates has any duty to act in a way that is favourable to the Issuer or to offer any particular investment opportunity to the Issuer.
The Investment Manager, as well as its directors, employees, officers, shareholders and agents, shall not be liable (whether directly or indirectly, in contract or in tort or otherwise) to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other person for losses, claims, damages, judgments, interest on judgments, assessments, costs, fees, charges, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities (collectively “Liabilities”) incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders or any other person that arise out of or in connection with the performance by the Investment Manager of its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement provided that nothing shall relieve the Investment Manager from liability to such persons for Liabilities they may incur:
(a) by reason of acts or omissions constituting fraud, wilful misconduct or negligence of the Investment Manager under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Trust Deed or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party;
(b) with respect to the information concerning the Investment Manager provided in writing to the Issuer by the Investment Manager expressly for inclusion in the Preliminary Offering Circular and this Offering Circular, such information containing any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
(c) with respect to any unauthorised offers or solicitations to investors by the Investment Manager or any other material breach by the Investment Manager of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Investment Manager be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits) even if the Investment Manager has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
Subject to the Standard of Care specified above, the Investment Manager (any Affiliates of the Investment Manager, and their shareholders, directors, officers, members, attorneys, advisors, agents and employees) will be entitled to indemnification by the Issuer in relation, inter alia, to the performance of the Investment Manager’s obligations under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, which will be payable in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Resignation of the Investment Manager

The Investment Manager may resign, subject to the appointment of a successor investment manager, with or without cause upon at least ninety calendar days’ prior written notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Noteholders (in accordance with the Conditions) and each Rating Agency. The Investment Manager may resign its appointment upon shorter notice whether or not a successor investment manager has been appointed where there is a change in law or the application of any applicable law which makes it illegal for the Investment Manager to carry on its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. Any such resignation is without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Investment Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention Notes for so long as the Investment Manager is also the Retention Holder (unless the same are transferred in compliance with the provisions of the Risk Retention Letter).
Investment Manager Tax Event

The Investment Manager may be removed by the Issuer (regardless of whether or not a successor investment manager has been appointed) if it has not changed the location from which it provides its investment management services under the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or otherwise remedied or eliminated the occurrence of an Investment Manager Tax Event, in each case, within ninety calendar days of the date that the Investment Manager first becomes aware of an Investment Manager Tax Event (where “Investment Manager Tax Event” means that the Issuer has become subject either to any:
(a) United Kingdom tax liability; or
(b) U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (or there being a substantial likelihood that the Issuer will become subject such U.S. federal income tax),
where the amount of such tax liability is in a sufficient amount such that the Class E Par Value Test would not be satisfied if calculated assuming payment by the Issuer of such tax liability (in each case, provided that such ninety calendar day period shall be extended by a further ninety calendar days if the Investment Manager has notified the Issuer and the Trustee in writing before the end of the first ninety calendar day period that it expects to have changed the place from which it provides its investment management services under the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or that it is otherwise able to remedy or eliminate the circumstances giving rise to such Investment Manager Tax Event).
Removal for Cause

The Investment Manager may, subject to the appointment of a successor Investment Manager in accordance with the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, be removed for Cause upon at least thirty calendar days’ prior written notice:
(a) by the Issuer at its discretion; and
(b) subject to such appointment and notice, by the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed in writing by the holders of:
(i) the Subordinated Notes, acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution; or
(ii) the Controlling Class, acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution,
(for the avoidance of doubt, in each case excluding any Notes held by the Investment Manager or any Affiliate of the Investment Manager, any director, officer or employee of such entities or any fund or account for which the Investment Manager or its Affiliates exercises discretionary voting authority on behalf of such fund or account in respect of the Notes (an “Investment Manager Related Person”), provided that notice of such removal shall have been given to the holders of each Class of the Notes by the Issuer or the Trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with the Trust Deed.
For the purposes of determining “Cause” with respect to termination of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement such term shall mean any one of the following events:
(a) that the Investment Manager wilfully violated a material provision of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed applicable to it (unrelated to the economic performance of the Collateral Debt Obligations);
(b) that the Investment Manager breached in any respect any material provision of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement as is applicable to it (other than as specified in paragraph (a) above) which breach:
(i) has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or the interests of the Noteholders of any Class; and
(ii) if capable of being cured, is not cured within thirty calendar days of the Investment Manager becoming aware thereof or the Investment Manager’s receipt of written notice of such breach from the Issuer or the Trustee;
(c) the failure of any representation, warranty, certification or statement made or delivered by the Investment Manager in or pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed to be correct in any material respect when made and such failure:
(i) has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or interests of the Noteholders of any Class; and
(ii) such failure is not remedied within thirty calendar days after the Investment Manager becoming aware of, or its receipt of written notice from the Issuer or the Trustee of, such failure;

(ii) applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the appointment of a receiver, administrator, trustee, assignee, custodian, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Investment Manager or of any substantial part of its properties or assets, or authorises such an application or consent, or proceedings seeking such appointment are commenced against the Investment Manager without such authorisation, consent or application and either continue undismissed for sixty calendar days or any such appointment is ordered by a court or regulatory body having jurisdiction;
(iii) authorises or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the application of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, readjustment of debt, insolvency, dissolution, or similar law, or authorises such application or consent, or proceedings to such end are instituted against the Investment Manager without such authorisation, application or consent and remain undismissed for sixty calendar days or result in adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or the issuance of an order for relief; or
(iv) permits or suffers all or any substantial part of its properties or assets to be sequestered or attached by court order and the order (if contested in good faith) remains undismissed for sixty calendar days;
(f) the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of Condition 10 (Events of Default) (except in those circumstances where such Event of Default is solely attributable to the actions or omissions of a third party which the Investment Manager does not control); and
(g) the occurrence of an act by the Investment Manager (or any senior officer of the Investment Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the Investment Manager’s obligations under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or its other investment management activities, or the Investment Manager (or any senior officer of the Investment Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) being found guilty of having committed a criminal offence materially related to the management of investments similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral.
Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, if any of the events specified in paragraphs (a) to (g) (inclusive) occurs, the Investment Manager shall, upon becoming aware of the same, be required to give prompt written notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Rating Agencies and the Noteholders (in accordance with the Conditions).
No Voting Rights

Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Investment Manager or any Investment Manager Related Person will have no voting rights with respect to any vote (or written direction or consent) in connection with:
(a) the removal of the Investment Manager; or
(b) the assignment or delegation by the Investment Manager of its obligations under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement,
and will be deemed not to be Outstanding in connection with any such vote, provided, however, that any Notes held by the Investment Manager and/or any Investment Manager Related Person will have voting rights (including in respect of written directions and consents) with respect to all other matters as to which Noteholders are entitled to vote.
Delegation, Assignment or Transfer

The Investment Manager, without the prior consent of the Issuer, any Noteholder or the Trustee, may employ third parties, including its Affiliates, to render asset management services (including investment advice) and assistance in connection with its obligations under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, provided that any such party has the regulatory capacity, as a matter of Dutch law, to provide such services to Dutch residents. In such event, the Investment Manager shall not be relieved of any of its duties or liabilities under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement regardless of the performance of any services by third parties and shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses payable to any such third party except to the extent such expenses are payable by the Issuer under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
The Investment Manager may not assign, delegate or transfer its material rights or material responsibilities under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement without the written consent of:
(a) the Issuer;
(b) either:
(i) the holders of the Rated Notes, acting by Ordinary Resolution, voting together as a single class; or
(ii) the holders of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution; and
(c) the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution,
in each case excluding the Notes held by the Investment Manager or any Investment Manager Related Persons and subject to receipt by the Issuer of a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such assignment, transfer or delegation and provided that such assignee, transferee or delegate has the Dutch regulatory capacity to provide the services provided under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement to Dutch residents such as the Issuer provided further that, to the extent permitted by the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, such consent and Rating Agency Confirmation shall not be required in the case of any assignment to a Permitted Assignee (as defined below); provided further that, if such transferee, assignee or delegate is to be the relevant retention party for the purposes of the Retention Requirements, the appointment of such transferee, assignee or delegate is permitted under and contemplated by the Risk Retention Letter, permitted under the Retention Requirements and would not cause the transactions described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements. A “Permitted Assignee”, for the purposes of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, means an Affiliate of the Investment Manager that certifies in writing (upon which certification the Trustee may rely absolutely) to the Trustee and the Issuer that:
(a) it is legally qualified and has the Dutch regulatory capacity to act as investment manager under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement;
(b) it employs (directly or indirectly) the principal personnel performing the duties required under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement (or persons of similar expertise) prior to such assignment;
(c) the appointment of it will not cause either of the Issuer or the Collateral to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act;
(d) the appointment and conduct of it will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Investment Management Fees becoming subject to value added or similar tax or cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer; and
(e) if the Retention Notes are to be transferred to an Affiliate which is part of the same consolidated accounting group of the Investment Manager, the transfer of the Retention Notes to such entity is permitted in accordance with the Retention Requirements and would not cause the transactions described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements.
The Issuer may not assign its rights under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement without the prior written consent of the Investment Manager, the Trustee, the holders of each Class of Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution, each voting as a separate class, and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation and to such transferee or delegate having the requisite Dutch regulatory capacity, except in the case of an assignment by the Issuer: (a) to an entity that is a successor to the Issuer permitted under the Trust Deed; or (b) to the Trustee.
Appointment of Successor

Upon any removal or resignation of the Investment Manager (except in the circumstances where it has become illegal for the Investment Manager to carry on its duties under the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and except as provided for under an Investment Manager Tax Event as described above), the Investment Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor investment manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. The successor investment manager will be selected by the Issuer subject to: (a) the approval of the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Ordinary Resolution; (b) the successor investment manager demonstrating an ability to professionally and competently perform duties similar to those imposed upon the Investment Manager pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement and has a substantially similar (or better) level of experience; (c) for so long as the Rated Notes are outstanding, the holders of the Controlling Class do not object within thirty calendar days after the giving of notice thereof in accordance with the Conditions of such proposed selection by the Issuer; (d) the appointment of which will not cause either of the Issuer becoming, or require the pool of Collateral to be required to be registered under the Investment Company Act; (e) receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation; (f) if it is to be the relevant retention party for the purposes of the Retention Requirements, the transfer of the Retention Notes to such entity is permitted under and contemplated by the Risk Retention Letter, permitted under the Retention Requirements and would not cause the transactions described in this Offering Circular to cease to be compliant with the Retention Requirements; and (g) such successor investment manager being legally qualified and having the requisite Dutch regulatory capacity to act as investment manager. If the holders of Subordinated Notes do not approve the successor investment manager pursuant to paragraph (a) above, or the Controlling Class object to the Issuer’s selection of successor investment manager pursuant to paragraph (b) above, then the Issuer may propose an alternative successor investment manager. If no successor investment manager has been appointed within one hundred and twenty calendar days or if the Investment Manager is required to resign as a result of illegality or due to an Investment Manager Tax Event, the Issuer (subject to the approval of the Controlling Class, acting by Ordinary Resolution) shall appoint a successor investment manager which satisfies the criteria specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement subject to receipt of (i) Rating Agency Confirmation and (ii) provided that no Retention Event has occurred and is continuing, the approval in writing of the Retention Holder.
Upon notice of removal or resignation of the Investment Manager

If the Investment Manager has received notice that it will be removed or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor investment manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Investment Manager:
(a) will not acquire on behalf of the Issuer any Collateral Debt Obligations (except for trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation);
(b) will only execute sales of Margin Stock, Credit Impaired Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).
Any such resignation or removal of the Investment Manager or termination of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement shall be without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Investment
Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention Notes for so long as the Investment Manager is also the Retention Holder (unless the same have been validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the Risk Retention Letter).
Termination and Resignation of Appointment of the Collateral Administrator

Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement, the Collateral Administrator may be removed: (a) without cause at any time upon at least ninety calendar days’ prior written notice by the Issuer at its discretion or the Trustee if so directed by the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution and subject to the Trustee being secured and/or indemnified and/or prefunded to its satisfaction; or (b) with cause upon at least ten calendar days’ prior written notice by the Issuer at its discretion or the Trustee if so directed by the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution and subject to the Trustee being secured and/or indemnified and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. In addition, the Collateral Administrator may also resign its appointment without cause on at least forty-five calendar days’ prior written notice and with cause upon at least ten calendar days’ prior written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee. No resignation or removal of the Collateral Administrator will be effective until a successor collateral administrator has been appointed pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.

The following description of the Liquidity Facility Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not defined in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

Each Subsequent Drawdown may be drawn on two Business Days’ written notice prior to the relevant Repayment Date and shall not exceed the lesser of:
(a) the Liquidity Facility Available Commitment on the day such Liquidity Drawing is to be made (taking into account any Liquidity Drawings scheduled to be repaid on or prior to the Drawdown Date of such Subsequent Drawdown and subject to the receipt of confirmation from the Collateral Administrator that there will be sufficient amounts available in the Interest Account to make such repayment in full on such date); and
(b) the amount of the Initial Drawdown which such Subsequent Drawdown is refinancing, subject to the limits set out in the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

Subject to the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Provider shall make each Liquidity Drawing available to the Issuer by 12.00 noon (London time) on the relevant Drawdown Date.
Liquidity Facility Events of Default

Each of the following shall be a “Liquidity Facility Event of Default” under the Liquidity Facility Agreement:
(a) failure to pay principal when due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement (subject, where such non- payment is as a result of an administrative error or omission of certain parties, to a seven Business Day
grace period and provided however that any failure to repay any Liquidity Drawing on a Repayment Date due to there being insufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds pursuant to Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) or the Priorities of Payment (as applicable) shall not constitute an event of default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement unless that Repayment Date is also the Liquidity Facility Termination Date or the Liquidity Facility Available Commitment has otherwise been reduced to zero in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement);
(b) failure to pay interest when the same becomes due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement due to there being insufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds, provided such failure to pay continues for a period of at least: (i) ten Business Days if such interest is due on a day which is not a Payment Date pursuant to Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) and (ii) five Business Days if such interest is due on a Payment Date;
(c) failure to pay fees when the same become due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement due to there being insufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds, provided such failure to pay continues for a period of at least five Business Days;
(d) it is or becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform any of its obligations under the Liquidity Facility Agreement and certain related documents;
(e) insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer; and
(f) an Acceleration Notice with respect to the Notes is served on the Issuer in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) of the Notes,
provided that, with respect to a failure to pay any principal, interest and/or fees, if there are sufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds and such payment is not made when due pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, such non-payment shall constitute a Liquidity Facility Event of Default (subject, where such non- payment is a result of an administrative error or omission of certain parties, to a seven Business Day grace period).
Repayment

The Issuer shall be required to repay each Liquidity Drawing then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment on a Payment Date and shall otherwise repay each Liquidity Drawing on the relevant Repayment Date for such Liquidity Drawing (which repayment may be effected by way of a refinancing thereof under a Subsequent Drawdown). Repayment of a Liquidity Drawing on a Repayment Date shall be made:
(a) if such Repayment Date is a Payment Date, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; and
(b) otherwise, pursuant to Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account),
in each case to the extent that there are sufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds (as applicable) available on the relevant Repayment Date to pay such amounts pursuant to the Priorities of Payment or Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) (as applicable), provided however that any failure to repay any Liquidity Drawing on a Repayment Date due to there being insufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds pursuant to Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) or the Priorities of Payment (as applicable) shall not constitute an event of default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement (unless that Repayment Date is also the Liquidity Facility Termination Date or the Liquidity Facility Available Commitment has otherwise been reduced to zero in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement) but such Liquidity Drawing will at all times remain due and payable by the Issuer and shall be paid as soon as the Issuer has sufficient Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds (as applicable) to effect such repayment pursuant to the Priorities of Payment and/or Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account). Each Subsequent Drawdown made by the Issuer shall be applied in repayment (in whole or in part) of the related Initial Drawdown or, if applicable, any Subsequent Drawdown refinancing the same or refinancing any earlier Subsequent Drawdown.
In addition to the above, the Issuer will also be required to repay each Liquidity Drawing then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) on the Liquidity Facility Termination Date in accordance with (and at the times and to the extent stipulated by) the applicable Priorities of Payment and any other relevant provision of the Trust Deed or the Conditions of the Notes.
Indemnity

The Issuer shall indemnify the Liquidity Facility Provider on the terms set out in the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
Prefunded Commitment

The Liquidity Facility Available Commitment will be automatically utilised and drawn down (such drawing, a “Prefunded Commitment Utilisation”) if on any day the Liquidity Facility Provider does not meet the Rating Requirement and the Liquidity Facility Provider has not, within the expiry of the relevant remedy period specified in the Liquidity Facility Agreement, transferred all of its rights and obligations to a replacement Liquidity Facility Provider that meets the Rating Requirement and is acceptable to the Issuer and the Investment Manager in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
The Liquidity Facility Provider shall advance the required amount to the Issuer through its facility office on the Prefunded Commitment Date and upon receiving a Prefunded Commitment Utilisation the Issuer shall forthwith credit the amount received to the Prefunded Commitment Account. Any amounts standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments by the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer at the direction (if any) of the Liquidity Facility Provider, in accordance with the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
The Issuer shall have full legal and beneficial title to the amounts from time to time standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account subject to the right of the Liquidity Facility Provider to be repaid amounts standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement. Without prejudice thereto, the Issuer shall only make withdrawals from the Prefunded Commitment Account in accordance with Condition 3(j)(xi) (Prefunded Commitment Account) and the amount of a Liquidity Facility Provider’s Prefunded Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of such withdrawals and any such withdrawal shall be deemed to be a Liquidity Drawing.
Any Prefunded Commitment (or part thereof) shall be repaid to the Liquidity Facility Provider together with accrued interest thereon as follows:
(a) on the Liquidity Facility Termination Date;
(b) on the first Business Day after the Liquidity Facility Provider has given notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Investment Manager that the Liquidity Facility Provider either satisfies the Rating Requirement or has transferred its rights and obligations to a replacement liquidity facility provider meeting the Rating Requirement in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement;
(c) on the first Business Day after the Liquidity Facility Provider has caused an entity meeting the Rating Requirement to guarantee (in a form which is compliant with S&P’s structured finance rating criteria entitled “Guarantee Criteria—Structured Finance” and dated 7 May 2013 and/or any successor, replacement and/or updated criteria from time to time or any related guidance) in respect of its obligations in a form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee; and
(d) on any day on which the Liquidity Facility Commitment is reduced, cancelled or transferred, in an amount equal to the proportion of such Liquidity Facility Commitment so reduced, cancelled or transferred.
Interest on Drawings, Commitment Fees and Default Interest

A commitment fee shall be payable by the Issuer equal to a rate of 0.50 per cent. per annum on an amount equal to the Liquidity Facility Available Commitment accruing on each day during the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period. Any accrued commitment fee is also payable to the Liquidity Facility Provider on the cancelled amount of the Liquidity Facility Commitment at and up to the time the cancellation takes effect. Accrued and unpaid commitment fees on the Liquidity Facility Available Commitment shall be payable by the Issuer in arrear on each Payment Date to the extent that there are sufficient Interest Proceeds and, if required, Principal Proceeds or the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment or at any time specified in accordance with the provisions of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
The rate of interest on each Initial Drawdown and Subsequent Drawdown for each interest period is the rate per annum determined by the Liquidity Facility Provider to be the aggregate of (a) 2.25 per cent. (the “Liquidity Margin”) and (b) EURIBOR (as defined in the Liquidity Facility Agreement) for the relevant interest period. Accrued interest on any Liquidity Drawing shall be payable on the Repayment Date in respect of such Liquidity Drawing. Any interest or fees payable pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
If the Issuer fails to pay:
(a) any Liquidity Drawing on its Repayment Date in full; and
(b) any other amount payable by it under the Liquidity Facility Agreement,
it shall forthwith, on demand by the Liquidity Facility Provider, pay interest on the overdue amount (calculated daily) from the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, after as well as before judgment, at a rate equal to 2 per cent. per annum plus the Liquidity Margin above EURIBOR (where EURIBOR is calculated by the Liquidity Facility Provider for the purposes of such default interest on an overnight basis pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement).
For so long as a Prefunded Commitment does not become a Liquidity Drawing, interest on the Prefunded Commitment is payable to the Liquidity Facility Provider in arrear on each Payment Date in an amount equal to the interest earned on the amount of the Prefunded Commitment standing to the credit of the Prefunded Commitment Account (including interest on any Eligible Investments standing to the credit thereof) which is received by the Issuer.
Arrangement Fee

An arrangement fee will be payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date to the Liquidity Facility Provider in the amount of €10,000.
Priority of Amounts Due to the Liquidity Facility Provider under the Liquidity Facility Agreement

Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account), on any Repayment Date in respect of a Liquidity Drawing (and/or on any Business Day following such Repayment Date to the extent not paid in full on such Repayment Date) which (in each case) is not also:
(a) a Payment Date; or
(b) the Liquidity Facility Termination Date,
the Issuer shall repay such Liquidity Drawing (to the extent not discharged by way of a Subsequent Drawdown) and any Liquidity Facility Interest Amounts accrued but unpaid in respect of such Liquidity Drawing, in each case from the Interest Account. Pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Provider acknowledges to the Trustee that it is bound by the terms of the Trust Deed and confirms that, notwithstanding any provision of the
Liquidity Facility Agreement to the contrary, no sum, whether in respect of principal or interest or other liabilities under the Liquidity Facility Agreement, shall be paid by the Issuer except in accordance with (and at the time and to the extent stipulated by) Condition 3(j)(ii) (Interest Account) or the Priorities of Payment (as applicable) and any other relevant provision of the Trust Deed or the Conditions of the Notes.
Pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, interest and commitment fees due and payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement, together with the repayment of Liquidity Drawings, will rank prior to all amounts payable in respect of the Notes. All other amounts payable under the Liquidity Facility Agreement such as expenses and indemnification amounts will constitute Administrative Expenses and as such will be payable prior to payment of any amounts in respect of the Notes but only to the extent that such amounts do not exceed the Senior Expenses Cap applicable to the relevant Payment Date. All amounts payable in excess of such cap will be payable after payment of amongst other things:
(a) amounts payable in the event of an Effective Date Rating Event; and
(b) Trustee Fees and Expenses not paid by reason of the Senior Expenses Cap.
Cancellation by the Liquidity Facility Provider

The Liquidity Facility Commitment may only be cancelled by the Liquidity Facility Provider (in whole or in part) by notice if:
(a) a Liquidity Facility Event of Default occurs and is continuing; or
(b) it becomes unlawful in any jurisdiction for the Liquidity Facility Provider to give effect to any of its obligations as contemplated by the Liquidity Facility Agreement or to fund or maintain any Liquidity Drawings, provided that prior to any such cancellation:
(i) the Liquidity Facility Provider is obligated pursuant to the Liquidity Facility Agreement to notify the Issuer accordingly (with such notice copied to the Investment Manager, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator); and
(ii) if circumstances arise which would result in the giving by the Liquidity Facility Provider of notice pursuant to (i) above, then the Liquidity Facility Provider shall consult with the Issuer and any Rating Agencies which are then rating the Rated Notes with a view to identifying reasonable steps that may be open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances, provided that the Liquidity Facility Provider shall be under no obligation to take any such steps.
Notwithstanding any such cancellations by the Liquidity Facility Provider, the repayment or prepayment of any existing Liquidity Drawings and interest thereon shall not be made until the next following Payment Date.
Cancellation by the Issuer

The Liquidity Facility Commitment may be cancelled at the option of the Issuer in whole or in part at any time upon no less than five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) to the Liquidity Facility Provider (copied to the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Rating Agencies and, as applicable, the Issuer or the Investment Manager), provided that a Rating Agency Confirmation is received from each of the Rating Agencies then rating the Rated Notes in respect thereof. No requests for Liquidity Drawings or, as the case may be, withdrawals from the Prefunded Commitment Account purporting to draw all or any part of the amount the subject of such notice of such cancellation may be made during such five Business Day notice period.
The Liquidity Facility Commitment may be cancelled in whole but not in part at the option of the Issuer without consent of any party at any time upon no less than five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) to the Liquidity Facility Provider (copied to the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Rating Agencies and, as applicable, the Issuer or the Investment Manager) if, pursuant to the Liquidity Facility
Agreement, the Issuer is required to pay amounts to the Liquidity Facility Provider in respect of the Liquidity Facility Provider’s increased costs (including taxes). No Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in respect of such cancellation but the Issuer shall provide notice of such cancellation to each Rating Agency.
Increased Costs

The Issuer will be liable to compensate the Liquidity Facility Provider for certain breakage and increased costs, including in respect of FATCA, the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III.
Notwithstanding the delivery of any notice requesting a cancellation of the Liquidity Facility Commitment as a result of the Issuer being required to pay amounts to the Liquidity Facility Provider in respect of the Liquidity Facility Provider’s increased costs (including taxes) in accordance with the Liquidity Facility Agreement, no such cancellation of the Liquidity Facility Commitment in whole shall take effect until the next following Payment Date. Requests for Liquidity Drawings may continue to be made by, and Liquidity Drawings may continue to be required to be paid to, the Issuer pending such cancellation.
Costs and Expenses

Costs and expenses payable by the Issuer shall include, without limitation, legal fees and disbursements in connection with the preparation, negotiation and closing of the documentation for the Liquidity Facility Agreement and the enforcement and protection of Liquidity Facility Provider’s rights with respect to the Liquidity Facility Agreement.
Assignment

The Liquidity Facility Provider may transfer its interest under the Liquidity Facility Agreement provided the transferee is a financial institution satisfying the Rating Requirement, is a “professional market party” for Dutch banking regulatory purposes and the prior written consent of the Issuer, the Investment Manager and the Trustee is obtained, such consent (in the case of the Issuer and the Investment Manager) not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No such consent is required from the Issuer or the Investment Manager where an Event of Default or a Liquidity Facility Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
Replacement and Additional Liquidity Facilities

Under the Liquidity Facility Agreement the Issuer will covenant not to enter into any additional liquidity facility arrangements at any time prior to the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date.
If a Replacement Liquidity Facility is to be entered into on or following the Liquidity Facility Commitment Period End Date, it must be a condition of such Replacement Liquidity Facility that any outstanding Liquidity Drawings with the existing Liquidity Facility Provider will be repaid in full.
HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS

The following is a summary of the principal terms of the hedging arrangements to be entered into by the Issuer on either or about the Issue Date and/or thereafter. The following is a summary only and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive description of the detailed provisions of such documents (copies of which are available from the registered office of the Issuer). The following is a general description of the Hedge Agreements. Any Hedge Agreement may include terms which vary from the descriptions set out below.

Trading Requirements

The Issuer will not acquire (whether by purchase or substitution) or dispose of a Collateral Debt Obligation or an Eligible Investment unless the following conditions (the “Trading Requirements”) are satisfied in connection with such acquisition or disposition:
(a) a Collateral Debt Obligation or Eligible Investment, if being acquired by the Issuer, is an “eligible asset” under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act;
(b) such Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Eligible Investment is being acquired or disposed of in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Trust Deed and the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement;
(c) the acquisition or disposition of such Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Eligible Investment does not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then-current rating issued by any Rating Agency on any Class of Notes (other than the Subordinated Notes) then outstanding; and
(d) such Collateral Debt Obligation, Exchanged Equity Security or Eligible Investment is not being acquired or disposed of for the primary purpose of recognising gains or decreasing losses resulting from market value changes,
provided that at any time, the Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) may elect to rely solely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act by written notice thereof to the Trustee in which case, at all times thereafter, there will be no Trading Requirements.
Hedge Agreements

With respect to a Hedge Agreement, subject to: (a) either (i) such Hedge Agreement complying with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time of entry into such Hedge Agreement; or (ii) the Issuer obtaining legal advice in respect of such Hedge Agreement from reputable international legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not in respect of a CPO, and should not in respect of a CTA, cause the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA; and (b) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, either (i) such Hedge Agreement complying with the Trading Requirements and the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable international legal counsel that the acquisition of or entry into such Hedge Agreement will not eliminate the Issuer’s ability to rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, the Issuer may enter into hedging arrangements to hedge the interest rate and currency risk in respect of the Portfolio on the Issue Date and/or upon acquisition of applicable Collateral Debt Obligations. The Issuer will obtain Rating Agency Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless such arrangements are documented by way of a Form Approved Hedge Agreement.
Form Approved Hedge Agreements

If a Rating Agency announces that the rating criteria applicable to Hedge Agreements has been modified such that a Hedge Agreement no longer constitutes a Form Approved Hedge Agreement then the Issuer or the Investment Manager on its behalf shall seek approval of a new form from the relevant Rating Agencies.
Currency Hedging Arrangements

Asset Swap Agreements

The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase Non-Euro Obligations provided that the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, as soon as practicable following entry into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Debt Obligation and no later than the settlement date of the acquisition of the relevant Collateral Debt Obligation, into an Asset Swap Transaction which shall relate to the purchased Collateral Debt Obligation (to become effective on or before the settlement date of such Collateral Debt Obligation) with an Asset Swap Counterparty pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made to fund the Issuer’s acquisition of the related Non-Euro Obligation and the final and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.
Transactions entered into under an Asset Swap Agreement are documented in confirmations to such Asset Swap Agreement. Each transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to an Asset Swap Agreement (each an “Asset Swap Transaction”). An Asset Swap Transaction, if entered into, will be:
(a) used to hedge the currency (and if applicable, interest rate) mismatch between the Notes and any Non-Euro Obligations and for no other purpose; and
(b) other than in the case of a Form Approved Asset Swap, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof.
Further, each Asset Swap Counterparty will be required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement (taking into account any guarantor thereof) and must have the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents. No Asset Swap Transaction may be entered into if, at the time of entry into such transaction, there is a withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax required in respect of any payments by either party to such Asset Swap Transaction. The Investment Manager shall be required to terminate any Asset Swap Transaction at the time it sells an Asset Swap Obligation. Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms, resulting in either (a) the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Asset Swap Obligation (or the par value thereof) from the Issuer (which shall be funded outside the Priorities of Payment from the Asset Swap Account) and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition thereof) to the Issuer or
(b) the Issuer retaining the proceeds of sale of the Asset Swap Obligation (which shall be converted into Euro and paid into the Principal Account in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes) net of any payments due to the Asset Swap Counterparty in connection with the termination of the Asset Swap Transaction in such circumstances (which the Issuer shall pay to the Asset Swap Counterparty on the date such payment is due in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement). Furthermore, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Asset Swap Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, in which case any Asset Swap Termination Payment would be paid in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral which is required to be returned to an Asset Swap Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payment in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement).
If, following the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes, the Asset Swap Counterparty elects not to early terminate any Asset Swap Transaction, such Asset Swap Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, resulting in the Asset Swap Counterparty receiving the proceeds of the sale of the Non-Euro Obligation from the Issuer and returning the Sale Proceeds (in accordance with
paragraph (b) of the definition thereof, for the avoidance of doubt, net of any termination cost in respect of the early termination of the Asset Swap Transaction, as determined and incurred by the Asset Swap Counterparty in accordance with the Asset Swap Agreement) to the Issuer.
Replacement Asset Swap Transactions

If any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each as defined in the applicable Asset Swap Agreement) the Issuer, or the Investment Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction within thirty calendar days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which satisfies, among other things, the applicable Rating Requirement and which has the regulatory capacity, as a matter of Dutch law, to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.
If any Asset Swap Transaction terminates in the circumstances referred to above, any Asset Swap Termination Receipt will be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and shall be applied towards the costs of entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, together with, where necessary, Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that are available for such purpose on any Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation, save:
(a) where termination of the Asset Swap Transaction occurs on a Redemption Date pursuant to Conditions 7(a) (Final Redemption), Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (other than in connection with a Refinancing),
Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or Condition 10 (Events of Default); or
(b) to the extent that such Asset Swap Termination Receipt is not required for application towards any Asset Swap Replacement Payment,
in which event such Asset Swap Termination Receipt shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
If the Issuer receives any Asset Swap Replacement Receipt upon entry into a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction, such amount shall be paid into the relevant Hedge Termination Account and applied directly by the Collateral Administrator acting on the instructions of the Investment Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in payment of any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable upon termination of the Asset Swap Transaction being so replaced. To the extent not fully paid out of Asset Swap Replacement Receipts, any Asset Swap Termination Payment payable by the Issuer shall be paid to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty on the next Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. To the extent not required for making any such Asset Swap Termination Payment, such Asset Swap Replacement Receipts shall be paid into the Principal Account and shall constitute Unscheduled Principal Proceeds.
The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Replacement Asset Swap Transaction at the time the Investment Manager sells an Asset Swap Obligation. Upon the sale of an Asset Swap Obligation, the Replacement Asset Swap Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Subject to paragraph (a) above, if a Replacement Asset Swap Transaction cannot be entered into in such circumstances, the Investment Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell the applicable Non-Euro Obligation, pay the proceeds thereof to the applicable Asset Swap Counterparty, to the extent required pursuant to the terms of such Asset Swap Transaction and/or to the extent not so required, shall direct the Collateral Administrator to convert all of such proceeds into Euro at the Applicable Exchange Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account. If such proceeds are insufficient to pay any Asset Swap Termination Payments in full, such amount, including any Defaulted Hedge Termination Payment, shall be paid out of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds on the next following Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) may enter into any additional Interest Rate Hedge Transactions from time to time in order to hedge any interest rate mismatch between the Rated Notes and the Collateral Debt Obligations and for no other purpose, subject to the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof and provided that the Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and has the regulatory capacity, as a matter of Dutch law, to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents. The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction at the time the interest rate mismatch is resolved or it sells the related Collateral Debt Obligations. At such time, the Interest Rate Hedge Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreements

If an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each such term as defined in the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Agreement), the Issuer, or the Investment Manager on its behalf, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within thirty calendar days of termination thereof with an Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty which satisfies the applicable Ratings Requirement and which has the regulatory capacity, as a matter of Dutch law, to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents. The Issuer (or the Investment Manager on its behalf) shall be required to terminate any Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction at the time the interest rate mismatch is resolved or it sells the related Collateral Debt Obligation. At such time, the Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction relating thereto shall be terminated on or prior to such sale in accordance with its terms.
Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria

The Investment Manager shall only cause the Issuer to enter into a Hedge Agreement that: (a) either (i) complies with the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria at the time of entry into such Hedge Agreement; or (ii) in respect of which, the Issuer obtains legal advice of reputable international legal counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements shall not in respect of a CPO, and should not in respect of a CTA, require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA; and (b) unless and until the Issuer elects (which election may be upon the advice of the Investment Manager) to rely solely on the exemption under Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, either (i) complies with the Trading Requirements and the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria; or (ii) in respect of which the Issuer obtains legal advice from reputable international legal counsel that the acquisition of or entry into such Hedge Agreement will not eliminate the Issuer’s ability to rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act.
The “Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria” shall be contained in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement.
If a responsible representative of the Investment Manager with knowledge of the Portfolio has actual knowledge of any change in law or regulation that would lead him or her to reasonably question the viability of the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria mentioned above, the Investment Manager shall cause the Issuer to seek a bring-down opinion in respect of such Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria opinion delivered on the Issue Date (or, if a prior bring-down opinion or modification opinion has been issued, then a bring-down of such opinion or equivalent opinion, as the case may be). If the Investment Manager cannot obtain such a bring-down or equivalent opinion on the basis of the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria it shall not cause the Issuer to enter into any further Hedge Agreements unless in respect of any such further Hedge Agreement it obtains legal advice of reputable legal counsel that such Hedge Agreement shall not in respect of a CPO, and should not in respect of a CTA, cause the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA.
Notwithstanding anything in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed to the contrary, the Investment Manager may unilaterally elect to modify the Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria without the consent of any other party so long as it causes the Issuer to obtain an opinion from reputable legal counsel that Hedge Agreements entered into in compliance with such modified Hedge Agreement Eligibility Criteria shall not in respect of a CPO, and should not in respect of a CTA, cause the Issuer, its directors or officers or the Investment Manager or its Affiliates to be required to register with the CFTC and/or the United States National Futures Association with respect to the Issuer as a CPO and/or a CTA.

In addition, the Investment Manager shall only permit the Issuer to enter into a Hedge Agreement that complies with the requirements of the Hedging Condition. The Issuer will obtain Rating Agency Confirmation prior to entering into any hedging arrangements after the Issue Date unless it is in a form which the Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has previously received Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof. Any Hedge Agreement being entered into shall be incidental to the purchase of a specified Collateral Debt Obligation and entered into at the time of such purchase, unless such Hedge Agreement is a Replacement Asset Swap Agreement or a Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreement, in which case it shall be entered into as described above in “Replacement Asset Swap Agreements” and “Replacement Interest Rate Hedge Agreement”, respectively. All Hedge Agreements shall be terminated in accordance with their terms no later than the sale or disposal of the related Collateral Debt Obligation.
Standard Terms of the Hedge Agreements

Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is agreed by the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty and subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof.
Gross up

Under each Hedge Agreement neither the Issuer nor the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder if there is any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments. Any such event may however result in a “Tax Event” which is a “Termination Event” for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. If a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement) occurs, each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant Affected Party (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours to: (a) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (b) (in the case of the Issuer) transfer its residence for tax purposes to another jurisdiction or if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation).
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition

The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse).
Termination Provisions

Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of the following events (which may include without limitation):
(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account any applicable grace period;
(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or to perform its obligations under, the applicable Hedge Agreement;
(d) the principal due in respect of the Notes is declared to be due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, and the Trustee has started to sell all or part of the Collateral as a consequence thereof;
(e) the Notes are redeemed in whole prior to the Maturity Date (otherwise than as a result of an Event of Default thereunder);
(f) representations related to certain regulatory matters prove to be incorrect when made, if the Issuer becomes subject to AIFMD, or if the Issuer or the Investment Manager is required to register as a “commodity pool operator” pursuant to the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended;
(g) regulatory changes occur which have a material adverse effect on a Hedge Counterparty; and
(h) material changes are made to the Transaction Documents without the consent of a Hedge Counterparty which could have a material adverse effect on the Hedge Counterparty.
A termination of a Hedge Agreement does not constitute an Event of Default under the Notes, though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an “additional termination event” under a Hedge Agreement.
Asset Swap Agreements may also contain provisions which allow an Asset Swap Transaction to terminate upon the occurrence of certain credit events related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These credit events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Debt Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation. In such instances the related Asset Swap Transaction would terminate and the Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on its behalf) may need to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation unless a new Asset Swap Transaction can be entered into.
Rating Downgrade Requirements

Each Hedge Agreement shall contain the terms and provisions required by the Rating Agencies for the type of derivative transaction represented by the Hedge Transactions if the Hedge Counterparty or, as relevant, its guarantor, is subject to a voting withdrawal or downgrade by a Rating Agency to below the applicable Rating Requirement. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.
Transfer and Modification

The Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge Agreement following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.
Governing Law

Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder in each case, including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England.

Further, for so long as any of the Notes are Outstanding, the Monthly Report and the Payment Date Report will be available for inspection at the offices of, and copies thereof may be obtained free of charge upon request from, the Issuer.
TAX CONSIDERATIONS

1. General

Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.
Potential purchasers who are in any doubt about their tax position on purchase, ownership, transfer or exercise of any Note should consult their own tax advisers. In particular, no representation is made as to the manner in which payments under the Notes would be characterised by any relevant tax authority. Potential investors should be aware that the relevant fiscal rules or their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, and that this summary is not exhaustive. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice or a guarantee to any potential investor of the tax consequences of investing in the Notes.
2. Netherlands Taxation

The comments below are of a general nature based on taxation law and practice in The Netherlands as at the date of this Offering Circular and are subject to any changes therein, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and does not purport to describe all possible tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder of Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as holders that are subject to taxation in Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba or trusts or similar arrangements) may be subject to special rules. The following is a general description of certain tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes and so should be treated with appropriate caution. In particular, it does not take into consideration any tax implications that may arise on a substitution of the Issuer. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding and/or selling Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.
Please note that with the exception of the section on withholding tax below, the summary does not describe The Netherlands tax consequences for holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest or deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet Inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together with his/her partner (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5 per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding share capital of that company or of 5 per cent. or more of the issued and outstanding share capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or (ii) holds rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest; or (iii) holds certain profit sharing rights in that company that relate to 5 per cent. or more of the company’s annual profits and/or 5 per cent. or more of the company’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest arises if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a non-recognition basis.
Under the existing laws of The Netherlands:
(a) all payments of interest and principal by the Issuer under the Notes can be made free of withholding or deduction for any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by The Netherlands or any political subdivision or tax authority thereof or therein;
(b) a holder of a Note who derives income from a Note or who realises a gain on the disposal or redemption of a Note will not be subject to Dutch taxation on such income or capital gain, unless:
(i) the holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands or, where the holder is an individual, such holder has elected to be treated as a resident of The Netherlands; or
(ii) such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is either effectively managed in The Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands; or
(iii) the holder is an individual and such income or gain qualifies as income from activities that exceed normal active portfolio management in The Netherlands;
(c) Dutch gift, estate or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the occasion of the transfer of a Note by way of gift by, or on the death of, a holder unless:
(i) the holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions; or
(ii) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or as a gift made by or on behalf of a person who, at the time of the gift or death, is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions;
(d) there is no Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in The Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the execution, delivery and/or enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of The Netherlands) of the Notes or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes;
(e) there is no Dutch value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a Note, provided that Dutch value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Dutch value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or are deemed to be rendered, in The Netherlands and an exemption from Dutch value added tax does not apply with respect to such services; and
(f) a holder of a Note will not be treated as a resident of The Netherlands by reason only of the holding of a Note or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the Notes.
3. United States Federal Income Taxation

(a) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Circular 230 Disclosure

Pursuant to U.S. Internal Revenue Service Circular 230, we hereby inform you that the description set out herein with respect to U.S. federal tax issues was not intended or written to be used, and such description cannot be used, by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding any penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under the Code. Such description was written to support the marketing of the Notes. Taxpayers should seek advice based on the taxpayer’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

(b) General

ALL PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ “UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION - INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX” AND “FATCA” BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND MATERIAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO COMPLY WITH SUCH OBLIGATIONS.
This is a discussion of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, disposition, and retirement of the Notes.
Except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder based on such holder’s particular circumstances, nor
does it address any aspect of state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws or the possible application of U.S. federal gift or estate taxes. In particular, except as expressly set out below, this discussion does not address aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special treatment, including holders that:
(i) are broker-dealers, securities traders, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, financial institutions, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies or grantor trusts;
(ii) certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
(iii) hold Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion,” “integrated transaction” or “constructive sale” with other investments; or
(iv) own or are deemed to own 10 per cent. or more, by voting power or value, of the equity of the Issuer (including Subordinated Notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
This discussion considers only holders that will hold Notes as capital assets and whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. This discussion is generally limited to the tax consequences to initial holders that purchase Notes upon their initial issue at their initial issue price.
For purposes of this discussion, “U.S. Holder”, is defined as the beneficial owner of a Note who or which is:
(i) a citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii) a corporation created or organised under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein;
(iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source; or
(iv) a trust, (i) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii)(A) if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust; and (B) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
The term “non-U.S. Holder” means, for purposes of this discussion, a beneficial owner of the Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity treated as a partnership.
If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to its consequences.
This discussion is based upon the Code, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, each as available and in effect as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. Furthermore, there are no cases or rulings by the IRS addressing entities similar to the Issuer or securities similar to the Notes. As a result, the IRS might disagree with all or part of the discussion below. No rulings will be requested of the IRS regarding the issues discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Notes.
Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisor concerning the application of U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the laws of any state or local tax jurisdiction, to their particular situation.
(c) United States Taxation of the Issuer

The Issuer intends to conduct its affairs in a manner designed to prevent the Issuer from being treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States for U.S federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this summary assumes that the Issuer will not be so treated. Prospective investors should be aware, however, that no opinion of counsel or ruling from the IRS will be sought regarding this, or any other, aspect of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Issuer. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree. If the IRS were successfully to assert that the Issuer is engaged in a U.S. trade or business there could be material adverse financial consequences to the Issuer and to persons who hold the Notes. In such a case, the Issuer would be potentially subject to substantial U.S. federal income tax and, in certain circumstances interest payments by the Issuer under the Notes could be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The imposition of any of the foregoing taxes would materially affect the Issuer’s ability to pay principal, interest, and other amounts owing in respect of the Notes. In light of the intended activities of the Issuer, the remainder of this summary assumes that the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Each holder and beneficial owner of a Subordinated Note that is not a “United States person” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) will make, or by acquiring such Note or an interest therein will be deemed to make, a representation to the effect that either (i) it is not a bank for purposes of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code), or (ii) it is a person that is eligible for benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that eliminates U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. source interest not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States.
(d) Characterisation of the Notes

The Issuer intends to treat the Rated Notes as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and this summary assumes such treatment. By acquiring an interest in a Rated Note, the holder will agree to treat such Rated Note as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective investors should note, however, that the classification of an instrument as debt or equity is highly factual, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend, and that a court will not ultimately hold, that one or more classes of Rated Notes, particularly the more junior classes of Rated Notes, are equity.
If the IRS were to challenge the treatment of the Rated Notes and such challenge succeeded, the affected Notes would be treated as equity interests and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in those Notes would be the same as those described below with respect to investments in the Subordinated Notes. Holders of the Notes should note that no rulings have been or will be sought from the IRS with respect to the classification of the Notes or the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed below, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will not take a contrary position to any of the views expressed herein. The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. By acquiring an interest in a Subordinated Note, the holder will agree to treat such Subordinated Note as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This summary assumes such treatment.
(e) U.S. Holders

(i) Interest on the Rated Notes

A U.S. Holder of a Rated Note that uses the cash method of accounting must include in income the U.S. dollar value of Euro payments of qualified stated interest when received. Euro interest received is translated at the U.S. dollar spot rate of Euro on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder therefore generally will not have foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of a Euro interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss upon disposing of the Euro received. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single rate or, under certain conditions discussed below, at a variable rate.
The Rated Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, OID is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of a debt instrument over its “issue price”, if that excess equals or exceeds ¼ of 1 per cent. of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity or weighted average maturity in the case of instalment obligations (the “OID de minimis amount”). The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a debt instrument such as the Rated Notes is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Rated Note other than “qualified stated interest” payments. The “issue price” of a Rated Note generally is the first offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt instrument is sold.
Prospective U.S. Holders should note that interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and Class F Notes may be added to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes where non- payment of such interest results from a shortfall of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds. Consequently, such interest is not unconditionally payable in cash or property at least annually and will not be treated as “qualified stated interest”. Therefore, all of the stated interest payments on each of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity of such Notes, and as a result each of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes will be treated as issued with OID.
If a U.S. Holder holds a Rated Note with OID (an “OID Note”) such U.S. Holder may be required to include OID in income before receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. If the U.S. Holder is an initial purchaser of an OID Note, the amount of the OID includible in income is the sum of the daily accruals of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which such U.S. Holder held the OID Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the OID Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between: (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the OID Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period); and (b) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of an OID Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the OID Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments the U.S. Holder received on the OID Note that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, the U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.
A U.S. Holder of a Rated Note that uses the accrual method of accounting or any U.S. Holder required to accrue OID will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of Euro interest or OID accrued during the accrual period. An accrual basis U.S. Holder with respect to such interest or any U.S. Holder with respect to OID, may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest or OID, as the case may be, using either of two methods, in either case regardless of whether the payments are in fact converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest or OID is translated at the average Euro rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder can elect to accrue interest or OID at the Euro spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the partial period within the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five business days of the receipt of such interest, the spot rate on the date of receipt of interest or OID. An election to accrue interest at the spot rate generally will apply to all foreign currency denominated debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a U.S. Holder may have additional foreign currency gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the Euro received. An accrual method U.S. Holder of a Rated Note or any U.S. Holder required to accrue OID will recognise foreign currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest or OID received to the extent that the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate on the date the interest or OID is received differs from the rate at which the interest or OID was accrued.
The Rated Notes may be debt instruments described in section 1272(a)(6) of the Code (debt instruments that may be accelerated by reason of the prepayment of other debt obligations securing such debt instruments). Special tax rules principally relating to the accrual of OID, market discount, and bond premium apply to debt instruments described in section 1272(a)(6). Further, those debt instruments may not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as part of an integrated transaction with a related hedge under Treasury regulation section 1.1275-6. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effects of section 1272(a)(6) of the Code.
Each class of Rated Notes will be “variable rate debt instruments” if such class of Rated Notes (a) has an issue price that does not exceed the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes by more than an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 0.015 multiplied by the product of such total non- contingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity of such class of Rated Notes; and (ii) 15 per cent. of the total non-contingent principal payments on such class of Rated Notes; (b) provide for stated interest (compounded or paid at least annually) at the current value of one or more qualified floating rates, including the EURIBOR rate on such class of Rated Notes; and (c) does not provide for any principal payments that are contingent. The Rated Notes will qualify as variable rate debt instruments, provided the issue price is not more than 115,000 Euros per 100,000 Euro principal amount. Interest payments on certain “variable rate debt instruments” may be considered qualified stated interest.
If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument will be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument “CPDI”. Thus, if any class of the Rated Notes does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, a U.S. Holder would be required to report income in respect of such Notes in accordance with the CPDI regulations. The CPDI rules are complex and investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the potential taxation of the Notes under the CPDI rules.
Because the OID rules are complex, each U.S. Holder of an OID Note should consult with its own tax advisor regarding the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of such Note.
Interest on the Notes received by a U.S. Holder will generally be treated as foreign source “passive income” for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, or, in certain cases, “general category income”.
(ii) Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Repayment of the Rated Notes

Unless a non-recognition provision applies (and subject to the “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”, “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” and “Disposition of the Subordinated Notes” discussions below which are relevant for holders of any class of Notes treated as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes), a U.S. Holder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale, exchange, repayment or other disposition of a Rated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised plus the fair market value of any property received on the disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note.
The amount realised on the sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note generally is determined by translating the Euro proceeds into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note is disposed of, while a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Rated Note generally will be the cost of the Rated Note to the U.S. Holder, determined by translating the Euro purchase price into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Rated Note was purchased, and increased by the amount of any OID accrued and reduced by any payments other than payments of qualified stated interest of such Note. If, however, the Rated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder or electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date. An election by an accrual basis U.S. Holder to apply the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will be subject to the rules regarding currency translation elections described above, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder will recognise foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Rated Note on the date of acquisition and the date of disposition. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss realised with respect to accrued but unpaid interest is the difference between the U.S. Dollar value of the interest based on the spot exchange rate on the date the Rated Notes are
disposed of and the U.S. Dollar value at which the interest was previously accrued. A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in Euro received on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Rated Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the Euro on the relevant date. Foreign currency gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption or repayment of a Rated Note is recognised only to the extent of total gain or loss on the transaction.
Foreign currency gain or loss recognised by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Rated Note (including repayment at maturity) generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency gain or loss on a Rated Note generally will be treated as capital gain or loss and will generally be from U.S. sources. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder, preferential rates may apply to any capital gain if such U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Rated Notes exceeds one year.
(iii) Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes

As noted above, the Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This summary assumes that the Subordinated Notes will be treated as equity rather than debt for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.
(iv) Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company

A foreign corporation will be classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if 75 per cent. or more of its gross income (including the pro-rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which the Issuer is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) in a taxable year is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign corporation will be classified as a PFIC if at least 50 per cent. of its assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based on fair market value (including the pro-rata share of the assets of any corporation in which the Issuer is considered to own 25 per cent. or more of the shares by value) are held for the production of, or produce, passive income.
Based on the assets that the Issuer expects to hold and the income anticipated thereon, it is highly likely that the Issuer will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the following discussion assumes that the Issuer will be a PFIC throughout the term of the Subordinated Notes, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes should assume that they will be subject to the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below that result from owning shares in a PFIC (subject to the discussion below under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation”).
If the PFIC rules are otherwise applicable, then unless a U.S. Holder elects to treat the Issuer as a “qualified electing fund” (as described in the next paragraph), upon certain distributions (“excess distributions”) by the Issuer and upon a disposition of the Subordinated Notes at a gain, the U.S. Holder will be liable to pay tax at the highest tax rate on ordinary income in effect for each period to which the income is allocated plus interest on the tax, as if such distributions and gain had been recognised rateably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes. An interest charge is also applied to the deferred tax amount resulting from the deemed rateable distribution.
If a U.S. Holder elects to treat the Issuer as a “qualified electing fund” (a “QEF”), distributions and gain will not be taxed as if recognised rateably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period or subject to an interest charge. Instead, a U.S. Holder that makes a QEF election is required for each taxable year to include in income the U.S. Holder’s pro-rata share of the ordinary earnings of the qualified electing fund as ordinary income and a pro-rata share of the net capital gain of the qualified electing fund as capital gain, regardless of whether such earnings or gain have in fact been distributed (assuming the discussion below under “Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” does not apply), and subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes, which deferral is subject to an interest charge. Consequently, in order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive from the Issuer certain information. The Issuer will cause its independent accountants to provide U.S. Holders of the Subordinated Notes, upon request by such U.S. Holder and at the U.S. Holder’s expense, with the information reasonably available to the Issuer that a U.S. Holder would need to make a QEF election. Except as expressly noted, discussion
below assumes that a QEF election will not be made. The cost charged to the U.S. Holder by the Issuer for providing the information may be significant.
As a result of the nature of the Collateral Debt Obligations that the Issuer intends to hold, the Issuer may hold investments treated as equity of non-United States corporations that are PFICs. In such a case, assuming that the Issuer is a PFIC, a U.S. Holder would be treated as owning its pro-rata share of the shares of the PFIC owned by the Issuer. Such a U.S. Holder would be subject to the rules generally applicable to shareholders of PFICs discussed above with respect to distributions received by the Issuer from such a PFIC and dispositions by the Issuer of the shares of such a PFIC (even though the U.S. Holder may not have received the proceeds of such distribution or disposition). Assuming the Issuer receives the necessary information from the PFIC in which it owns shares, certain U.S. Holders may make the QEF election discussed above with respect to the shares of the PFIC owned by the Issuer. However, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to provide U.S. Holders with such information. If the Issuer is a PFIC, generally, each U.S. Holder of a Subordinated Note must make an annual return on IRS Form 8621, with respect to each PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds a direct or indirect interest. If a U.S. Holder does not file Form 8621, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes of such U.S. Holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules.
(v) Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation

Depending on the degree of ownership of the Subordinated Notes and other equity interests in the Issuer by
U.S. Holders and whether the Subordinated Notes are treated as voting securities, the Issuer may constitute a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”). In general, a foreign corporation will constitute a CFC if more than 50 per cent. of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, are owned, directly or indirectly, by “U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholders”. A “U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder”, for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power of all classes of shares of a corporation. It is possible that the IRS may assert that the Subordinated Notes should be treated as voting securities, and consequently that the U.S. Holders owning Subordinated Notes so treated, or any combination of such Subordinated Notes and other voting securities of the Issuer, that constitute 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Issuer are “U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholders” and that, assuming more than 50 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes and other voting securities of the Issuer are held by such U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholders, the Issuer is a CFC.
If the Issuer were treated as a CFC, a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer would be treated, subject to certain exceptions, as receiving a dividend at the end of the taxable year of the Issuer in an amount equal to that person’s pro-rata share of the “subpart F income” and investments in U.S. property of the Issuer. Among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, “subpart F income” includes dividends, interest, annuities, gains from the sale of shares and securities, certain gains from commodities transactions, certain types of insurance income and income from certain transactions with related parties. It is likely that, if the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, predominantly all of its income would be subpart F income. In addition, special rules apply to determine the appropriate exchange rate to be used to translate such amounts treated as a dividend and the amount of any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to distributions of previously taxed amounts attributable to movements in exchange rates between the times of deemed and actual distributions and certain “dividends” from such CFC could be recharacterised as U.S. source income for
U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion below assumes that the Issuer is not a CFC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding these special rules.
If the Issuer were to constitute a CFC, for the period during which a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes is a
U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer, such Holder generally would be taxable on the subpart F income and investments in U.S. property of the Issuer under rules described in the preceding paragraph and not under the PFIC rules previously described. A U.S. Holder that is a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder of the Issuer subject to the CFC rules for only a portion of the time during which it holds Subordinated Notes should consult its own tax advisor regarding the interaction of the PFIC and CFC rules.
(vi) Distributions on the Subordinated Notes

Except to the extent that distributions are attributable to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules or a QEF election is made, some or all of any distributions with respect to the Subordinated Notes may constitute excess distributions, taxable as previously described. Distributions of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer which are not excess distributions will be taxed as dividends when received. The amount of such income is determined by translating Euros received into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder may realise foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the Euros received.
(vii) Eligibility for Reduced Rate of Taxation on Dividends

It is not expected that distributions received on the Subordinated Notes will be eligible for taxation at the lower rates applicable to long-term capital gains that are available on certain dividends paid to non- corporate U.S. Holders of shares of U.S. corporations and certain non-U.S. corporations.
(viii) Disposition of the Subordinated Notes

In general, a U.S. Holder of a Subordinated Note will recognise gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of the Subordinated Note equal to the difference between the amount realised and such Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Subordinated Note. Initially, the tax basis of a U.S. Holder should equal the amount paid for a Subordinated Note. Such basis will be increased by amounts taxable to such Holder by virtue of the QEF or CFC rules (if applicable), and decreased by actual distributions from the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a non-taxable return of capital. A U.S. Holder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes generally will realise an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale. A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. Dollar amount realised. Any gain or loss realised by a U.S. Holder on a subsequent conversion of the foreign currency for a different amount will be foreign currency gain or loss. If, however, the Subordinated Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder or electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the amount realised on the settlement date.
Unless a QEF election is made, it is highly likely that any gain realised on the sale or exchange of a Subordinated Note will be treated as an excess distribution and taxed as ordinary income under the special tax rules described above (assuming that the PFIC rules apply and not the CFC rules).
Subject to a special limitation for individual U.S. Holders that have held the Subordinated Notes for more than one year, if the Issuer were treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder were treated as a U.S. 10 per cent. Shareholder therein, then any gain realised by such Holder upon the disposition of Subordinated Notes would be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro-rata share of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Issuer and any of its subsidiaries. In this respect, earnings and profits would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules.
(ix) Foreign Currency Gain or Loss

A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or other Notes treated as equity interests in the Issuer) that recognises income from the Notes under the QEF or CFC rules discussed above will recognise foreign currency gain or loss attributable to movement in foreign exchange rates between the date when it recognised income under those rules and the date when the income actually is distributed. Any such foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss from the same source as the associated income inclusion.
A U.S. Holder that purchases Notes with previously owned foreign currency generally will recognise foreign currency gain or loss in an amount equal to any difference between the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency at the spot rate on the date the Notes
are purchased. A U.S. Holder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or other disposition of the Notes generally will realise an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale. A
U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. dollar amount realised. Any gain or loss realised by a U.S. Holder on a subsequent conversion of the foreign currency for a different amount will be foreign currency gain or loss.
(x) Transfer and Other Reporting Requirements

In general, U.S. Holders who acquire any Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that is recharacterised as equity in the Issuer) for cash may be required to file a Form 926 with the IRS and to supply certain additional information to the IRS if (i) such U.S. Holder owns (directly or indirectly) immediately after the transfer, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the transfer when aggregated with all related transfers under applicable regulations, exceeds $100,000. If a U.S. Holder that is required to file fails to file such form, that U.S. Holder could be subject to a penalty of up to $100,000 (computed as 10 per cent. of the gross amount paid for the Subordinated Notes) or more if the failure to file was due to intentional disregard of its obligation.
In addition, a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes that owns (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer (and each officer or director of the Issuer that is a U.S. citizen or resident) may be required to file an information return on IRS Form 5471. A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes generally is required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if it owns (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding whether they are required to file IRS Form 5471. If a U.S. Holder that is required to file such form fails to file such form, the U.S. Holder could be subject to a penalty of
$10,000 for each such failure to file (in addition to other consequences).
Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes or any other Class of Notes should consult with their own tax advisors regarding whether they are required to file IRS Form 8886 in respect of this transaction. Such filing generally will be required if such investors file U.S. federal income tax returns or U.S. federal information returns and recognise losses in excess of a specified threshold, and significant penalties may be imposed on taxpayers that fail to file the form timely. Such filing will also generally be required by a U.S. Holder of the Subordinated Notes if the Issuer both participates in certain types of transactions that are treated as “reportable transactions,” such as a transaction in which its loss exceeds a specified threshold, and either (x) such U.S. Holder owns 10 per cent. or more of the aggregate amount of the Subordinated Notes and makes a QEF Election with respect to the Issuer or (y) the Issuer is treated as a CFC and such
U.S. Holder is a “U.S. Shareholder” (as defined above) of the Issuer. If the Issuer does participate in a reportable transaction, it will make reasonable efforts to make such information available. Significant penalties may be imposed on taxpayers required to file Form 8886 that fail to do so timely.
A U.S. Holder that is an individual and holds certain foreign financial assets must file new IRS Form 8938 to report the ownership of such assets if the total value of those assets exceeds the applicable threshold amounts. The threshold varies depending on whether the individual lives in the United States or files a joint income tax return with a spouse. For example, an unmarried U.S. Holder living in the United States is required to file Form 8938 if the total value of all specified foreign financial assets is more than $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year. U.S. Holders in other situations have the same or greater thresholds. In general, specified foreign financial assets include debt or equity interests (that are not regularly traded on an established securities market) issued by foreign financial institutions (such as the Issuer), and any interest in a foreign entity that is not a financial institution, including any shares or security, and any financial instrument or contract held for investment that has an issuer or counterparty that is not a U.S. person. Proposed regulations also would require certain domestic entities that are formed, or availed of, for purposes of holding, directly or indirectly, specified foreign financial assets to file IRS Form 8938. In addition, certain non-resident alien individuals may be required to file Form 8938, notwithstanding the availability of any special treatment under an income tax treaty. However, in general, such form is not required to be filed with respect to the Notes if they are held through a U.S. payer, such as a U.S. financial institution, a U.S. branch of a non-U.S. bank, and certain non-U.S. branches or subsidiaries of U.S. financial institutions.
Taxpayers who fail to make the required disclosure with respect to any taxable year are subject to a penalty of $10,000 for such taxable year, which may be increased up to $50,000 for a continuing failure to file the form after being notified by the IRS. In addition, the failure to file Form 8938 will extend the statute of limitations for a taxpayer’s entire related income tax return (and not just the portion of the return that relates to the omission) until at least three years after the date on which the Form 8938 is filed.
All U.S. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to whether a Note is a foreign financial asset that (if the applicable threshold were met) would be subject to this rule.
(f) Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax

The amount of interest and principal paid or accrued on the Notes, and the proceeds from the sale of a Note, in each case, paid within the United States or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman to a U.S. person (other than a corporation or other exempt recipient) will be reported to the IRS. Under the Code, a U.S. person may be subject, under certain circumstances, to “backup withholding tax” with respect to interest and principal on a Note or the gross proceeds from the sale of a Note paid within the United States or by a U.S. middleman or United States payor to a U.S. Person. Backup withholding tax generally applies only if the
U.S. person: (a) fails to furnish its social security or other taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after the request therefore; (b) furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (c) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report interest OID or dividends; or (d) fails, under certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding tax for failure to report interest and dividend payments.
Non-U.S. persons or, in certain cases, their beneficial owners may be required to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. Holders in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding tax.
(g) Non-U.S. Holders

Subject to the discussions below under “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax” and “Application of New Tax Reporting and Withholding Law”, payments, including interest, OID and any amounts treated as dividends, on a Note to a non-U.S. Holder and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note by a non-U.S. Holder, will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless: (a) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or (b) in the case of federal income tax imposed on gain, such non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds a Note as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.
(h) Net Investment Tax

U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates, and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax (the “3.8 per cent. Net Investment Tax”) on all or a portion of their “net investment income” which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes. A U.S. individual that is a beneficiary of a non-U.S. Holder which is an estate or trust generally will be subject to the 3.8 per cent. Net Investment Tax with respect to distributions of net investment from such estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. Net Investment Tax will be imposed on the lesser of: (i) net investment income (undistributed net investment income for estates and trusts); and (ii) the excess of modified adjusted gross income (adjusted gross income for estates and trusts) and the applicable threshold amount. Equity holders of PFICs and CFCs are subject to such tax, although the application of the tax is quite complex. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the consequences (and advisability of available elections) with respect to the 3.8 per cent. Net Investment Tax.
(i) FATCA

It is possible that (a) sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code or any associated regulations or other official guidance; (b) any treaty, law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction, or relating to an intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and any other jurisdiction, which (in either case) facilitates the implementation of paragraph (a); or (c) any agreement pursuant to the implementation of paragraphs (a) or (b) above with the IRS, the U.S. government or any governmental or taxation authority in any other jurisdiction (“FATCA”), could compel the Issuer to subject the Notes held by some Noteholders to a forced sale. It is also possible that FATCA could impose a withholding tax of up to 30 per cent. on payments, including principal, made to Recalcitrant Noteholders and Non-participating FFIs (each defined below), depending on the particular circumstances of the Issuer, the Notes, and the Noteholders and beneficial owners thereof. Further, there could also be, as of 1 July 2014, withholding of up to 30 per cent. on certain payments to the Issuer.
This withholding tax (which may not be refundable) does not apply to certain U.S. source obligations that are outstanding as of 30 June 2014 and certain non-U.S. source obligations that are outstanding on the later of 30 June 2014 and the date that is six months after the adoption of final U.S. Treasury regulations addressing withholding on “foreign passthru payments” and, in each case, that are not modified and treated as reissued, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, after the relevant date (collectively, Grandfathered Obligations) or if the Issuer enters into its own IRS Agreement. There is no assurance that the Issuer will enter into such an agreement. This withholding tax will also not apply to the Issuer if it is resident in a jurisdiction that enters into an agreement with the U.S. (a “Partner Country Agreement”) in which such jurisdiction (a “Partner Country”) agrees to (and subsequently does) enact legislation in furtherance of FATCA. If the Issuer is resident in a Partner Country, it will then be subject to modified FATCA requirements, as discussed. As the Issuer is incorporated in The Netherlands, one of the jurisdictions which has indicated that it intends to enter into a Partner Country Agreement, it is anticipated that it will be subject to the future FATCA-related laws of The Netherlands. As those laws have not yet even been drafted, it is unclear whether the Issuer will comply (or be compelled to comply) with such laws. If The Netherlands does not enact such FATCA-related laws or, if enacted, that the Issuer fails to comply with such laws, the Issuer will be required to enter into an IRS Agreement in order to avoid the new withholding taxes described above.
FATCA is particularly complex, and is dependent on the particular factual circumstances of the Issuer, the Notes and the Noteholders. Broadly, however, FATCA (including any analogous non-U.S. laws enacted in furtherance of FATCA) will require the Issuer or an authorised agent acting on behalf of the Issuer (and any agent or broker through which a Noteholder purchases its Notes, or any nominee or other entity through which a Noteholder holds its Notes (any such agent, broker, nominee or other entity, an “Intermediary”)) to provide certain information to a tax authority about the Noteholders.
If necessary, the Issuer intends to enter into an IRS Agreement and the Issuer expects to require (and that an Intermediary will require) the Noteholder to provide certifications and identifying information about itself and its owners (or beneficial owners) in order to enable the Issuer (or an Intermediary) to identify and report on the Noteholder and certain of the Noteholder’s direct and indirect U.S. beneficial owners. Further, the Noteholder will be required to permit the Issuer to share such information with any tax authority. Although certain exceptions to these disclosure requirements could apply, each Noteholder should assume that the failure to provide the required information generally will compel the Issuer (or an Intermediary) to force the sale of the Noteholder’s Notes (and such sale could be for less than its then fair market value).
In addition, subject to exceptions, if the Noteholder is a “foreign financial institution” or “FFI” as defined under FATCA that does not enter into an IRS Agreement (such an FFI, a “Non-participating FFI”) or if a Noteholder does not comply with the Issuer’s request for information or a waiver of law prohibiting the disclosure of such information to a tax authority, (such a Noteholder, a “Recalcitrant Noteholder”) the Issuer may be required to withhold up to 30 per cent. on certain payments made to the Noteholder.
If any withholding is imposed pursuant to FATCA on payments to a Recalcitrant Noteholder or a Non- participating FFI, the Issuer is under no obligation to gross up such payments.
Further, the Issuer could be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax if it fails to enter into an (or is in violation of its) IRS Agreement. If the Issuer is unable to enter into an IRS Agreement (or the agreement is voided for non-compliance), such decision could preclude certain of its FFI affiliates from entering into such an agreement. In addition, if an FFI affiliate of the Issuer is not FATCA compliant (i.e., it fails to comply with, and is not exempted from complying with, FATCA), the Issuer itself may be prohibited from complying with FATCA. For this purpose an FFI affiliate generally is an FFI that is deemed to be part of an affiliated group that includes the Issuer (where, in general, such affiliates and the Issuer are deemed related through more than 50 per cent. ownership). For example, if an FFI owns (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer’s equity and such FFI equity owner is not FATCA compliant, the Issuer may be prevented from complying with FATCA. Furthermore, if an entity is deemed (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to own more than 50 per cent. of the equity of both (i) the Issuer and (ii) another FFI, such other FFI may be treated as an FFI affiliate of the Issuer for this purpose and, thus, if such other FFI is not FATCA compliant, the Issuer may be prevented from complying with FATCA. Although the Issuer will not prohibit any person from holding more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer’s equity, it may force the sale of all or a portion of the equity held by such a person if such holder is an FFI affiliate of the Issuer that is preventing the Issuer from complying with FATCA. For these purposes, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.
If a non-U.S. law prohibits the Noteholder from providing the information requested by the Issuer (or the Issuer from providing such information to the IRS) as described above, the Noteholder generally must execute a waiver of this non-U.S. law (and then provide (or permit the Issuer to provide) such information) or dispose of the Notes (or otherwise have the Issuer cause the disposal of the Notes) within a reasonable period of time. In addition, in complying with the reporting requirements under FATCA, it may, as described above, be necessary for the Issuer to agree in the IRS Agreement to “close out” any Noteholder (and not just a Noteholder that fails to obtain the foreign law waiver described above) that fails to respond to its reasonable requests for information that will enable the Issuer to comply with such U.S. reporting requirements. If the Issuer does “close out” any Noteholder’s interest, it may do so by causing the sale of such Notes.
The full extent of FATCA’s application to the Issuer (or an Intermediary) is currently uncertain. No assurance can be given that the Issuer (or an Intermediary) will be able to take all necessary actions or that actions taken will be successful to minimize the impact of FATCA. Further, the efficacy of the Issuer’s (or an Intermediary’s) actions might not be within the control of the Issuer (or an Intermediary) and, for example, may depend on the actions of the Noteholder (and each foreign withholding agent (if any) in the chain of custody). Each potential purchaser of Notes should consult its own tax advisor about how FATCA might affect such prospective Noteholder in its particular circumstance.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR SHAREHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISER ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.
4. EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income

Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), each member state is required to provide to the tax authorities of another member state details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in that other member state; however for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments. The end of this transitional period depends on the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to exchange of information with certain other countries.
A number of non EU countries, including Switzerland, (“Third Countries”) and certain dependent or associated territories of certain member states (“Dependent and Associated Territories”) have adopted
similar measures in relation to payments of interest or other similar income paid by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in another member state, or certain Third Countries or Dependent and Associated Territories.
The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the EU Savings Directive which may, if implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above. Further developments in this respect should be monitored on a continuing basis, since no certainty exists over whether and when the proposed amendments to the EU Savings Directive will be implemented. Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” subject thereto including entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification investments being made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.
Section 406 of ERISA and section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.
Governmental plans, certain church plans and certain non-U.S. plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under Federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. section 2510.3 101, the “Plan Asset Regulation”), as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA, if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or (b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Investment Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.
If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated
Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Class E Notes, Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or a Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined in accordance with Section 3(42) of ERISA, the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation. No Subordinated Note will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors.
Even if the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes would not be treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.
Each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager, or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and/or section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Investment Manager or their respective affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies).
It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. section 2550.401c 1.
Each purchaser and transferee of a Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note or Class D Note or any interest in such Note will be required or deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) either (A) it is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law that is similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of section 406 of ERISA and/or section 4975 of the Code (“Other Plan Law”), and no part of the assets to be used by it to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or such governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, or (B) its acquisition, holding or disposition of such Notes (or interests therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other Plan, a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law, and (ii) it
will not sell or transfer such Notes (or interests therein) to a transferee acquiring such Notes (or interests therein) unless the transferee makes the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements described in clause (i) hereof.
If you are a purchaser (other than the Initial Purchaser) or transferee (other than a transferee of the Retention Notes) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate you will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person unless you receive the written consent of the Issuer, provide an ERISA certificate to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to your status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and hold such Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate; and (ii) (A) if you are a Controlling Person or you are, or are acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, your acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (B) if you are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (1) you are not, and for so long as you hold such Notes or interest therein will not be, subject to any federal, state, local non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or any interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Investment Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to Other Plan Law (“Similar Law”) and (2) your acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law and (3) you will agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding your interest in such Notes. In respect of a proposed transfer of the Retention Notes, the transferee must (i) have received the written consent of the Issuer; (ii) provide an ERISA certificate in or substantially in the form set out at Annex B (Form of ERISA Certificate) hereto and as set out in the Trust Deed to the Issuer and a Transfer Agent as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person; and (iii) hold such Notes in the form of Definitive Certificates. In addition, the proposed transferee of the Retention Notes must represent and agree that (i) if it is a Controlling Person or if it is, or is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (B) if it is a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (1) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Notes or interest therein will not be, subject to any federal, state, local non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or any interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Investment Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to any Similar Law and (2) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law and (3) it will agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Notes.

The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by such plans in general or any particular plan, or that this investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan.

Listing

Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on its Global Exchange Market. There can be no assurance that any such approval will be granted or, if granted that such listing will be maintained. It is expected that the total expenses related to admission to trading will be approximately €6,440.
Consents and Authorisations

The Issuer has obtained all necessary consents, approvals and authorisations in The Netherlands (if any) in connection with the issue and performance of the Notes. The issue of the Notes was authorised by resolutions of the board of Managing Directors of the Issuer passed on 20 February 2014.
No Significant or Material Change

There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 26 September 2013 and there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or prospects of the Issuer since its incorporation on 26 September 2013.
No Litigation

The Issuer is not involved, and has not been involved, in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer is aware) which may have or have had since the date of its incorporation a significant effect on the Issuer’s financial position.
Accounts

Since the date of its incorporation, other than entering into certain documentation, without any net assets or liabilities for the Issuer relating to a transaction which did not proceed, the Issuer has not commenced operations other than (if applicable) in respect of any warehouse agreements, any asset/forward sale or purchase agreements or trade confirmations which may be entered into in respect of the acquisition of (or commitment to acquire) certain assets to be comprised in the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and has not produced accounts.
So long as any Note remains outstanding, copies of the most recent annual audited financial statements of the Issuer can be obtained at the specified offices of the Issuer during normal business hours. The first financial statements of the Issuer will be in respect of the period from incorporation to 30 June 2015. The annual accounts of the Issuer will be audited. The Issuer will not prepare interim financial statements.
The Trust Deed requires the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee on an annual basis and otherwise promptly on request that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) or other matter which is required to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
Documents Available

Copies of the following documents may be inspected in electronic format (and, in the case of each of (f) and (h) below, will be available for collection free of charge) at the registered offices of Issuer during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for the term of the Notes:

Enforceability of Judgments

The Issuer is a private company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands. None of the Managing Directors are residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United States courts judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States.

ANNEX B
FORM OF ERISA CERTIFICATE

The purpose of this ERISA Certificate (this “Certificate”) is, among other things, to (i) endeavour to ensure that less than 25 per cent. of the value of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] (determined separately by class) issued by Jubilee CLO 2014-XI B.V. (the “Issuer”) is held by (a) an employee benefit plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (b) a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) or (c) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity (collectively, “Benefit Plan Investors”), (ii) obtain from you certain representations and agreements and (iii) provide you with certain related information with respect to your acquisition, holding or disposition of [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes]. By signing this Certificate, you agree to be bound by its terms.
Please be aware that the information contained in this Certificate is not intended to constitute advice and the examples given below are not intended to be, and are not, comprehensive. You should contact your own counsel if you have any questions in completing this Certificate.

Examples: (i) tax qualified retirement plans such as pension, profit sharing and section 401(k) plans, (ii) welfare benefit plans such as accident, life and medical plans, (iii) individual retirement accounts or “IRAs” and “Keogh” plans and (iv) certain tax-qualified educational and savings trusts.
2. □ Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in such entity.
Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and (iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.
If you check Box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code: per cent..
An entity or fund that cannot provide the foregoing percentage hereby acknowledges that for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors own less than 25 per cent. of the value of [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes], 100 per cent. of the assets of the entity or fund will be treated as “plan assets.”
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section 2, you should consult with your counsel.
3. □ Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company’s corporate investment portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”).
If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute “plan assets” under Section 401(a) of ERISA for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent.

4. □ None of Sections (1) Through (3) Above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections (1) to (3) above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections (1) to (3) above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer of such change.
5. No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) to (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] do not and will not constitute or give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
6. Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer and the Investment Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to laws or regulations that are similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] do not and will not constitute or give rise to a non-exempt violation of any law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
7. □ Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Investment Manager, (ii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (iv) any “affiliate” of any of the above persons. “Affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a “Controlling Person.”
Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the value of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes], the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.
Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:
(i) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer shall, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder within fourteen calendar days after the date of such notice;
(ii) if we fail to transfer our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes], the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] or our interest in the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Holder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;
(iii) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the [Class E Notes] [Class F
Notes] [Subordinated Notes] and selling such securities to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;
(iv) by our acceptance of an interest in the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes], we agree to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers;
(v) the proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to us; and
(vi) the terms and conditions of any sale under this sub-section shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to us as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
8. Continuing Representation; Reliance. We acknowledge and agree that the representations contained in this Certificate shall be deemed made on each day from the date we make such representations through and including the date on which we dispose of our interests in the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes]. We understand and agree that the information supplied in this Certificate will be used and relied upon by the Issuer to determine that Benefit Plan Investors own or hold less than 25 per cent. of the value of the Class E Notes upon any subsequent transfer of the [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] in accordance with the Trust Deed.
9. Further Acknowledgement and Agreement. We acknowledge and agree that (i) all of the assurances contained in this Certificate are for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee, Merrill Lynch International and the Investment Manager as third party beneficiaries hereof, (ii) copies of this Certificate and any information contained herein may be provided to the Issuer, the Trustee, Merrill Lynch International, the Investment Manager, affiliates of any of the foregoing parties and to each of the foregoing parties’ respective counsel for purposes of making the determinations described above and (iii) any acquisition or transfer of [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] by us that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate shall be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.
10. Future Transfer Requirements.
Transferee Letter and its Delivery. We acknowledge and agree that we may not transfer any [Class E Notes] [Class F Notes] [Subordinated Notes] to any person unless the Issuer has received a certificate substantially in the form of this Certificate. Any attempt to transfer in violation of this section will be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.

ANNEX C MOODY’S RECOVERY RATES

The “Moody’s Recovery Rate” is, with respect to any Collateral Debt Obligation, as of any Measurement Date, the recovery rate determined in accordance with the following, in the following order of priority:
(a) if the Collateral Debt Obligation has been specifically assigned a recovery rate by Moody’s (for example, in connection with the assignment by Moody’s of an estimated rating), such recovery rate;
(b) if the preceding clause does not apply to the Collateral Debt Obligation, except with respect to Corporate Rescue Loan, the rate determined pursuant to the table below based on the number of rating sub-categories difference between the Collateral Debt Obligation’s Moody’s Rating and its Moody’s Default Probability Rating (for purposes of clarification, if the Moody’s Rating is higher than the Moody’s Default Probability Rating, the rating sub-categories difference will be positive and if it is lower, negative):
Number of Moody’s Ratings Sub-categories Difference Between the Moody’s Rating and the Moody’s Default
‎

Moody’s Secured Senior Loans
‎
Secured Senior Bonds; Second Lien Loans; Mezzanine Obligations*
‎
All other Collateral Debt Obligations








(c) if the Collateral Debt Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan (other than a Corporate Rescue Loan which has been specifically assigned a recovery rate by Moody’s), 50 per cent.
* If such Collateral Debt Obligation is publicly rated by Moody’s and does not have both a CFR and an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Collateral Debt Obligation will be deemed to be an Unsecured Senior Obligation or High- Yield Bond for purposes of this table.

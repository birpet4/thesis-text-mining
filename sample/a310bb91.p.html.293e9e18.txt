This Offering Circular does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of Article 6 of Regulation 2017/1129/EU (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). The Issuer is not offering the Refinancing Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances that would require a prospectus to be prepared pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange p.l.c. trading as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”) for the Refinancing Notes to be admitted to the Official List (the “Official List”) and for the Refinancing Notes and the Subordinated Notes to be admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin (the “Global Exchange Market”). It is anticipated that listing will take place on or about the Issue Date. There can be no assurance that such listing will be maintained. This Offering Circular constitutes listing particulars for the purpose of such application and has been approved by Euronext Dublin. The Subordinated Notes are currently admitted to the Official List and trading on the regulated market of Euronext Dublin (the “Regulated Market”). It is anticipated that the Subordinated Notes will be simultaneously de-listed from the Regulated Market and listed on the Global Exchange Market on or around the Issue Date.
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer which are payable solely out of amounts received by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Collateral (as defined herein). The net proceeds of the realisation of the security over the Collateral upon acceleration of the Notes following a Note Event of Default (as defined herein) may be insufficient to pay all amounts due on the Notes after making payments to other creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority thereto or pari passu therewith. In the event of a shortfall in such proceeds, the Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets (including amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Dutch Account and the rights of the Issuer under the Issuer Management Agreement (each as defined herein)) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall, all claims in respect of such shortfall will be extinguished. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition).

The Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and will be offered only: (a) outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons (in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”)); and (b) within the United States to persons and outside the United States to U.S. Persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S (“U.S. Persons”)), in each case, who are both qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) in reliance on Rule 144A and qualified purchasers for the purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). The Issuer will not be registered under the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Refinancing Notes are not intended to be sold and should not be sold to retail investors. For these purposes, a retail investor means (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) a person who is not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

EU RETENTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
Each prospective investor in the Refinancing Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction are sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Sole Arranger. the Initial
Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such Person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Refinancing Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting and other advisors and/or its regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of which it is uncertain. See “Risk Factors - Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements –Transparency Requirements”, and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” below.
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, the Issuer intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(l) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”) and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available (or procure that such information is made available) via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager and as further notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies (substantially in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form which may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator from time to time) (which certificate may be given electronically and upon which certificate the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is a competent authority, a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes (and in such other manner as required by any competent authority (as instructed to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator)). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.
For the avoidance of doubt, and following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for the use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
In connection with such information and reporting, the Collateral Manager will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders, and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
U.S. RISK RETENTION RULES
The U.S. Risk Retention Rules require the “sponsor” of a “securitization transaction” to retain (either directly or through its “majority-owned affiliates”) not less than 5 per cent. of the “credit risk” of “securitized assets” (as such terms are defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules prohibit the “sponsor” or its “majority-owned affiliates”, as applicable, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the “credit risk” during the period of time that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules require that the risk be retained.
Based on the LSTA Decision and the Mandate (as defined below), each prospective investor should be aware that no party involved in the transaction will obtain on the Issue Date and retain any Notes intended to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger. the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Refinancing Notes and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes or any other person with respect to the application of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to the Issuer, or to such investor’s investment in the Refinancing Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.
VOLCKER RULE
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the “Volcker Rule”) relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.
An “ownership interest” is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.
The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.
The Issuer may be deemed to be a “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. “banking entities” and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.
It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.
The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. The holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.
There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Refinancing Notes. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Refinancing Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally.
Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Refinancing Notes, now or at any time in the future. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives
– Volcker Rule” below for further information.
Information as to placement within the United States
The Refinancing Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). Rule 144A Notes of each Class will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”), or, in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Refinancing Notes of each Class sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes”) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (“U.S. Residents”) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate. Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Notes in definitive certificated form will be issued only in limited circumstances. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may, in certain circumstances described herein, be issued in definitive, certificated, fully registered form, pursuant to the Trust Deed and will be offered outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S and within the United States to persons who are QIB/QPs in reliance on Rule 144A and, in each case, will be registered in the name of the holder (or a nominee thereof). In each case, purchasers and transferees of notes will be deemed and in certain circumstances will be required to have made certain representations and agreements. See “Form of the Refinancing Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”, “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act. Each purchaser of an interest in the Refinancing Notes (other than a non-U.S. Person outside the U.S.) will be deemed to have represented and agreed that it is a QIB and a QP and will also be deemed to have made the representations set out in “Transfer Restrictions” herein.

Commodity Pool Regulation
BASED UPON INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDED FROM A DIVISION OF THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”), THE ISSUER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY POOL AND AS SUCH, THE ISSUER (OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER ON THE ISSUER’S BEHALF) MAY ENTER INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF “SWAP” AS SET OUT IN THE CEA (AS DEFINED BELOW)) FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF LEGAL ADVICE FROM REPUTABLE COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS EITHER A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND CFTC REGULATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER. IN THE EVENT THAT TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL”, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EITHER SEEK TO UTILIZE ANY AVAILABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) OR REGISTER AS A CPO. UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO/CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.

MIFID II Product Governance
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Refinancing Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Refinancing Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Refinancing Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Refinancing Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Refinancing Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.
Notwithstanding the reference to “professional client” the only client of the Collateral Manager is the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will not provide any investment services to any Noteholder or advise on the merits of, or make any recommendation in relation to, the terms of any transaction. No representative of the Collateral Manager is authorised to behave in anyway which would lead Noteholders or any other person to believe otherwise. The Noteholders are not therefore “clients” of the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Manager is not responsible for providing Noteholders or any party other than the Issuer with the protections afforded to its clients. Such persons should seek their own independent legal, investment and tax advice as they see fit.
PRIIPs Regulation and Prohibition of Sales to EEA retail investors
The Refinancing Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation 2017/1129/EU (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Refinancing Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Refinancing Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.
Notwithstanding the reference to “retail client” the only client of the Collateral Manager is the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will not provide any investment services to any Noteholders or advise on the merits of, or make any recommendation in relation to, the terms of any transaction. No representative of the Collateral Manager is authorised to behave in anyway which would lead Noteholders or any other person to believe otherwise. Noteholders are not therefore “clients” of the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Manager is not responsible for providing Noteholders or any party other than the Issuer with the protections afforded to its clients. Such persons should seek their own independent legal, investment and tax advice as they see fit.
Benchmarks Regulation
Amounts payable under the Rated Notes are calculated by reference to EURIBOR. As at the date of this Offering Circular, the administrator of EURIBOR (being the European Money Markets Institute) is included in ESMA’s register of administrators and benchmarks established and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority pursuant to article 36 of Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011.

1 Applicable to each three month Accrual Period, provided that the rate of interest of the Rated Notes will be determined for the period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the first Payment Date, by reference to a straight line interpolation of one month EURIBOR and three month EURIBOR.
2 Applicable at all times following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, provided that the rate of interest of the Notes of each Class for the period from, and including, the final Payment Date before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date will, if such first mentioned Payment Date falls in January 2032, be determined by reference to three month EURIBOR.
3 Any Class of Notes may be issued with a fixed rate, a floating rate or a combination of both.
4 The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency. As of the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union (“EU”) and is registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (as amended) (the “CRA Regulation”). As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation.
5 Each of the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be negotiated at the time of sale which may vary among different purchasers and which may be different to the issue price of the Notes.
6 The Subordinated Notes are not being offered pursuant to this Offering Circular. The Subordinated Notes are currently admitted to the Official List and trading on the regulated market of Euronext Dublin and will be de-listed on the Issue Date and listed and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market on such date.
Eligible PurchasersThe Refinancing Notes of each Class will be offered:
(a) to non-U.S. Persons in “offshore transactions” in reliance on Regulation S; and
(b) to U.S. Persons, in each case, who are QIB/QPs in reliance on Rule 144A.
Distributions on the Notes

(b) 17 January, 17 April, 17 July and 17 October, at all other times,

Interest in respect of the Notes of each Class will be payable semi- annually in arrear in respect of each six month Accrual Period and quarterly in arrear in respect of each three month Accrual Period, in each case on each Payment Date (with the first Payment Date occurring in January 2020) in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments.
Stated Interest RateInterest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes on each Payment Date to the extent funds are available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Non Payment and Deferral of InterestFailure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts due
and payable on the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment shall not be a Note Event of Default unless and until such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days (or
seven Business Days in the case of an error or omission), and save in each case as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of any withholding tax thereon as set out in Condition 9 (Taxation).
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment will not constitute a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class C Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption in full of the Class D Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and following redemption if full of the Class E Notes failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class F Notes when the same becomes due and payable.
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes are not made on the relevant Payment Date, an amount equal to such unpaid interest will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes (as applicable), and from the date such unpaid interest is added to the applicable Principal Amount Outstanding of the relevant Class of Notes, such unpaid amount will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to the relevant Class of Notes. See Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest).
Non-payment of amounts due and payable on the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds will not constitute a Note Event of Default.

circumstances:
(a) on the Maturity Date (see Condition 7(a) (Final Redemption));
(b) on any Payment Date following a Determination Date on which a Coverage Test is not satisfied (to the extent such test is required to be satisfied on such Determination Date) (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests));

(f) on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period to cure a failure of the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, at the option of the Collateral Manager (see Condition 7(k) (Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test));

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Refinancing Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Refinancing Notes and the related arrangements. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Refinancing Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.

The Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder and their respective Affiliates (i) did not participate in the preparation of the latest Payment Date Report and the latest Monthly Report or any financial statements of the Issuer, (ii) are relying on representations from the Issuer as to the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the latest Payment Date Report and the latest Monthly Report and (iii) shall have no responsibility whatsoever for the contents of the latest Payment Date Report and the latest Monthly Report or any financial statements of the Issuer.

1. GENERAL
1.1 General
The Issuer has invested, and will continue to invest, in loans, bonds and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Refinancing Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Refinancing Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Refinancing Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Refinancing Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Refinancing Notes in the Priority of Payments. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular, payments in respect of the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes. None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or the Collateral Administrator undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Refinancing Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.
In preparing and furnishing the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports, the Issuer will rely conclusively on the accuracy and completeness of the information or data regarding the Collateral Obligations that has been provided to it by the Collateral Administrator (who will rely, in turn, on the accuracy and completeness of certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager and third parties) and the Issuer will not verify, re-compute, reconcile or recalculate any such information or data.
In addition, the information contained in the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports is dependent in part on interpretations, calculations and/or determinations made by the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator. The accuracy of the Payment Date Reports and the Monthly Reports, and the information included therein, is therefore subject to the accuracy of the interpretations, calculations and/or determinations of the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator.
While the latest Payment Date Report and the latest Monthly Report (as defined herein) with respect to the underlying assets are included as Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto respectively, and are expressly incorporated into this Offering Circular, such information has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by any accounting firm, independent accountants or any other third party, either in connection with the offering of the Refinancing Notes or otherwise. None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee is responsible to investors for, and makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the latest Monthly Report or the latest Payment Date Report incorporated herein.
Such information is limited and does not provide a full description of all Collateral Obligations previously held or sold by the Issuer, nor the gains or losses associated with purchases or sales of Collateral Obligations, nor the levels of compliance with the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests during periods prior to the periods covered by the reports contained in Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto. Such reports contain information as of the dates specified therein and were not calculated as of the date of this Offering Circular or on or after the Issue Date. As such, the information in the report may no longer reflect the characteristics of the Collateral Obligations as of the date of this Offering Circular or on or after the Issue Date.
The composition of the Collateral Obligations will change over time as a result of: (i) scheduled and unscheduled principal payments on the Collateral Obligations; (ii) sales of Collateral Obligations and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds and other Principal Proceeds; and (iii) other factors, subject to the limitations described in the Conditions and the Transaction Documents.
No information is provided in this Offering Circular regarding the Issuer’s investment performance and the Portfolio except as set forth in Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto and no information is provided in this Offering Circular regarding any other aspect of the Issuer’s operations. While the Issuer believes no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no assurance can be given that the Issuer has unintentionally failed to comply with one or more of its obligations under the Transaction Documents, nor that any such failure will not have a material adverse effect on Noteholders in the future.
1.2 Prior Activities of the Issuer
The Issuer was incorporated on 10 June 2016. On 15 December 2016, the Issuer issued the Original Notes secured by various assets owned by the Issuer.
The only operations that an issuer of structured rated notes similar to the Refinancing Notes is ordinarily permitted to perform prior to the issue date thereof is the entry into the warehouse arrangements in respect of the acquisition of certain assets on which such notes are to be secured on or prior to such issue date. This is to mitigate the risk that creditors of the issuer may exist as a result of the activities of such issuer who may be able to take action against the issuer should it not perform its obligations to the extent that such creditors have not entered into limited recourse and non-petition provisions similar to those to which the Secured Parties are subject pursuant to the Trust Deed. This risk is potentially increased in the case of the Issuer, as a result of it having issued the Refinancing Notes.
In order to mitigate this increased risk, all Classes of the Notes will, on the Issue Date, be subject to the same Conditions and Transaction Documents and the secured parties under the Original Notes will be party to such Transaction Documents.
1.3 Suitability
Prospective purchasers of the Refinancing Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Refinancing Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Refinancing Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Refinancing Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.
1.4 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer
The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.
1.5 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s
Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Refinancing Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and
the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.
1.6 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets
Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.
As discussed further in “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.
Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of adverse economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Refinancing Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Refinancing Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. In addition, the primary market for a number of financial products including leveraged loans has not fully recovered from the effects of the global credit crisis. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors.
Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.
The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Refinancing Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Subordinated Notes.
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirements for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial distress of another financial institution may result in the
disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Refinancing Notes.
The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Refinancing Notes as well as the Collateral.
While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.
1.7 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders
In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high- yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Refinancing Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Refinancing Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Refinancing Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.
1.8 European Union and Euro Zone Risk
Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.
As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.
Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.
Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer, and the Refinancing Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro- denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. It is difficult to predict the final outcome of the Euro zone crisis. Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Refinancing Notes.
Referendum on the UK’s EU Membership

On 23 June 2016, the UK held an advisory referendum with respect to its continued membership of the EU (the “Referendum”). The result of the Referendum was a vote in favour of leaving the EU. Whilst the result of the Referendum itself is clear, the next steps of the UK executive and UK Parliament and the reaction of the other Member States to these steps is not. In particular, the format of the negotiations, the negotiation positions of the participants and timeframe are uncertain, with any limited public statements subject to change.
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Article 50”) provides that a Member State which decides to withdraw from the EU is required to notify the European Council of its intention to do so.
The UK government gave formal notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 on 29 March 2017, which triggered the commencement of a negotiation process between the UK and the EU in respect of the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Article 50 provides for a two year period for such negotiations to take place (unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK unanimously decides to extend this period, in respect of which see below) (the “Article 50 Period”).
It is possible that the UK will leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement in place, which could result in political and economic uncertainty. Investors should be aware that the Issuer's risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.
Applicability of EU law in the UK

It is at present unclear what type of relationship between the UK and the EU will be established, or at what date (whether by the time when, or after, the UK ceases to be a member of the EU), or what would be the content of such a relationship. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so.
Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future EU-UK relationship, EU laws (other than those EU laws transposed into English law (see below)) will cease to apply within the UK pursuant to the terms and timing of a future withdrawal agreement. This would be achieved by the UK ceasing to be party to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by the parallel repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. The UK will cease to be a member of the EU from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, if a withdrawal agreement has not been concluded, two years after the notification under Article 50 was served, unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period (in respect of which see below).
On 25 November 2018, a negotiated withdrawal agreement was endorsed by leaders at a special meeting of the European Council. The negotiated withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period, which would start on the date of entry into force of the agreement, which it stated to be 30 March 2019, and to end on 31 December 2020, unless extended by a single decision for up to one or two years. The negotiated
withdrawal agreement stated that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law would be applicable to and in the UK during the transition period.
However, the UK government needs the approval of the UK Parliament in order to ratify the negotiated withdrawal agreement, which has not yet been forthcoming.
In response to a second UK request to extend the Article 50 Period, on 11 April 2019 the European Council adopted its decision to extend the Article 50 Period until 31 October 2019.
On 9 September 2019, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 received Royal Assent and passed into law. This legislation provided that if by 19 October 2019, either a deal had not been ratified by the UK Parliament or “no deal” had not been approved by the UK Parliament, the UK Government would be required to request from the EU an extension to the UK’s departure date to 31 January 2020 (or another date if the UK Parliament approved a date suggested by the EU). Although the UK Government and the EU reached an agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement on 17 October 2019, this revised deal had not been approved by the UK Parliament by 19 October 2019. On that day, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, the UK Government sent a request for a further extension to the Article 50 Period to the President of the EU Council. This request was accompanied, however, by a further communication indicating that the UK Government did not wish the EU to grant such an extension.
At this time it is not possible to state with certainty if and when any withdrawal agreement will be entered into, what might be the final terms and effective date of such a withdrawal agreement or the date on which any transition period will end if such an agreement is entered into.
Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.
Regulatory Risk – UK Collateral Manager

If the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK, or a Dutch exemption, is not in place, then (a) a UK manager such as the Collateral Manager may be unable to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer in reliance upon the passporting of relevant regulated services within the EU on a cross-border basis provided for under MiFID II and (b) the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder to the extent it was holding the retention solely as “sponsor” in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (even if the Collateral Manager were to remain subject to UK financial services regulation). See “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements –Transparency Requirements” below.
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available
Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred
by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES
2.1 Regulatory Initiatives
In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be, increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.
This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.
None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Agents, the Trustee nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Refinancing Notes for legal, investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Refinancing Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All investors whose investment activities are subject to: investment laws, rules and regulations (including risk retention laws, rules and regulations that apply currently to the investor, or which may do so in the future); regulatory capital requirements; or to review by regulatory authorities, should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes are subject to any such investment or other restrictions and to unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Agents, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Refinancing Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor's investment in the Refinancing Notes).
Regulations Affecting Investors. All investors whose investment activities are subject to investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities (including the introduction or proposal of risk retention rules) should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Agents, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the structure of the Refinancing Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory or other framework, including as any such framework applies to any investor's investment in the Refinancing Notes.
2.2 Basel III and Basel IV
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and has proposed certain revisions to the securitisation framework. Basel III provides for a substantial strengthening of existing prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) requires legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities
(for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the framework of Directive 2009/138/EC in the European Union.
In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks' RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework's standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.
Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Refinancing Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Refinancing Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.
2.3 Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements
Securitisation Regulation

Background

A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the CRR (as defined in the Conditions) (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).
There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below. Most of the relevant technical standards have not yet been adopted.
Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Refinancing Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Refinancing Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder, their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Refinancing Notes and the transactions described herein are
compliant with the EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements or any other applicable legal regulatory or other requirements. No such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements.
Due-diligence Requirements for Institutional Investors

The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”). Such Institutional Investors include institutions for occupational retirement provision, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the CRR, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).
These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified (among other things) that: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investor; (ii) the originator, sponsor or securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which see “Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation; and (iv) where the originator or original lender is established in a non-EU country, credit granting criteria apply that are substantially similar to those in (iii).
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.
Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those Institutional Investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge in respect of the Refinancing Notes acquired by the relevant investor.
Risk Retention Obligation

The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or of up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover (the “Pecuniary Sanctions”).
Any such Pecuniary Sanction levied on the Retention Holder may materially adversely affect the ability of the Retention Holder to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.
With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the statements set out in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below.
In particular, investors should note that the Retention Holder initially intends to retain such material economic interest as “sponsor” pursuant to the EU Retention Requirements. However, if the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of MiFID II and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK is not in place, then, unless the Collateral Manager elects to take any Retention Cure Action in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents, it may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder. As detailed in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – The Retention” below, the Collateral Manager may in its sole discretion having determined that a Retention
Compliance Event has occurred (or with the passage of time is reasonably likely to occur) take any Retention Cure Action which may include, but is not limited to, qualifying as an “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, subject to: (i) internal approval of the Retention Cure Action in accordance with the Collateral Manager’s internal policies and procedures and
(ii) receipt of legal advice from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, DLA Piper UK LLP or other reputable legal counsel as selected in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion that such Retention Cure Action is consistent with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).
Transparency Requirements

The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e. the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting requirements in Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) (the “Transparency Requirements”). The reporting entity must make certain prescribed information available to holders of a securitisation position, to the relevant competent authorities (“Competent Authorities”) and, upon request, to potential investors.
Under Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing. It is not possible to make final documentation available before pricing and so the Collateral Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer), has made draft documentation available in substantially final form (which may be subject to change following pricing) by way of a website (see http://sf.citidirect.com). Such Transaction Documents in final form will be available on and after the Issue Date.
Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) (“Inside Information”); and, where applicable, information on “significant events” (“Significant Events”). Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and, to the extent applicable, Significant Events are required to be made available “without delay”.
The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and at the latest one month after each Payment Date. With respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports are required to be made available simultaneously not more than three months after the most recent publication of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports, or within three months of the Issue Date. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.
On 22 August 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) published its final report on the technical standards under the Transparency Requirements containing detailed draft disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports, Investor Reports and, in relation to public transactions only, Inside Information and Significant Events (the “Transparency RTS”). The European Commission stated that it did not endorse these draft Transparency RTS in its letter to ESMA dated 30 November 2018. ESMA submitted revised Transparency RTS to the Commission on 31 January 2019. The Commission adopted these revised Transparency RTS on 16 October 2019. The European Parliament and the Council have a prescribed period following the Commission’s adoption in which they may object to the Transparency RTS. The application date of the technical standards has not yet been specified. There remains significant uncertainty as to the scope and the application date of the reporting requirements contained in the Transparency RTS.
The transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the Transparency Requirements provide that until the application of the Transparency RTS, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 (the “CRA3 RTS”). Currently, there is no
dedicated CRA3 RTS template for CLO transactions (other than with respect to content of Investor Reports set out in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS), nor is it expected that one will be developed in accordance with the CRA3 RTS.
On 30 November 2018, the European Banking Authority (the “EBA”), ESMA and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (the “European Supervisory Authorities” or “ESAs”) published a joint statement (the “Joint Statement”) regarding the reporting templates to be used for the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports (the “Article 7 Quarterly Reporting Requirements”) in the period until the Transparency RTS apply.
The ESAs stated that they expect Competent Authorities to generally apply their supervisory powers in their day-to-day supervision and enforcement of applicable legislation in a proportionate and risk-based manner. This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities. The ESAs also noted that they expect that difficulties with compliance will be solved with the final application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS. As such, the Joint Statement from the ESAs should be viewed as a temporary measure. The Joint Statement went on to state that this approach does not entail general forbearance, but a case-by-case assessment by the Competent Authorities of the degree of compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. As the Joint Statement does not “grandfather” transactions that are issued after 1 January 2019 but before the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, such transactions, including the transaction described herein, will need to comply with the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS once they apply.
In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) and make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports (see “Description of the Reports”).
Transparency Requirements – Collateral Manager and Issuer arrangements

In relation to the Transparency Requirements: (a) the Issuer will be designated as the reporting entity;
(b) the Collateral Manager will undertake in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the Transparency Requirements; and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available (or procure that such information is made available) via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager and as further notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies (substantially in the form set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator from time to time) (which certificate may be given electronically and upon which certificate the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is a competent authority, a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes (and in such other manner as required by any competent authority (as instructed to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator)). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.
Once the Transparency RTS apply, the Loan Reports and Investor Reports will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Transparency RTS. Prior to the application of the disclosure templates in the Transparency RTS, the Issuer intends to fulfil the requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and
(e) of Article 7(l) through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”). The Joint Statement is not a legally binding document and there is currently uncertainty in relation to the legal position as regards the form of quarterly reporting until the date of application of the Transparency RTS. Investors should note that it is for relevant Competent Authorities to determine whether they consider that this form of reporting satisfies the Transparency Requirements and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager as the originator, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any other person gives any assurance as to whether this form of reporting will satisfy the Transparency Requirements.
Whether the Collateral Manager will be able to obtain and provide to the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator all of the information required to be reported in accordance with the Transparency Requirements is unclear.
Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the sponsor as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer (to the extent the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer)), or by Collateral Manager, to fulfil the Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation.
The Collateral Manager is required to indemnify the Issuer for Collateral Manager Breaches in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Collateral Manager may be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager (See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” below).
If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Refinancing Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Refinancing Notes; and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Refinancing Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.
U.S. Risk Retention Rules

On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset- backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset- backed securities.
On February 9, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) ruled in favour of the LSTA in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As a result, the Collateral Manager has informed the Issuer that no party expects to be required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and none of the Collateral Manager or its affiliates will have any obligation to hold any Notes for any period of time, on the basis that it intends to qualify as an “open market CLO”. It should be noted that the LSTA decision (the “LSTA Decision”) did not specifically address all of the features of the current transaction (including whether an “open market CLO” includes transactions such as this one, in which the Issuer is permitted to acquire bonds in addition to loans. However, consistent with an “open market CLO”, the Issuer is expected to acquire any bonds pursuant to arms-length negotiations in the open market. There can be no assurance that the federal agencies responsible for the U.S. Risk Retention Rules will not seek to distinguish this transaction from the open market CLOs covered by the LSTA Decision and apply the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to this transaction.
No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for the type of transaction contemplated herein, and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.
If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.
In the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuers’ ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to any consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Noteholders).
Recent developments concerning the treatment of CLOs for certain Japanese investors

On March 15, 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitisation Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitisation Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitisation exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitisation, including the establishment and utilisation of a due diligence system for evaluating securitised products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitisation transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitisation Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organisation of the securitised product,” retains at least 5% of the securitised exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitisation Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5% retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitised exposures”).
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Refinancing Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining Subordinated Notes with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed,” that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitisation Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
2.4 Restrictions on the Discretion of the Collateral Manager in Order to Comply with EU Risk Retention
 The aim behind the relevant retention requirements described in “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - Transparency Requirements” above is that affected investors should only invest in securitisations where the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitisation has explicitly disclosed that it will continue to hold and retain on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation. The five per cent. net economic interest is measured as the nominal value of the securitised exposures, calculated based on the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount. The Retention Holder has agreed to retain such an interest in the transaction by holding Subordinated Notes having a Principal Amount Outstanding multiplied by the price at which such Subordinated Notes were purchased by the Retention Holder being, at any time, an amount equal to or greater than 5 per cent. of the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount.
 Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
 In particular, if, at any time, the deposit of Trading Gains into the Principal Account would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency, such Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments will instead be deposited into the Interest Account. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds if the reinvestment of such amount would, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In addition, the Collateral Manager is not permitted to reinvest in Substitute Collateral Obligations where such reinvestment would cause a Retention Deficiency. As a result, the Collateral Manager may be prevented from reinvesting available proceeds in Collateral Obligations in circumstances where such reinvestment would cause (or would be likely to cause) a Retention Deficiency and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise have been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations.
 Also, the Issuer may not issue further Notes without the Retention Holder (a) consenting to such issuance and (b) subscribing for sufficient Subordinated Notes so as not to result in non- compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
As a result of such restrictions, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, may be restricted from building or maintaining the par value of the Collateral in certain circumstances under which they would otherwise be able to do so, in order to comply with the provisions of the Conditions intended to achieve ongoing compliance with the applicable retention requirements.
2.5 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (see “Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below), credit institutions and insurance companies, or other entities which are “non-financial counterparties” (or third country entities equivalent to “financial counterparties” or “non-financial counterparties”).
Financial counterparties (“FCs”) (as defined in EMIR) are subject to a general obligation to clear through a duly authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC
derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties subject to the clearing obligation. They must also report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”), and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). As further discussed in “Margin requirements” below, FCs must exchange margin in respect of all non-cleared OTC derivatives unless such OTC derivatives are excluded from the scope of the relevant margin rules (the “margin requirement”). To the extent that the Issuer becomes FC, this may lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements or restricting of their terms.
Non-financial counterparties (as defined in EMIR) are exempted from the clearing obligation and certain additional risk mitigation obligations (as well as the margin requirement) provided the gross notional value of all derivative contracts entered into by the non-financial counterparty and other non-financial entities within its “group”, excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives). If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non- financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. If the Issuer exceeds the applicable thresholds and its swaps become subject to mandatory clearing, this may also lead to a termination of the Hedge Agreements.
Key details in respect of the clearing obligation and the margin requirement and their applicability to certain classes of OTC derivative contracts are to be provided through corresponding regulatory technical standards. Whilst regulatory technical standards have been published in respect of certain classes of OTC derivative contracts, others are yet to be proposed.
Clearing obligation

The regulatory technical standards governing the mandatory clearing obligation for certain classes of OTC derivative contracts which entered into force on 21 December 2015 specify that the clearing obligation in respect of interest rate OTC derivative contracts that are (i) basis swaps and fixed-to floating swaps denominated in euro, GBP, USD and Japanese Yen and (ii) forward rate agreements and overnight swaps denominated in euro, GBP and USD, in each case, would take effect on dates ranging from 21 June 2016 (for major market participants grouped under “Category 1”) to 21 December 2018 (for non- financial counterparties that are not AIFs grouped under “Category 4”).
Margin requirements

On 4 October 2016, the European Commission adopted regulatory technical standards on risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central clearing counterparty to the European Commission (the “RTS”). The RTS were published in the Official Journal on 15 December 2016 and entered into force on 4 January 2017.
The RTS detail the risk mitigation obligations and margin requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives as well as specify the criteria regarding intragroup exemptions and provide that the margin requirement will take effect on dates ranging, originally, from one month after the RTS enter into force (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €3 trillion) to 1 September 2020 (for certain entities with a non-cleared OTC derivative portfolio above €8 billion). The margin requirements apply to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin.
If the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions or significantly increase the cost thereof, negatively affecting the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or hedge its interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs, additional regulatory requirements and limitations on ability of the Issuer to hedge interest rate and
currency risk, the amounts payable to Noteholders may be negatively affected as the Collateral Manager may be precluded from executing its investment strategy in full.
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR-related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.
The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to amend the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in future.
Prospective investors should be aware that the regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (including the potential for non- financial counterparties such as the Issuer to become subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as Currency Hedge Transactions and Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter the currency hedge swaps and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and/or manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Refinancing Notes.
Prospective investors should also be aware that on 4 May 2017, the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation amending EMIR as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (the “EMIR Refit”).
The final version of EMIR REFIT was published in the EU Official Journal on 28 May 2019, with the majority of the amendments to EMIR coming into force from 17 June 2019.
The most significant amendment in EMIR REFIT is the change to the definition of financial counterparty (“FC”). EMIR REFIT brings into that definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”). Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be non-financial counterparties (“NFCs”) if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds would be out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs. Under the amended definition of a FC in EMIR REFIT, such funds will now be regarded as TCEs that would be FCs if they were established in the EU, meaning that EU FCs will be required to ensure compliance with the clearing obligation and margin requirements for uncleared derivatives in respect of their trading with such funds.
Despite the initial proposal by the European Commission including securitisation special purpose entities (“SSPEs”, defined by reference to the AIFMD) in the revised financial counterparty definition, the final version published in the Official Journal instead provides a specific exclusion for such entities from categorisation as a financial counterparty.
EMIR REFIT also amends the clearing obligation through the introduction of a new category of “small financial counterparty”, subject to similar clearing thresholds as non-financial counterparties. Another amendment provides that where the clearing threshold has been exceeded by a non-financial counterparty in one asset category, that non-financial counterparty will only have to clear derivatives in that category, rather than for all asset categories (as was the case in the original EMIR). Other amendments in EMIR REFIT include a relaxation of the reporting requirements for non-financial counterparties below the clearing threshold, the imposition of a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms” access standard for clearing members providing clearing services and new powers for ESMA and the Commission to suspend the clearing obligation for certain classes of derivative.
2.6 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. The Collateral Manager would not be permitted to be authorised under both AIFMD and under MiFID II. It would therefore not be able to apply for authorisation under AIFMD unless it ceases to maintain its current MiFID II (in which case it may not be able to hold the retention as a “sponsor” as required under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (see “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - Transparency Requirements” above)). If considered to be an AIF managed by an AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR Refit, all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.
There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”). The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it.
If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.
The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.
2.7 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new Offering Circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.
None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Refinancing Notes.
2.8 U.S. Swap Regulations
Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) and the availability of such Hedge Transactions (for example the recent CFTC final rules on margining). Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and in some cases traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps, (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.
Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but have yet to become effective. It is expected that such regulations will become effective in the next two years, but the SEC has yet to set a compliance date. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.
2.9 Commodity Pool Regulation
The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements should not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its directors, officers or employees to register with the CFTC as a CPO or a CTA.
In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5 per cent. of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100 per cent. of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs.
Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.
Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.
Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.
2.10 Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.
An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.
It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see “Commodity Pool Regulation”, above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.
The Transaction Documents provide that the Noteholders’ rights in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement Collateral Manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. Furthermore, the holders of any of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes or the Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in instruments issued by the Issuer not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.
The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.
If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund” the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer or enter into certain credit related financial transactions with the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Refinancing Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Refinancing Notes.
In 2018, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule approved for issuance a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend certain aspects of the implementing regulations not relevant to this transaction. As part of that notice, though, the agencies also requested public comment on the need for potential changes to virtually all aspects of the implementing regulations, including those aspects of the regulations relevant to securitizations and their treatment under the Volcker Rule’s covered fund provisions. Two of the agencies – the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – adopted in final form final regulations consistent with the 2018 proposal, and the remaining three agencies are expected to approve the changes shortly. In connection with the adoption of these final regulations, the agencies stated that further proposed amendments may be forthcoming, including modifications to the provisions related to “covered funds”. It is unclear at this time what changes (if any) ultimately will be made to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations arising from this public comment process, and whether any such changes will affect the ability of banking entities to acquire and retain any of the Refinancing Notes or to exercise voting rights with respect to the selection or replacement of the Collateral Manager.
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Refinancing Notes. Each prospective investor in the Refinancing Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Refinancing Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.
2.11 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Refinancing Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Refinancing Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.
2.12 Flip Clauses
The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payment (such as the Priorities of Payment) which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.
The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.
On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY Case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.
The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.
Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priority of Payments and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.
2.13 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform
The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has been reformed, with developments including:
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the UK (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers’ Association in February 2014;
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.
In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.
The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.
It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021.
If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.
The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, “EURIBOR”), together with LIBOR, and other so-called “benchmarks” are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.
In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU
The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by
way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively.
Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator.
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):
(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and
(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.
Investors should be aware that:
(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”;
(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:
(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and
(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;
(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Rated Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fallback mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders, provided that the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders have consented within the timescale provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Rated Notes.
2.14 Financial Transaction Tax – (“FTT”)
In February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, other than Estonia, the “Participating Member States”). However, on 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.
Under the Commission Proposal, the proposed FTT would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State or the financial instrument in which the parties are dealing is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.
Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain.
Additional Member States may also decide to participate in the FTT. Prospective holders of the Refinancing Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to any FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Refinancing Notes before investing.
2.15 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures
Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “AML Requirements”). Any of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Agents could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Refinancing Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the corporate services provider who is providing managing directors to the Issuer, the Agents, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. In addition, it is expected that each of the Issuer, the Agents, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith. A Noteholder may also be obliged to provide information they may have previously identified or regarded as confidential to satisfy the Issuer AML Requirements.
2.16 CRA
CRA Regulation in Europe

Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013. Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10
per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Refinancing Notes.
2.17 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
On 5 October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.
The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” (“LOB”) rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.
The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.
On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included The Netherlands and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.
The United Kingdom and The Netherlands signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 June 2018 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. On 29 March 2019, The Netherlands deposited its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval with the OECD and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of The Netherlands on 1 July 2019. The changes made by the Multilateral Instrument to the CTA do not have effect immediately following entry into force with respect to The Netherlands (except for the mutual agreement and arbitration provisions, which will generally apply to cases presented on or after 1 July 2019) but, instead, apply to taxes withheld at source, and for the purposes of all other taxes, from 1 January 2020.
Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument the United Kingdom and The Netherlands each deposited a list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument Action 6 would be implemented into the double tax treaties The Netherlands has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions by the inclusion of a PPT.
In particular it remains to be seen what specific changes will be made to the UK/The Netherlands double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of The Netherlands, in denying the Issuer the benefit of The Netherlands’ network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.
It is also possible that The Netherlands will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.
Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti- Tax Avoidance Directive 2)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.
2.18 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2
As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive must be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.
Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward.
The implementation of the abovementioned interest deductibility limitation rule in The Netherlands has entered into effect on 1 January 2019. The interest deductibility limitation rule adopted in The Netherlands is more strict than prescribed by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, reducing the threshold for deductible interest to EUR 1,000,000 (instead of EUR 3,000,000) and eliminating a number of safe harbours that were included in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.
However, the restriction on interest deductibility only applies in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed "interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets". Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain.
On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches between EU Member States and third countries, which the EU Council adopted on 29 May 2017 in Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 ("Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2"). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny or (in some circumstances) delay deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in the case of hybrid mismatches (for example, in certain cases where a deduction occurs in one year and so-called dual inclusion income arises in a later year). Hybrid mismatches are the result of differences in tax law between jurisdictions. For instance, one jurisdiction may qualify a financial instrument as equity while another jurisdiction qualifies the same instrument as debt. As a result, the remuneration paid for the financial instrument may be a deductible interest payment in one jurisdiction, while it qualifies as exempt dividend income in the other. Hybrid mismatches can also occur if an entity is transparent (disregarded for tax purposes) in one country and opaque (or non-transparent) in another country. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 needs to be implemented in the EU Member States' national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and will have to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches, for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will have to apply as of 1 January 2022.
A legislative proposal implementing the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 was published on 29 June 2019. The Netherlands intend to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 per 1 January 2020, although some of the provisions (regarding reverse hybrids) will not be in effect until 1 January 2022.
Generally speaking, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will only be of relevance in case of payments between related parties; however, Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will also impact structured arrangements whereby the tax benefit of a hybrid mismatch has been included in the pricing (i.e. based on an agreement between two non-related parties). In situations where (i) the taxpayer could not have reasonably been aware of the hybrid mismatch and (ii) does not benefit from such mismatch, a hybrid mismatch that may occur between third parties should not be affected by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 rules. Considering that the Issuer’s main purpose is receiving and paying interest on a regular basis from and to unrelated parties, the implementation of Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 may be of limited relevance to the Issuer.
The exact scope of these measures, and impact on the Issuer’s tax position (if any), will depend on the implementation of the measures in The Netherlands.
2.19 Taxation implications of contributions
A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a contribution, designate as a contribution to the Issuer all or a specified portion of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be distributed to such Subordinated Noteholder or subscribe for additional Subordinated Notes in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts). Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax treatment in respect of the contribution in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts).
2.20 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer
The Issuer expects to earn a minimum profit that is subject to Dutch corporate tax but that no Dutch VAT should be payable on the Collateral Management Fees, subject to what follows. This is on the basis of article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT act based upon Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU member states shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” (as defined by the relevant EU member state). There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will not be or in the future become subject to further tax by the Netherlands or some other jurisdiction. In the event that tax is imposed on the Issuer, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes may be impaired.
In its judgement of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs C-595/13 (“ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X”) the European Court of Justice has ruled that the VAT exemption for investment management services can be applied to: (i) funds which constitute undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities within the meaning of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive (Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (as amended from time to time) including any implementing and/or delegated regulations, technical standards and guidance related thereto, the “UCITS Directive”) and (ii) funds which, without being collective investment undertakings within the meaning of that directive, display features that are sufficiently comparable for them to be in competition with such undertakings in particular that they are subject to specific State supervision under national law (as opposed to under the UCITS Directive).
Following the ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X case, there is a risk that the Issuer may not qualify as a “special investment fund” under the VAT Directive and/or the Dutch value added tax act. The Issuer (and other Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles) has the benefit of a tax ruling from the Dutch tax authorities (which pre-dates the ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X case), confirming that the relevant VAT exemption can be applied for collateral management services to Dutch collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including the Issuer, once it is registered with the designated tax inspector). The Issuer has been advised that although case law from the ECJ and Dutch courts confirms that CLO SPVs can be considered sufficiently comparable to UCITS and therefore should qualify as a “special investment fund” within the meaning of Article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT Act and Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive respectively, the Issuer cannot exclude that the Dutch tax authorities may seek to change their position in the future and Dutch value added tax may be imposed on the Collateral Management Fees.
On 23 February 2018, the Dutch Secretary of Finance published a policy letter stating the government's intentions to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance. On the basis of these plans, it has been proposed to introduce a withholding tax on intragroup interest and royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions and non- cooperative jurisdictions as of 2021. On 18 September 2018, the Dutch government released its Budget 2019 containing the Tax Plan for 2019, including a proposal for a new Withholding Tax Act ("WTA") on dividend distributions. According to the proposed WTA, only dividend payments made to group
companies that are tax residents of EU blacklisted jurisdictions and low tax jurisdictions (with a statutory tax rate for business profits of less than 7 per cent) are to be subject to such withholding tax. The proposed legislation to introduce a new withholding tax on intragroup interest and royalty payments is expected to be published in the course of 2019. Although on 15 October 2018 the Dutch government decided to postpone the WTA, it is reasonable to expect that the new withholding tax on interest and royalties will eventually become part of the WTA. In the explanatory notes pertaining to the WTA, it was noted that the withholding tax rates on interest and royalties – if applicable – will be the same as the corporate income tax rate (expected to be 20.5 per cent in 2021). Considering that all the relevant publications from the government thus far solely refer to intragroup payments, the debt instruments that are issued in the market and/or listed such as the Notes are unlikely to be covered by the new withholding tax to be introduced.
On 17 September 2019 the Dutch government published a legislative proposal for a withholding tax on interest and royalties payments to associated companies in low-taxed jurisdictions and in abusive situations. In principle, the term “associated companies” refers to companies with either a direct or indirect decisive influence on the Dutch resident company. The exact threshold percentage in the future legislation has not been announced, nor do we expect it. Generally speaking, a shareholding of 50 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the voting rights would qualify. Low-taxed jurisdictions are the jurisdictions included on the EU-blacklist of low-taxed and uncooperative jurisdictions, plus jurisdictions included on the Dutch low-taxed jurisdictions list that was published as part of the new Dutch controlled foreign company legislation. Currently, low-taxed jurisdictions include American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, Guam, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrain, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Cayman Islands, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu and the United Arab Emirates. In certain abusive situations payments made by a Dutch resident company to an intermediary company that is not located in a low-taxed jurisdiction may also be subject to withholding tax. The tax rate of the conditional withholding tax will be equal to the regular tax rate of the Dutch corporate income tax (21.7 per cent. in 2021).
2.21 S&P
On 21 January 2015, the SEC entered into administrative settlement agreements with S&P with respect to, among other things, multiple allegations of making misleading public statements with respect to its ratings methodology and certain misleading publications concerning criteria and research, in each case relating to commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions. S&P neither admitted nor denied the charges in these settlements. As a result of these settlement agreements, the SEC ordered S&P censured and enjoined S&P from violating the statutory provisions and rules related to the allegations described above. Additionally, S&P agreed to pay civil penalties and other disgorgements exceeding $76 million. On 3 February 2015, S&P entered into a settlement agreement with the United States Justice Department, 19 States and the District of Columbia, to settle lawsuits relating to S&P’s alleged inflation of ratings on subprime mortgage bonds. S&P did not admit to any wrongdoing in connection with such settlement. Also on 3 February 2015, S&P entered into a settlement agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement System to resolve claims over three structured investment vehicles. Under the 3 February 2015 settlement agreements, S&P agreed to pay approximately $1.5 billion in the aggregate to the related claimants.
While none of these settlements concern S&P ratings of CLOs, alleged inaccuracy of S&P ratings for one type of securitisation may raise questions as to their accuracy for other types of securitisations, including CLOs.
2.22 The Common Reporting Standard
The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) (“FIs”) relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.
Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Co-operation in the Field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU) (“DAC II”) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year (or from 2018 in the case of Austria).
The Netherlands is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of CRS.
Over 95 jurisdictions have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and a group of 50 countries, including The Netherlands and all EU Member States other than Austria (known as the “Early Adopter Group”) committed to the early adoption of the CRS from 1 January 2016. The Early Adopter Group activated their exchange relationships under the CRS and commenced the exchange of data in September 2017. In November 2017, a further 53 jurisdictions committed to activating their exchange relationships by September 2018.
The Netherlands has enacted legislation to implement the requirements of the CRS and DAC II into Dutch law under which Dutch FIs (such as the Issuer) will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, a Dutch FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Dutch Tax Authorities (Belastingdienst). The information will be provided to the Dutch Tax Authorities (Belastingdienst) who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by the Issuer to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Dutch legislation.
The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance,
(iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors.
2.23 Regulated Banking Activity
While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds). Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non-bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.
Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application
of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Refinancing Notes.
2.24 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.
The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”) to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.
The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone (such as the UK) has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.
2.25 U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts
U.S. regulators have adopted final rules and interpretative guidance setting forth limitations on certain insolvency-related default rights of parties to certain “qualified financial contracts” (“QFCs”) entered into with counterparties that have been designated as systemically important, along with certain of such entities’ subsidiaries and affiliates (each, a “Covered Entity”). Such rules and guidance (the “QFC Stay Rules”) generally require: (i) the Covered Entity to ensure that any stays imposed as a result of the entry of such entity into certain liquidation proceedings are contractually acknowledged by the counterparty to the QFC (in particular, where the relevant QFC is governed by non-U.S. law and/or the counterparty is located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction); and (ii) the Covered Entity to not agree in its QFCs to certain types of cross-defaults that are related, directly or indirectly, to the entry into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding of certain affiliates of the Covered Entity. If a Covered Entity enters into a contract with the Issuer that is subject to the QFC Stay Rules, the Covered Entity will be responsible for ensuring that such QFC complies with the QFC Stay Rules. As a result of the application of such rules, the Issuer may be required to accept limitations in its insolvency-related default rights against the Covered Entity.
2.26 Centre of Main Interests
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings (recast), which came into force on 26 June 2017, the centre of main interests (“COMI”) shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
The Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands. As a result there is a rebuttable presumption that its centre of main interests (“COMI”) is in The Netherlands and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings applicable to it would be governed by Dutch law. In the decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ restated the presumption in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings, that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect”. As the Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands has Dutch directors and is registered for tax in The Netherlands, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI is not located in The Netherlands and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, Dutch insolvency proceedings would not be applicable to the Issuer.
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer
Neither the Sole Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of their affiliates) is under any obligation to make a secondary market in relation to the Refinancing Notes. The Refinancing Notes are illiquid investments. Any indicative prices provided by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be determined in the Initial Purchaser’s sole discretion taking into account prevailing market conditions and shall not be a representation by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates that any instrument can be purchased or sold at such prices (or at all). Notwithstanding the above, the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may suspend or terminate making a market and/or providing indicative prices without notice, at any time and for any reason. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Refinancing Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Refinancing Notes or that any available sale price will be at par. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Refinancing Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Refinancing Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors (as the case may be) to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action.
Furthermore, the Refinancing Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Refinancing Notes under the Securities Act. The Refinancing Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Refinancing Notes may further limit their liquidity.
In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non- Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
3.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility
The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may, in some cases, require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
3.3 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class.
The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds:
(a) on any Business Day on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices);
(b) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution (as evidenced by duly completed Redemption Notices); or
(c) (along with the Subordinated Notes) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event at the direction of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution,
in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Collateral Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).

As described in Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing) subject to certain conditions at the option of the Subordinated Noteholders but subject to the consent of the Collateral Manager, Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. See Condition 7(b)(v) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing).

Prospective investors in the Subordinated Notes should note that their ability to direct or elect for optional redemption of the Rated Notes (in whole or in part by Class) in the above circumstances is subject to the
consent of the Collateral Manager at the time, which consent may be withheld in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion.
The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing is obtained meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed, the Issuer may amend the Trust Deed and the Trustee shall concur with such amendments to the Trust Deed and no further consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Subordinated Notes. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).
The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution).
The Collateral Manager or the Retention Holder may also cause the Issuer to redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 15 per cent. of the Target Par Amount.
In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.
3.4 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the Option of the Collateral Manager
The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if either (A) the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its sole discretion certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) that, using commercially reasonable endeavours, it has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria, in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations, or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in its sole discretion notifies the Trustee in writing that, as determined by the Collateral Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner, a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event (upon which notification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability). On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.
3.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes
Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders,
the Class E Noteholders and the Class F Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including the breach of any of the Coverage Tests or an Effective Date Rating Event. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).
3.6 The Reinvestment Period may Terminate Early
The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager notifies the Issuer that it is unable to invest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.
3.7 The Collateral Manager may Reinvest After the end of the Reinvestment Period
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period” below. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.
3.8 Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and a Note Event of Default
(a) Additional Issuances
The Issuer may from time to time during the Reinvestment Period, subject to certain conditions set out in Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) including but not limited to the prior approval of the Collateral Manager and the Retention Holder, create and issue further Notes (other than the Class X Notes) and use the proceeds of sale thereof to purchase additional Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of an issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) to be applied towards a Permitted Use. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).
(b) Collateral Manager Advances
The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances pursuant to Condition 3(k) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised. Outstanding Collateral Manager Advances may accrue interest at a rate of not more than EURIBOR plus 4.0 per cent. per annum.
(c) Reinvestment Amounts
Subordinated Noteholders may elect to make a Reinvestment Amount in accordance with Condition 3(c)(iv) (Reinvestment Amounts) by contributing assets to the Issuer either directly or indirectly by designating distributions that would otherwise be made by the Issuer to the Subordinated Noteholder as a contribution back from the Subordinated Noteholder to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will decide (in consultation with the relevant Subordinated Noteholder but at the discretion of the Collateral Manager) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount would be applied.
Any Reinvestment Amounts contributed by Subordinated Noteholders in cash are required to be in a minimum denomination of €1,000,000 and no more than three such cash contributions may be made by the Subordinated Noteholders.
Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the
highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see “Average Life and Prepayment Considerations” below).
3.9 Additional Issuances of Subordinated Notes not subject to Anti-Dilution Rights
The Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes (other than Class X Notes), subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including that the holders of the relevant Class of Notes in respect of which further Notes are issued shall have been afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. However, this requirement does not apply to any additional issuance of Subordinated Notes if such issuance is required in order to prevent or cure a Retention Deficiency for any reason. Accordingly, the proportion of Subordinated Notes held by a Subordinated Noteholder may be diluted following an additional issuance of Subordinated Notes. See Condition 17 (Additional Issuances).

3.10 Limited Recourse Obligations
The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders of any Class, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets including the Issuer Dutch Account and its rights within the Issuer Management Agreement (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchaser, the Retention Holder, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class F Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class E Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class D Noteholders;
(e) fifthly, the Class C Noteholders; (e) sixthly, the Class B Noteholders; and (f) lastly, the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders (on a pro rata and pari passu basis), in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders
Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.
3.12 Subordination of the Notes
The Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes and the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes.
The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Rated Notes has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied towards a Permitted Use in accordance with the Conditions and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account in the event that the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.
Non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non- payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment will not constitute a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class C Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class D Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and following redemption if full of the Class E Notes failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class F Notes when the same becomes due and payable, (in each case where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission).
In such circumstances, the Controlling Class, acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default).

In the event of any acceleration of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Noteholders.
Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of the most senior Class of Notes Outstanding. In the event that the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).

3.13 Calculation of Rate of Interest
If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Collateral Manager will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Rate of Interest in respect of the Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.
If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Collateral Manager is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis.
3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments
To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, or to pay scheduled interest on the Class D Notes, or to pay scheduled interest on the Class E Notes or to pay scheduled interest on the Class F Notes or to pay interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event such Class is the senior most Class of Notes Outstanding. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available
for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.
Investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
3.15 Reports Provided by the Collateral Administrator Will Not Be Audited
The Monthly Reports and Payment Date Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.
3.16 Ratings of the Rated Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. If a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.
Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments and do not evaluate the risks of fluctuations in market value, and therefore, credit ratings do not fully reflect all risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, and the credit quality of a debt security may be worse than a rating indicates.
Prospective investors in the Refinancing Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.
The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.
As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under CRA3. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with CRA3. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under CRA3 and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations

Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Refinancing Notes.
If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes will be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the amount described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the Sole Arranger

On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,
(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the “arranger” is the Issuer.
Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.
Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes

The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). In connection with the Effective Date, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires an accountant’s agreed upon procedures report to be delivered to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, and portions of this report may constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g 10. Although the Issuer has agreed to post any certification in the required form that it receives in respect of such portion of such report to the Rule 17g-5 website, it is unclear what, if any, services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10, and consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of the Rated Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations
The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling in 17 April 2032 (subject to adjustment for non-Business Days); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Refinancing Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Refinancing Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, any prepayment fees the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Refinancing Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Refinancing Notes.
Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain

Estimates of the average lives of the Refinancing Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Refinancing Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or
estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
3.18 Volatility of the Subordinated Notes
The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.
In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See “Mandatory Redemption of the Notes” above.
Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.
3.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes
It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Refinancing Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.
3.20 Withholding Tax on the Notes
Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes, there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In addition, under Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer Pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the holder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA.
If any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes (including FATCA), the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.
In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof, including, without limitation, withholding tax in respect of FATCA), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to
pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
3.21 Security
Clearing Systems: Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian for the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.
In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through The Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”), Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.
Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.
Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.
3.22 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.
Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution, or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.
The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum
and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.
Any Notes held by or on behalf of any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any, CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution.
If a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined by reference to the percentage which the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of Notes held or represented by any person or persons who vote in favour of such Resolution represents of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all applicable Notes which are represented at such meeting and are voted and not the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote at such meeting. This means that a lower percentage of Noteholders may pass a Resolution which is put to a meeting of Noteholders than would be required for a Written Resolution in respect of the same matter. There are however quorum provisions which provide that a minimum number of Noteholders representing a minimum amount of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the applicable Class or Classes of Notes be present at any meeting to consider an Extraordinary Resolution or Ordinary Resolution. In the case of an Extraordinary Resolution, this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) and in the case of an Ordinary Resolution this is one or more persons holding or representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable). Such quorum provisions still, however, require considerably lower thresholds than would be required for a Written Resolution. In addition, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed.
Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution.
Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.
Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes and/or as applicable, will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.
Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.
Investors in the Class X Notes should note that the Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions, and the Class X Notes will not, at any point, be or form part of the Controlling Class.
Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders.
Investors should note that for the purposes of determining voting rights attributable to the Notes and the applicable quorum at any meeting of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution).
Certain entrenched rights relating to the Conditions including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution, cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.
In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee, without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver).

Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. The Hedge Agreements may allow a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request. During such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer may not be able to make such modification, amendment or supplement and therefore implementation thereof may be delayed. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification, amendment or supplement of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.
3.23 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes
If at any time one or more investors that are affiliated hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).
3.24 Enforcement Rights Following a Note Event of Default
If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith), give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following the occurrence of a Note Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting and allowing for any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E
Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments or (B) otherwise, in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv) or (vi) of Condition 10 (Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Note Event of Default.
The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement (in particular, where paragraph (B) above does not apply) and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests to certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.
3.25 Certain ERISA Considerations
Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans. In addition, certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled “Certain ERISA Considerations” below.
3.26 Forced Transfer
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA. The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a
U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule 144A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”), the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder demanding that such holder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or within the United States to a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period, (a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer shall cause such Rule 144A Notes to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such Rule 144A Notes.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any Noteholder is a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder, the Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed.
In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that, if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
3.27 U.S. Tax Risks
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and The Netherlands, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Dutch implementing legislation that is expected to require the Issuer to provide the name, address and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to The Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Dutch implementing legislation could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Possible treatment of the Refinancing Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes

The Class E Notes and Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note or Class F Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective “qualified electing fund” election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes. Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of those Notes could be subject to the rules pertaining to 10 per cent. United States shareholders of CFCs. See “Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes - Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes.”
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes are uncertain

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” below.
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL
4.1 The Portfolio
The decision by any prospective holder of Refinancing Notes to invest in such Refinancing Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and the Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case thereafter as disclosed in this Offering Circular. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time (other than as disclosed in the latest Payment Date Report and/or latest Monthly Report contained in
Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto and further described in “Risk Factors – General”). Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.
None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.
Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria and, in respect of Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date, the Original Eligibility Criteria..
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults
The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.
The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.
An investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Refinancing Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.
The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priority of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality
obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.
To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or the Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date
On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Forward Purchase Agreement to acquire the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations from Barclays Bank PLC.
The prices paid for the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations purchased from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement will be the market value (being the price requested by the Collateral Manager (for and on behalf of the Issuer) and agreed to by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement) as at the time Barclays Bank PLC enters into a binding commitment to acquire such assets following receipt of a request from the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to do so for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement. The prices paid for such Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations may therefore be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the time at which Barclays Bank PLC enters into a binding commitment to acquire such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement and the Issue Date (or thereafter), including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations acquired on or prior to the Issue Date.
Investors in the Refinancing Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in each such Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation from the time at which Barclays Bank PLC entered into a binding commitment to acquire such assets following receipt of a request from the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to do so for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, including the risk that any Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date may not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date
For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.
The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies at the time of entering into a binding commitment to acquire a Collateral Obligation provided that (i) an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date, (ii) a Collateral Obligation (other than a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation or an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation) purchased prior to the Issue Date must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the date on which a binding commitment to purchase it was entered into and (iii) a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) requested the acquisition of such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement.
4.4 Considerations Relating to the Subsequent Investment Period
During the Subsequent Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, and Portfolio Profile Tests. See “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend on a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager including its ability to identify a suitable Currency Hedge Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Currency Hedge Transactions. See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.
4.5 Prepayment Risk
Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.
4.6 Defaults and Recoveries
There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations often will share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of
comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.
The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.
A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Refinancing Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes.
Recoveries on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below.
4.7 Underlying Portfolio
Characteristics of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations

The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations in aggregate (which shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the borrower in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Obligations are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually
have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.
Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical senior loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.
Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.
Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Interest Rate Risk” below.
The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.
Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations

In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment
banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.
Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations

The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds

High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.
High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by
investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.
The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.
European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.
In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.
In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks

The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in- possession” financings.
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.
Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Loans

The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Loans. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loans occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.
4.8 Corporate Rescue Loans
Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.
Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.
4.9 Collateral Enhancement Obligations
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are subject to the following caps: (i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €3,000,000 and (ii) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all Payment Dates may not exceed
€9,000,000.
The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any
right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.
To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, on no more than three separate occasions and subject to a minimum payment of €1,000,000 on each such occasion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (such amount, a “Collateral Manager Advance”) to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
4.10 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations
As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.
4.11 Participations, Novations and Assignments
The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans taken indirectly by way of sub participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.
The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the loan agreement. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the borrower all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the borrower. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable loan agreement and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, to set off claims against the borrower and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the borrower
once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the borrower. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The loan agreement usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the loan agreements, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.
Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the borrower under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the borrower. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the applicable loan agreement and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the borrower and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the borrower sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest of the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the loan agreement and the continuing creditworthiness of the borrower. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by a borrower. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institutions may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.
In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above.
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.
4.12 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders
The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.
4.13 Counterparty Risk
Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.
If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction (see “Interest Rate Risk” and “Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions – Currency Risk” below). For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.
Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above. Transactions with counterparties that are Covered Entities for the purposes of the QFC Stay Rules may also be subject to the limitations in such rules. See “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.
4.14 Concentration Risk
Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.

4.15 Credit Risk
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.
4.16 Interest Rate Risk
The Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.
In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above. However, the Issuer will depend on each Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Any termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to interest rate risk mismatch for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty.
In addition, some Collateral Obligations permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following a Frequency Switch Event and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations re-set to semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and re-set mismatches.
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.
On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable, in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank and the Custodian. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance
with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.
4.17 Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions
Currency Risk

The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 25 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limit set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non- Euro Obligation.
Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations are required to be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). Any termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.
Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.
The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.
4.18 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances
To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.
During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds on behalf of the Issuer (see “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of
the Reinvestment Period” above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount. Any decrease in the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.
The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Refinancing Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer and the redemption of the Refinanced Notes on the Issue Date as further described herein and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.
4.19 Ratings on Collateral Obligations
The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a CCC Obligation, a Caa Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value/Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests). The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating. In some instances, the S&P Rating and the Moody’s Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, a confidential credit estimate determined separately by S&P and Moody’s. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In
addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the S&P Rating or Moody’s Rating is derived from the rating of another rating agency. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.

There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations and Caa Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value/Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.
4.20 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations
Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.
4.21 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination
In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.
In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable
subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.
The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.
4.22 Loan Repricing
Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.
4.23 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General
At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can be sheltered by application being made under the applicable double tax treaty; (ii) such withholding tax is a
U.S. federal withholding tax imposed on letter of credit fees, consent fees, commitment fees or similar fees; or (iii) the Obligor is required to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made,
(b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the borrower or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders).
4.24 UK Taxation of the Issuer
In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Managing Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.
The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a fixed place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.
Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the specific domestic UK corporation tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the “Investment Manager Exemption”) is available in the context of this transaction. It should be noted that the Investment Manager Exemption may not be available if the Collateral Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the Subordinated Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the exemption in Article 7(1) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty applies. This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty.
Should the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Imposition of such tax by the United Kingdom tax authorities may also give rise to a Note Tax Event pursuant to which the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a "trade of dealing in or developing UK land", (b) it disposes of "interests in UK land" or certain assets other than "interests in UK land" which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a "substantial indirect interest" in that land, or (c) with effect from 6th April 2020 it carries on a "UK property business" or has other "UK property income". However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.
4.25 Diverted Profits Tax
The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent. of any “taxable diverted profits”. The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident
company’s trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.
4.26 Collateral Manager
The Collateral Manager, is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio” and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. While the Collateral Manager will be responsible for the collateral management and credit decisions with respect to managing the Collateral on behalf of the Issuer, certain day-to-day discretions relating to the composition of the portfolios of the Issuer as well as authority to execute transactions for the Issuer will be delegated to Ares Management Limited (“AML”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”). In addition, AML will: (i) perform certain middle- and back-office functions for the Collateral Manager; (ii) make available certain individuals to perform certain functions for the Collateral Manager; and (iii) provide the Collateral Manager with certain intellectual property licences. The Collateral Manager procures these services pursuant to a services agreement with AML.
In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.
The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.
The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager (including AML) should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.
The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.
In addition, the Collateral Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described herein under “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.
The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.
The Issuer has entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement with the Collateral Manager and Barclays Bank PLC. Under the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement (i) the Collateral Manager will select certain Collateral Obligations in the primary and/or secondary markets to be purchased by Barclays Bank PLC, (ii) Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to sell to the Issuer, with full title guarantee, all of its rights, title, interest, obligations and benefit in and to each such Collateral Obligation on the Issue Date and (iii) the Issuer has undertaken to purchase from Barclays Bank PLC such Collateral Obligations on the Issue Date.
4.27 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing
The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.
4.28 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Refinancing Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to (i) redeem the Refinanced Notes at their respective aggregate Redemption Prices, (ii) pay certain Administrative Expenses (including Refinancing Costs) and/or Trustee Fees and Expenses (including Refinancing Costs), as applicable, in accordance with the Conditions, (iii) pay certain other amounts in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and (iv) to be transferred to the Principal Account to be applied, among other things, toward the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations (including the) Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations). The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.
Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.
In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
4.29 Valuation Information; Limited Information
None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee and Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.
5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates

The scope of the activities of the Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited and the funds and clients managed or advised by Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may invest, on behalf of themselves and their clients, in obligations and/or securities that would be appropriate as Collateral Obligations, as well as in obligations and/or securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations that are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may give advice or take action for their own account or their other client accounts with similar strategies which may differ from action taken for the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also have ongoing relationships with companies whose obligations and/or securities are Collateral Obligations, and may own, directly or through other funds or accounts that they manage, loans, equity or debt securities issued by obligors of Collateral Obligations or other Collateral. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may have provided and may provide in the future certain services (including advisory services) for a negotiated fee to companies whose obligations or other securities are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel may invest, or have already invested, in obligations and/or other securities that are identical to or senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, on behalf of themselves or their clients, may also be active on steering committees of creditors in the restructuring of debt obligations issued by companies whose loans or securities are owned by them or their clients, including the Issuer, which relationships could give rise to multiple conflicts of interest. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may serve as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager of partnerships or companies organised to issue collateralised bond or loan obligations secured by noninvestment grade bank loans. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates may at certain times be engaged in seeking to purchase or dispose of, or may have already purchased or disposed of, investments for the Issuer while at the same time the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates is also seeking to purchase or dispose of, or has already purchased or disposed of, similar or identical investments for its own account or clients or Affiliates or another entity for which it or an Affiliate serves as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager. By reason of the various activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and such Affiliates may acquire or otherwise come into possession of confidential or material non-public information or be restricted from effecting transactions in certain Collateral Obligations or other Collateral that otherwise might have been initiated or prevented from liquidating a position. Such information might also not be known to the personnel of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited responsible for monitoring the Collateral Obligations or other Collateral and performing the other obligations of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral
Management and Administration Agreement. At times, the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited, in an effort to avoid restrictions for the Issuer and its and its Affiliates’ other clients, may elect not to receive, or actively avoid exposure to, information that other market participants or counterparties are eligible to receive or have received.
Many of the investment opportunities that Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited evaluate for potential investment by their clients or funds may be eligible investments for more than one such client or fund. Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”) and its Affiliates expect to allocate such investment opportunities generally based on factors and other considerations as Ares Management determines in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to: (i) differences with respect to available capital, size, and remaining life of a fund; (ii) different investment objectives or strategies;
(iii) differences in risk profile at the time the opportunity becomes available; (iv) the potential transaction and other costs of allocating an opportunity among various funds; (v) potential conflicts of interest, including whether a fund has an existing investment in the issuer in question; (vi) the nature of the security or the transaction including minimum investment amounts and the source of the opportunity;
(vii) current and anticipated market conditions; and (viii) differences in particular portfolio profile covenants or other contractual requirements, including requirements set forth in debt agreements of funds utilising leverage.
Neither the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited nor any of their Affiliates have any affirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before offering any investments to other funds, accounts or portfolios (including, without limitation, any collateralised loan obligation transaction) that the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited or any of their Affiliates manage or advise. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also make investments on their own behalf without effecting such investment opportunities on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may be bound by affirmative obligations at present or in the future, whereby it or they are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager Ares Management Limited or their Affiliates effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Alternatively, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise simultaneously with or in addition to effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Thus, other funds, accounts or portfolios that it or they manage or advise could become co-investors with the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager will endeavour to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities in a manner which it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances. Further, the Collateral Manager will be prohibited under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from directing the acquisition of Collateral Obligations from, or disposition of Collateral Obligations to, its Affiliates or any other account managed by the Collateral Manager except in a transaction conducted on an arm’s-length basis.
Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited currently serve as the portfolio managers for a number of collateralised loan obligation transactions secured by collateral consisting primarily of non-investment grade secured bank loans. The professional staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may also provide services to such Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited. Although the professional staff of the Collateral Manager and AML will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited deem appropriate to perform its duties in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s (and Ares Management Limited’s) other accounts and the accounts of the Collateral Manager’s Affiliates. The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, aggregate orders for its accounts under management (or for the accounts of its Affiliates). Depending upon market conditions, the aggregation of orders may result in a higher or lower average price paid or received by a client. There is no assurance that the Issuer will hold the same assets as, or perform in a similar manner to, any other collateralised loan obligation or other client with strategies or investment objectives similar to the Issuer.
The Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may, in one or more transactions, effect client cross-transactions where the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and another collateralised loan obligation, fund or account managed or advised by it or one or more of its Affiliates, but neither it nor the Affiliate will receive any commission
or similar fee in connection with such cross-transaction. In connection with any such acquisition or sale, the Collateral Obligations will be valued and bought or sold for a price based on a price that is equal to the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. Each of the acquisitions or sales described in this paragraph will be effected in accordance with, as applicable, the terms of the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and applicable law, including, without limitation, the applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”) that govern such transactions.
In addition, with the prior authorisation of the Issuer, which may be revoked at any time, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of its Affiliates acts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law. The Collateral Manager may also effect principal transactions between itself or its Affiliates and the Issuer.
Any transaction effected between the Issuer and the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates on a principal, client cross or agency cross basis will be conducted at arm’s length for fair market value and on terms as favourable to the Issuer as would be the case in a transaction with an independent third party and in accordance with any fiduciary obligation of the Collateral Manager under applicable law.
On each Payment Date, the Collateral Manager will be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priorities of Payment if the Subordinated Noteholders have received the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold as of such Payment Date. See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The manner in which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is determined could create an incentive for the Collateral Manager to make riskier investments in the Collateral Obligations than the Issuer would otherwise make in order to increase the likelihood that the Subordinated Noteholders receive the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold for the Collateral Manager to be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee.
The Collateral Manager may enter into, amend or terminate side letters or other similar agreements to or with one or more Noteholders or prospective Noteholders which have the effect of altering or supplementing terms described in this Offering Circular as they pertain to the Collateral Manager or of establishing rights not described therein with respect to a Noteholder that has entered into such side letters or other written agreements or instruments vis à vis the Collateral Manager, including, without limitation, varying fee structures and allowing for varying arrangements with respect to the scope and frequency of information provided about the Portfolio. Unless specifically negotiated, other Noteholders will not have the right to review (or to receive the economic or other benefits of) any such side letters.
The Collateral Manager will purchase the Retention Notes on the Issue Date and the Collateral Manager may purchase other Notes on or after the Issue Date. Any Rated Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may only be held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes. Subject to the foregoing, there will be no restriction on the ability of the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any of their respective Affiliates or employees to purchase the Notes, either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers, and to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled. The purchase of Notes by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may create potential and/or actual conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and other investors in the Notes. Such purchases may be in the secondary market and may occur a significant amount of time after the Issue Date. Resulting conflicts of interest could include (a) divergent economic interests between the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and other investors in the Notes, on the other hand, and (b) voting of Notes by the Collateral Manager, or a recommendation to vote by the same, to cause, among other things, an early redemption of the Notes and/or an amendment of the transaction documents relating to the Notes.
The Collateral Manager has notified the Issuer that it holds on the Issue Date, and intends to continue to hold on an ongoing basis until the Maturity Date, Subordinated Notes with an original Principal Amount Outstanding (such original Principal Amount Outstanding calculated as of the date of issuance of such Subordinated Notes including the date of any issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) multiplied by the price at which such Subordinated Notes were purchased by the Retention Holder equal to or greater than 5 per cent. of the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount on the relevant date of determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements are repealed or modified, the Collateral Manager may dispose of all or any portion of the
Subordinated Notes it purchased on the Original Issue Date or thereafter, provided the Collateral Manager continues to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements to the extent that such EU Retention and Transparency Requirements apply to the Collateral Manager or the transaction.
The Notes may also be purchased (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) by investment funds or other accounts for which the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, and/or their Affiliates serve as collateral manager or investment advisor and/or for which Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited are the beneficial owner and there may be no limit on the exercise by such funds or accounts of any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled, and such voting rights may be exercised in a manner adverse to some or all of the other holders of Notes.
The Collateral Manager will discuss the composition of the Collateral Obligations and other matters relating to the transaction contemplated hereby with any Collateral Manager Related Person that is a Subordinated Noteholder and may have such discussions with other beneficial owners of Notes or stakeholders in the Issuer. There can be no assurance that such discussions will not influence the actions or inactions of the Collateral Manager in the conduct of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement are owed solely to the Issuer (and, to the extent of the Issuer’s collateral assignment of its rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trustee). The Collateral Manager is not in contractual privity with, and owes no separate duties or obligations to, any of the holders of the Notes and the Subordinated Noteholders. Actions taken by the Collateral Manager may differentially affect the interests of the various Classes of Notes (whose holders may themselves have different interests), and except as provided in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement the Collateral Manager has no obligation to consider such differential effects or different interests.
In addition, upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). If the Collateral Manager resigns, or is removed, the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor by delivering notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. The Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may, within 30 days from receipt of such notice, object to such Eligible Successor by delivery of notice of such objection to the Issuer and the Trustee. If the Controlling Class object as described in the previous sentence, then the Controlling Class, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, shall propose an alternative replacement collateral manager which shall be appointed a successor provided the holders of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution) do not object within 30 days after having been given notice thereof. If no such Eligible Successor has been appointed and approved within 90 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor. If (i) such successor Collateral Manager agrees in writing to assume all of the Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and (ii) the Issuer has not received written objections from the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) within 45 days of such proposal, the Issuer will appoint such proposed Eligible Successor upon the expiration of such 45 day period. If no Eligible Successor has been appointed within 135 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor without any approval or veto right of any Noteholder (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment).
Accordingly, there is a risk to Noteholders that the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may take (or fail to take) action with respect to the appointment of a successor that is adverse to such Noteholders and that, if the Controlling Class fails to act (by way of Ordinary Resolution), the Collateral Manager could delay its removal for a significant period of time and obstruct the appointment of a successor following a vote to effect its replacement by voting against any successor and refusing to petition a court when no replacement is found.
The Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from one or more funds managed by an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited. By purchasing any Notes, each investor therein will be deemed to have acknowledged, ratified and consented for the benefit of each of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and the Initial Purchaser (i) to any such acquisition by the Issuer, (ii) to an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited having acted as investment manager or adviser to any such seller, (iii) to any related conflicts of interest with respect to the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited in connection with any such acquisition and (iv) that the acknowledgments, ratifications and consents of the initial Noteholders given on the Issue Date for the benefit of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Initial Purchaser will be binding on all Noteholders, including future Noteholders.
Rating Agencies

S&P and Moody’s have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates

Barclays Bank PLC and its Affiliates (the “Barclays Parties”) will play various roles in relation to the offering, including acting as the structurer of the transaction and in other roles described below.
The Barclays Parties have been involved (together with the Collateral Manager) in the formulation of the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Priorities of Payments and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. These may have been influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Refinancing Notes or any particular Class of Refinancing Notes.
The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Refinancing Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Refinancing Notes. The Initial Purchaser may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Refinancing Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Refinancing Notes and hedging transactions). The Initial Purchaser expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.
The Barclays Parties are part of a global investment banking and securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers in the ordinary course of their business. The financial services that the Barclays Parties may provide also include financing and, as such, the Barclays Parties may have and/or may provide financing to Collateral Manager Related Persons and/or their respective Affiliates. In addition, the Barclays Parties may derive fees and other revenues from the arrangement and provision of such financings. In the case of any such financing, the Barclays Parties may have received security over assets of a Collateral Manager Related Person and/or their respective Affiliates resulting in the Barclays Parties having enforcement rights and remedies. In carrying out its obligations as Initial Purchaser or any other transaction party, no Barclays Party shall be under any duty to disclose to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Noteholders, prospective investor or any other person, any non-public information acquired in the course of carrying on any business for, or in connection with, the provision of services to any other party. The Barclays Parties may have positions in and may have placed or underwritten certain of the Collateral Obligations (or other obligations of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations) when they were originally issued and may have provided or may be providing investment banking services and other services to Obligors of certain Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Barclays Parties and their clients may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, Collateral Obligations. Each of the Barclays Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party. Moreover, the Issuer may invest in loans of Obligors Affiliated with the Barclays Parties or in which one or more Barclays Parties hold an equity, participation
or other interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Barclays Parties’ own investments in such Obligors.
From time to time, the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Barclays Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Barclays Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to Participation Agreements and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Barclays Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Refinancing Notes.
A significant portion of the Collateral Obligations as at the Issue Date were acquired from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement.
The Barclays Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Barclays Parties and employees or customers of the Barclays Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Exchanged Securities, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions to refinance the Notes, Collateral Obligations, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Exchanged Securities, and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Barclays Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Barclays Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Refinancing Notes. The price at which a Barclays Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.
By purchasing a Refinancing Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.
6. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.
Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.
The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Noteholder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. See “Forced Transfer” above.

(a) Form and Denomination
The Notes of each Class will be issued in (i) global, certificated, fully registered form, without interest coupons, talons and principal receipts attached or (ii) definitive, certificated, fully registered form, without interest coupons, talons and principal receipts attached, in the applicable Minimum Denomination and integral multiples of any Authorised Integral Amount in excess thereof.

Each Definitive Certificate will be numbered serially with an identifying number which will be recorded in the Register which the Issuer shall procure to be kept by the Registrar. The Register (and any entire counterpart thereof) shall at all times be kept and maintained outside the United Kingdom.
(b) Title to the Registered Notes
Title to the Notes passes upon registration of transfers in the Register in accordance with the provisions of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the Trust Deed. Notes will be transferable only on the books of the Issuer and its agents. The registered holder of any Note will (except as otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of
any notice of ownership, trust or any interest in it, any writing on it, or its theft or loss) and no person will be liable for so treating the holder.
(c) Transfer
In respect of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate, one or more Notes may be transferred in whole or in part in nominal amounts of the applicable Authorised Denomination only upon the surrender, at the specified office of the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, of the Definitive Certificate representing such Note(s) to be transferred, with the form of transfer endorsed on such Definitive Certificate duly completed and executed and together with such other evidence as the Registrar or Transfer Agent may reasonably require. In the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of Notes represented by one Definitive Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a further new Definitive Certificate in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred will be issued to the transferor. Interests in a Global Certificate will be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of the relevant Clearing System.
(d) Delivery of New Certificates
Each new Definitive Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(c) (Transfer) will be available for delivery within five Business Days of receipt of such form of transfer or of surrender of an existing certificate upon partial redemption. Delivery of new Definitive Certificate(s) shall be made at the specified office of the Transfer Agent or of the Registrar, as the case may be, to whom delivery or surrender shall have been made or, at the option of the holder making such delivery or surrender as aforesaid and as specified in the form of transfer or otherwise in writing, shall be sent by courier, at the risk of the holder entitled to the new Definitive Certificate, to such address as may be so specified. In this Condition 2(d) (Delivery of New Certificates), “Business Day“ means a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks are open for business in the place of the specified offices of the Transfer Agent and the Registrar.
(e) Transfer Free of Charge
Transfer of Notes and Global Certificates or Definitive Certificates (as applicable) representing such Notes in accordance with these Conditions on registration or transfer will be effected without charge to the Noteholders by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, but upon payment (or the giving of such indemnity as the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may require in respect thereof) of any tax or other governmental charges which may be imposed in relation to it.
(f) Closed Periods
No Noteholder may require the transfer of a Note to be registered (i) during the period of 15 calendar days ending on the due date for redemption (in full) of that Note or (ii) during the period of seven calendar days ending on (and including) any Record Date.
(g) Regulations Concerning Transfer and Registration
All transfers of Notes and entries on the Register will be made subject to the detailed regulations concerning the transfer of Notes scheduled to the Trust Deed, including without limitation, that a transfer of Notes in breach of certain of such regulations will result in such transfer being void ab initio. The regulations may be changed by the Issuer in any manner which is reasonably required by the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee) to reflect changes in legal or regulatory requirements or in any other manner which, in the opinion of the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee and subject to not less than 60 days’ notice of any such change having been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)), is not prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the relevant Class of Notes. A copy of the current regulations may be inspected at the offices of the Transfer Agent during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for the term of the Notes and will be sent by the Registrar to any Noteholder who so requests.
(h) Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes
If the Issuer determines at any time that a holder of Rule 144A Notes is a U.S. Person and is not a QIB/QP (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”), the Issuer shall promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder
demanding that such holder transfer its Notes outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or within the United States to a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such holder fails to effect the transfer of its Rule 144A Notes within such period, (a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer shall cause such Rule 144A Notes to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such Rule 144A Notes. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Rule 144A Notes and selling such Rule 144A Notes to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion. Each Noteholder and each other person in the chain of title from the permitted Noteholder to the Non-Permitted Noteholder by its acceptance of an interest in the Rule 144A Notes agrees to co-operate with the Issuer to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the selling Noteholder. The terms and conditions of any sale hereunder shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, subject to the transfer restrictions set out herein, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion. The Issuer reserves the right to require any holder of Notes to submit a written certification substantiating that it is a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. If such holder fails to submit any such requested written certification on a timely basis, the Issuer has the right to assume that the holder of the Notes from whom such a certification is requested is not a QIB/QP or a non-U.S. Person. Furthermore, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse to honour a transfer of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Note to any Person who is not either a non-U.S. Person or a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP.
(i) Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA
If any Noteholder has made, as applicable, a representation or deemed representation required hereby regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person, or regarding the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or provisions of Similar Law or Other Plan Law (in each case, as applicable), and the Issuer has subsequently determined that (i) the representation or deemed representation is false or misleading, or (ii) that the Noteholder is a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person whose beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent limitation set out in the Plan Asset Regulation (any such Noteholder a “Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder”), the Non- Permitted ERISA Noteholder may be required by the Issuer to sell or otherwise transfer its Notes to an eligible purchaser (selected by the Issuer) at a price to be agreed between the Issuer (exercising its sole discretion) and such eligible purchaser at the time of sale, subject to the transfer restrictions set out in the Trust Deed. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer to the extent required to effect such transfers. None of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Registrar shall be liable to any Noteholder having an interest in the Notes sold or otherwise transferred as a result of any such sale or transfer. The Issuer shall be entitled to deduct from the sale or transfer price an amount equal to all the expenses, taxes and costs incurred and any loss suffered by the Issuer as a result of such forced transfer. The Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder will receive the balance, if any.
(j) Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA
Each Noteholder (which, for the purposes of this Condition 2(j) (Forced transfer pursuant to FATCA) may include a nominee or beneficial owner of a Note) will agree to provide the Issuer and its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and/or the CRS and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer. In the event the Noteholder fails to provide such information or documentation for the purposes of FATCA, or to the extent that its ownership of the Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer and its agents are authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder as compensation for any taxes to which the Issuer is subject under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Noteholder’s ownership of Notes, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer, the Issuer will have the right to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any costs, charges, and any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Noteholder
as payment in full for such Notes. The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate CUSIP, ISIN, and/or similar identifier in the Issuer’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have the right to sell a beneficial owner’s interest in a Note in its entirety notwithstanding that the sale of a portion of such an interest would permit the Issuer to comply with FATCA.
(k) Forced Transfer mechanics
In order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer may repay any affected Notes and issue replacement Notes and the Issuer, the Trustee and the Agents (each at the expense of the Issuer) shall work with the Clearing Systems to take such action as may be necessary to effect such repayment and issue of replacement Notes.
Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, authorises the Trustee, the Agents and the Clearing Systems to take such action as may be necessary to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) without the need for further express instruction from any affected Noteholder. Each Noteholder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Noteholder, by its acceptance of an interest in such Notes, agrees that it shall be bound by any such action taken by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents and the Clearing Systems.
(l) Registrar authorisation
The Noteholders hereby authorise the Registrar and the Clearing Systems to take such actions as are necessary in order to effect the forced transfer provisions set out in Conditions 2(h) (Forced Transfer of Rule 144A Notes), 2(i) (Forced Transfer pursuant to ERISA) and 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA) above without the need for any further express instruction from any affected Noteholder. The Noteholders shall be bound by any actions taken by the Registrar, the Clearing Systems or any other party taken pursuant to the above-named Conditions.

(ii) CM Voting Notes shall carry a right to vote in respect of, and be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Replacement Resolution and any CM Removal Resolution. CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and CM Non-Voting Notes shall not carry any rights in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on, any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution but shall carry a right to vote on and be counted in respect of all other matters in respect of which the CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted.

CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes shall be exchangeable (a) upon request by the relevant Noteholder at any time into CM Non- Voting Notes or (b) into CM Voting Notes only in connection with the transfer of such Notes to an entity that is not an Affiliate of the transferor upon request of the relevant transferee or transferor and in no other circumstance. CM Non-Voting Notes shall not be exchangeable at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.
(iv) Any such right to exchange a Note, as described and subject to the limitations set out in the immediately prior paragraph, may be exercised by a Noteholder holding a Definitive Certificate or a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate delivering to the Registrar or a Transfer Agent a duly completed exchange request substantially in the form provided in the Trust Deed.

(iv) Reinvestment Amounts
At any time during the Reinvestment Period, any holder of Subordinated Notes may notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager that it proposes to:
(A) make a cash contribution to the Issuer;
(B) designate as a contribution to the Issuer all or a specified portion of Interest Proceeds and/or Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be distributed on a Payment Date to such holder pursuant to paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments or paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments, provided that the relevant Subordinated Notes are held in the form of Definitive Certificates or the procedures of the clearing systems can facilitate such designation; or
(C) subscribe for additional Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to Condition 17(b) (Additional Issuances), as applicable. Any such proposed Reinvestment Amount is subject to the condition that:
(1) no more than a total of three Reinvestment Amounts may be effected in aggregate in respect of all Subordinated Notes held by such Subordinated Noteholder;
(2) each Reinvestment Amount is in an amount no less than Euro 1,000,000; and
(3) the Class E Par Value Test is satisfied immediately following such proposed Reinvestment Amount being accepted by the Collateral Manager.
The Collateral Manager, in consultation with such holder (but in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion), will determine (A) whether to accept any proposed Reinvestment Amount and (B) the Permitted Use to which such proposed Reinvestment Amount would be applied. The Collateral Manager will provide written notice of such determination to the applicable Reinvesting Noteholder(s) thereof and such Reinvestment Amount will be accepted by the Issuer. If such Reinvestment Amount is accepted by the Collateral Manager, it will be deposited by the Issuer into the Supplemental Reserve Account and applied to a Permitted Use determined by the Collateral Manager. Amounts deposited pursuant to sub-paragraph (ii) above will be deemed to constitute payment of the amounts designated thereunder for purposes of all distributions from the Payment Account to be made on such Payment Date. Any amount so deposited shall not earn interest and shall not increase the principal balance of the Subordinated Notes held by such holder. Unless retained as directed by the applicable Reinvesting Noteholder, Reinvestment Amounts will be paid to the applicable Reinvesting Noteholder on the first subsequent Payment Date on which Principal Proceeds are available therefor as provided in paragraph (S) of the Principal Priority of Payments or on which Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds are available therefor as provided in the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. Any request of any Reinvesting Noteholder under sub-paragraph (ii) above shall specify the percentage(s) of the amount(s) that such Reinvesting Noteholder is entitled to receive on the applicable Payment Date in respect of distributions pursuant to paragraphs (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments or paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments, as applicable (such Reinvesting Noteholder’s “Distribution Amount”) that such Reinvesting Noteholder wishes the Issuer to deposit in the Supplemental Reserve Account. The Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer will provide each such Reinvesting Noteholder with an estimate of such Reinvesting Noteholder’s Distribution Amount not later than two Business Days prior to any subsequent Payment Date.
(d) Non payment of Amounts
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts on the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payment by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not be a Note Event of Default unless and until such failure continues for a period of five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission as described in Condition 10(a)(i) (Non Payment of Interest), save in each case as the result of any deduction therefrom or the imposition of withholding thereon as set forth in Condition 9 (Taxation).
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay the Interest Amounts on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) in accordance with the Priorities of Payment by reason solely that there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Payment Account shall not constitute a Note Event of Default, but instead will constitute Deferred Interest pursuant to Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) unless a Frequency Switch Event has occurred and such Class is the senior most Class of Notes Outstanding.
Non-payment of amounts due and payable on the Subordinated Notes as a result of the insufficiency of available Interest Proceeds will not constitute a Note Event of Default.
Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay any principal when the same becomes due and payable on any Rated Note on the Maturity Date or any Redemption Date shall be a Note Event of Default provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission and provided further that, failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Conditions or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails, will not constitute a Note Event of Default.
Subject always, in the case of Interest Amounts payable in respect of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6(c) (Deferral of Interest) and save as otherwise provided in respect of any unpaid Collateral Management Fees (and VAT payable in respect thereof) or Reinvestment Amounts to Reinvesting Noteholders, in the event of non payment of any amounts referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments or the Principal Priority of Payments on any Payment Date, such amounts shall remain due and shall be payable on each subsequent Payment Date in the orders of priority provided for in this Condition 3 (Status). References to the amounts referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments and the Principal Priority of Payments of this Condition 3 (Status) shall include any amounts thereof not paid when due in accordance with this Condition 3 (Status) on any preceding Payment Date.
(e) Determination and Payment of Amounts
The Collateral Administrator will, in consultation with the Collateral Manager, on the Business Day immediately following each Determination Date, calculate the amounts payable on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment and will notify the Issuer and the Trustee of such amounts. The Account Bank (acting in accordance with the Payment Date Report compiled by the Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) shall, on behalf of the Issuer not later than 4.00pm (London time) on the Business Day preceding each Payment Date, cause the amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account and if applicable the Interest Account and the Supplemental Reserve Account (together with, to the extent applicable, amounts standing to the credit of any other Account) to the extent required to pay the amounts referred to in the Interest Priority of Payments and the Principal Priority of Payments which are payable on such Payment Date to be transferred to the Payment Account in accordance with Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts).
(f) De Minimis Amounts
The Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer may, in consultation with the Collateral Manager, adjust the amounts required to be applied in payment of principal on the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes from time to time pursuant to the Priorities of Payment so that the amount to be so applied in respect of each Class X Note, Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note, Class D Note and the Subordinated Notes is a whole amount, not involving any fraction of a 0.01 Euro or, at the discretion of the Collateral Administrator, part of a Euro.

The Collateral Administrator on behalf of the Issuer will cause details of the amounts of interest and principal to be paid, and any amounts of interest payable but not paid, on each Payment Date in respect of the Notes to be notified at the expense of the Issuer to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar and Euronext Dublin by no later than 11.00 am (London time) on the Business Day prior to the applicable Payment Date in the Payment Date Report.

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Subscription Agreement (together with the obligations owed by the Issuer to the other Secured Parties) are secured in favour of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties by:

(iii) a first fixed charge over all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of each of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s)) and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of such Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s)) and the debts represented thereby and including, without limitation, all interest accrued and other moneys received in respect thereof;
(iv) a first fixed charge and first priority security interest (where the applicable assets are securities) over, or an assignment by way of security (where the applicable rights are contractual obligations) of, all present and future rights of the Issuer in respect of any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account, including, without limitation, all moneys received in respect thereof, all dividends and distributions paid or payable thereon, all property paid, distributed, accruing or offered at any time on, to or in respect of or in substitution therefor and the proceeds of sale, repayment and redemption thereof and over the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and all moneys from time to time standing to the credit of the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and the debts represented thereby and including, without limitation, all interest accrued and other moneys received in respect thereof, subject, in each case, to the rights of any Hedge Counterparty to Counterparty Downgrade Collateral pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) and any first priority security interest granted by the Issuer to any Hedge Counterparty;
(v) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights against the Custodian under the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (to the extent each relates to the Custody Account)

(vi) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under each Hedge Agreement and each Hedge Transaction entered into thereunder (including the Issuer’s rights under any guarantee or credit support annex entered into pursuant to any Hedge Agreement, provided that such assignment by way of security is without prejudice to, and after giving effect to, any contractual netting or set-off provision contained in the relevant Hedge Agreement and shall not in any way restrict the release of collateral granted thereunder in whole or in part at any time pursuant to the terms thereof);
(vii) a first fixed charge over all moneys held from time to time by the Principal Paying Agent and any other Agent for payment of principal, interest or other amounts on the Notes (if any);
(viii) an assignment by way of security of all the Issuer’s present and future rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, each Collateral Acquisition Agreement, each other Transaction Document and each Reporting Delegation Agreement, and, in each case, all sums derived therefrom; and
(ix) a floating charge over the whole of the Issuer’s undertaking and assets to the extent that such undertaking and assets are not subject to any other security created pursuant to the Trust Deed,

The security created pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (ix) above is granted to the Trustee for itself and as trustee for the Secured Parties as continuing security for the payment of the Secured Obligations provided that the security granted by the Issuer over any collateral provided to the Issuer pursuant to a Hedge Agreement will only be available to the Secured Parties (other than with respect to the collateral provided to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to such Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts)) when such collateral is expressed to be available to the Issuer and (if a title transfer arrangement) to the extent that no equivalent amount is owed to the Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the relevant Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The security will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Issuer in respect of the above, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
If, for any reason, the purported assignment by way of security of, and/or the grant of first fixed charges over, the property, assets, rights and/or benefits described above is found to be ineffective in respect of any such property, assets, rights and/or benefits (together, the “Affected Collateral”), the Issuer shall hold to the fullest extent permitted under Dutch or any other mandatory law the benefit of the Affected Collateral and any sums received in respect thereof or any security interest, guarantee or indemnity or undertaking of whatever nature given to secure such Affected Collateral (together, the “Trust Collateral”) on trust for the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall (i) account to the Trustee for or otherwise apply all sums received in respect of such Trust Collateral as the Trustee may direct (provided that, subject to the Conditions and the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, if no Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall be entitled to apply the benefit of such Trust Collateral and such sums in respect of such Trust Collateral received by it and held on trust under this paragraph without prior direction from the Trustee), (ii) exercise any rights it may have in respect of the Trust Collateral at the direction of the Trustee and (iii) at its own cost take such action and execute such documents as the Trustee may in its sole discretion require.
The Issuer may from time to time grant security:
(A) by way of a first priority security interest to a Hedge Counterparty over a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account and any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral deposited by such Hedge Counterparty in the relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account as security for the Issuer’s obligations to make any payment and/or delivery to the relevant Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement and Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) (subject to such security documentation as may be agreed between such third party, the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer and the Trustee); and/or
(B) by way of first priority security interest over amounts representing all or part of the Unfunded Amount of any Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation and deposited in its name with a third party as security for any reimbursement or indemnification obligation of the Issuer owed to any other lender under such Revolving Obligation or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, subject to the terms of Condition 3(j)(vi) (The Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account) (including Rating Agency Confirmation).
in each case, excluding (A) any and all assets, property or rights which are located in, or governed by the laws of, The Netherlands (except for contractual rights or receivables (rechten of vorderingen op naam)) which are assigned or charged to the Trustee pursuant to Condition 4(a)(i) to (ix) (Security) above); (B) all Dutch Ineligible Securities; (C) the Issuer’s rights under the Issuer Management Agreement; and (D) the Issuer’s rights in respect of amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Dutch Account from time to time.
All deeds, documents, assignments, instruments, bonds, notes, negotiable instruments, papers and any other instruments comprising, evidencing, representing and/or transferring the Portfolio will be deposited with or held by or on behalf of the Custodian until the security over such obligations is irrevocably discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed. In the event that the ratings of the Custodian are downgraded to below the Rating Requirement or withdrawn, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that a replacement Custodian with the Rating Requirement is appointed on substantially the same terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed, the Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft or reduction in value of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure the Collateral and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held in a clearing system or in safe custody by the Custodian, a bank or other custodian. The Trustee has no responsibility for ensuring that the Custodian, the Account Bank or any Hedge Counterparty satisfies the Rating Requirement applicable to it or, in the event of its failure to satisfy such Rating Requirement, to procure the appointment of a replacement custodian, account bank or hedge counterparty. The Trustee has no responsibility for the management of the Portfolio by the Collateral Manager or to supervise the administration of the Portfolio by the Collateral Administrator or by any other party and is entitled to rely on the certificates or notices of any relevant party without further enquiry or liability. The Trust Deed also provides that the Trustee shall accept without investigation, requisition or objection such right, benefit, title and interest, if any, as the Issuer may have in and to any of the Collateral and is not bound to make any investigation into the same or into the Collateral in any respect.
(b) Application of Proceeds upon Enforcement
The Trust Deed provides that the net proceeds of realisation of or enforcement with respect to the security over the Collateral constituted by the Trust Deed shall be applied in accordance with the priorities of payment set out in Condition 11 (Enforcement).
(c) Limited Recourse and Non-Petition
The obligations of the Issuer to pay amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties at any time shall be limited to the proceeds available at such time to make such payments in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Conditions or any other Transaction Document, if the net proceeds of realisation of the security constituted by the Trust Deed, upon enforcement thereof in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) and the provisions of the Trust Deed or otherwise are less than the aggregate amount payable in such
circumstances by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and to the other Secured Parties (such negative amount being referred to herein as a “shortfall”), the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of each Class and its obligations to the other Secured Parties and in such circumstances will be limited to such net proceeds, which shall be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. In such circumstances, the other assets (including amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer Dutch Account and its rights under the Issuer Management Agreement) of the Issuer will not be available for payment of such shortfall which shall be borne by the Class X Noteholders, the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Reinvesting Noteholders (if any), the Subordinated Noteholders and the other Secured Parties in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (applied in reverse order). In such circumstances the rights of the Secured Parties to receive any further amounts in respect of such obligations shall be extinguished and none of the Noteholders of each Class or the other Secured Parties may take any further action to recover such amounts. None of the Noteholders of any Class, the Trustee, the other Secured Parties (or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes of any Class, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Secured Parties, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which is initiated by another non-Affiliated party or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer and without limitation to the Trustee’s right to enforce and/or realise the security constituted by the Trust Deed (including by appointing a receiver or an administrative receiver).
In addition, none of the Noteholders or any of the other Secured Parties shall have any recourse against any director, shareholder or officer of the Issuer in respect of any obligations, covenants or agreements entered into or made by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of these Conditions or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party or any notice or documents which it is requested to deliver hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Trustee, the Managing Directors, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager and any Agent has any obligation to any Noteholder of any Class for payment of any amount by the Issuer in respect of the Notes of any Class.
(d) Exercise of Rights in Respect of the Portfolio
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer authorises the Collateral Manager, prior to enforcement of the security over the Collateral, to exercise all rights and remedies of the Issuer in its capacity as a holder of, or person beneficially entitled to, the Portfolio. In particular, the Collateral Manager is authorised, subject to any specific direction given by the Issuer, to attend and vote at any meeting of holders of, or other persons interested or participating in, or entitled to the rights or benefits (or a part thereof) under, the Portfolio and to give any consent, waiver, indulgence, time or notification, make any declaration or agree any composition, compounding or other similar arrangement with respect to any obligations forming part of the Portfolio.
(e) Information Regarding the Collateral
The Issuer shall procure that a copy of each Monthly Report and any Payment Date Report is made available, within two Business Days of publication, to each Noteholder of each Class upon request in writing therefor and that copies of each such Report are made available to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and each Rating Agency within two Business Days of publication thereof.
(f) Securitisation Regulation
The Issuer hereby agrees to be designated as the entity required to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer will assume all costs of complying with the reporting requirements under Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (including the properly incurred costs and expenses (including legal fees) of all parties incurred amending the Transaction Documents for this purpose) and, if applicable, shall reimburse each of the Collateral Manager and/or the Collateral Administrator for any such costs incurred by the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Administrator in connection with their assisting the Issuer with the preparation and/or filing
of such information and reports required pursuant to the provisions of the Securitisation Regulation, such costs to be paid as Administrative Expenses or Trustee Fees and Expenses, as applicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, and following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer in making available such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for the use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
In connection with such information and reporting, the Collateral Manager will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders, and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.

6. Interest
(a) Payment Dates
(i) Rated Notes
The Rated Notes each bear interest from (and including) the Issue Date and such interest will be payable (A) in the case of interest accrued during the initial Accrual Period, for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Payment Date falling in 17 January 2020, (B) in respect of each six month Accrual Period, semi-annually and (C) in respect of each three month Accrual Period, quarterly, in each case in arrear on each Payment Date.
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Interest shall be payable on the Subordinated Notes to the extent funds are available in accordance with paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments, paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments and paragraph (W) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments on each Payment Date or other relevant payment date and shall continue to be payable in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) notwithstanding redemption in full of any Subordinated Note at its applicable Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the Trust Deed, all references herein and therein to the Subordinated Notes being redeemed in full or at their Principal Amount Outstanding shall be deemed to be amended to the extent required to ensure that a minimum of €1 principal amount of each such Class of Notes remains Outstanding at all times and any amounts which are to be applied in redemption of each such Class of Notes pursuant hereto which are in excess of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof minus €1 shall constitute interest payable in respect of such Notes and shall not be applied in redemption of the Principal Amount Outstanding thereof, provided always however that such €1 principal shall no longer remain Outstanding and each such Class of Notes shall be redeemed in full on the date on which all of the Collateral securing the Notes has been realised and is to be finally distributed to the Noteholders.
If the aggregate of income and gains earned by the Issuer during an accounting period exceeds the costs and expenses accrued for that period, such excess shall accrue as additional interest on the
Subordinated Notes but shall only be payable on any Payment Date or other payment date following payment in full of amounts payable pursuant to the Priorities of Payment on such Payment Date or other payment date.
(b) Interest Accrual
(i) Rated Notes
Each Rated Note (or, as the case may be, the relevant part thereof due to be redeemed) will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, it shall continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder and (B) the day following seven days after the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent has notified the Noteholders of such Class of Notes in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes of such Class up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
(ii) Subordinated Notes
Payments on the Subordinated Notes will cease to be payable in respect of each Subordinated Note upon the date that all of the Collateral has been realised and no Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral remain available for distribution in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
(c) Deferral of Interest
The Issuer shall, and shall only be obliged to, pay any Interest Amount payable in respect of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes in full on any Payment Date in each case to the extent that there are Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds available for payment thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, unless a Frequency Switch Event has occurred and such Class is the senior most Class of Notes Outstanding in accordance with Condition 10(a)(i) (Non Payment of Interest).
In the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, an amount of interest equal to any shortfall in payment of the Interest Amount not due and payable in respect of such Class in accordance with these Conditions on any Payment Date (each such amount being referred to as “Deferred Interest”) will not be payable on such Payment Date, but will be added to the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, and thereafter will accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to that Class, and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest to the holders of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, as applicable, will not be a Note Event of Default until the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Notes are to be redeemed in full.
(d) Payment of Deferred Interest
Deferred Interest in respect of any Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note shall only become payable by the Issuer in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of the Interest Priority of Payments, the Principal Priority of Payments and the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and under the Note Payment Sequence in each place specified in the Priorities of Payment, to the extent that Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, as applicable, or, where applicable, other net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral, are available to make such payment in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (and, if applicable, the Note Payment Sequence). An amount equal to any such Deferred Interest so paid shall be subtracted from the principal amount of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes, as applicable.
(e) Interest on the Rated Notes
(i) Floating Rate of Interest
The rate of interest from time to time in respect of the Class X Notes (the “Class X Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class A Notes (the “Class A Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class B Notes (the “Class B Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class C Notes (the “Class C Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class D Notes (the “Class D Rate of Interest”), in respect of the Class E Notes (the “Class E Rate of Interest”) and in respect of the Class F Notes (the “Class F Rate of Interest”) will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:
(A) On each Interest Determination Date
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, the Calculation Agent will determine a straight line interpolation of the offered rate for one and three month Euro deposits;
(2) in the case of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine (i) the offered rate for six month Euro deposits; and (ii) the offered rate for three month Euro deposits; and
(3) in the case of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, the Calculation Agent will determine the offered rate for six month Euro deposits,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question (“EURIBOR”). Such offered rate will be that which appears on the display designated on the Bloomberg Screen “BTMM EU” Page (or such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying EURIBOR rates). The Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest for each Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (as defined below) and in respect of (i) the initial Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (1) above; and (ii) each six month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (2) (i) or paragraph (3) above (as applicable); and (iii) each three month Accrual Period, the rate referred to in paragraph (2)(ii), above, in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(B) If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then paragraph (A) shall be applied, with any necessary consequential changes, to the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not so appear, or if the relevant page is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of four major banks in the Euro zone interbank market (selected by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) acting in each case through its principal Euro zone office (the “Reference Banks”) to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation to leading banks for Euro deposits in the Euro zone interbank market:
(1) in the case of the initial Accrual Period, for a straight line interpolation of the offered quotation for one month and three month Euro deposits;
(2) in respect of each Interest Determination Date, other than the initial Interest Determination Date and prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of (i) six months; and (ii) three months; and,
(3) in respect of each Interest Determination Date following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, for a period of six months,
in each case, as at 11.00 am (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest for such Accrual Period shall be the aggregate of the Applicable Margin (if any) and
the arithmetic mean, in each case, (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005 being rounded upwards)) of, in respect of (i) the initial Accrual Period; the quotations referred to in paragraph (1) above; and (ii) each six month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (2)(i) or paragraph (3) above (as applicable); and (iii) each three month Accrual Period, the quotations referred to in paragraph (2)(ii) above (or of such quotations, being at least two, as are so provided), all as determined by the Calculation Agent.
(C) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides such quotations, the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest, respectively, for the next Accrual Period shall be the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest in each case in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period; provided that in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date.
(D) Where:
“Applicable Margin” means:
(1) in the case of the Class X Notes: 0.40 per cent. per annum (the “Class X Margin”);
(2) in the case of the Class A Notes: 0.92 per cent. per annum (the “Class A Margin”);
(3) in the case of the Class B Notes: 1.60 per cent. per annum (the “Class B Margin”);
(4) in the case of the Class C Notes: 2.35 per cent. per annum (the “Class C Margin”);
(5) in the case of the Class D Notes: 3.80 per cent. per annum (the “Class D Margin”);
(6) in the case of the Class E Notes: 6.32 per cent. per annum (the “Class E Margin”); and
(7) in the case of the Class F Notes: 8.90 per cent. per annum (the “Class F Margin”).
(E) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) above, if, in relation to any Interest Determination Date, EURIBOR (or any other benchmark rate that may apply under this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest)) in respect of any Class of Rated Notes as determined in accordance with paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) above would yield a EURIBOR rate less than zero, such EURIBOR (or any other benchmark rate that may apply under this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest)) (or any other benchmark rate that may apply under this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest)) rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of determining the Rate of Interest pursuant to this Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest).
(ii) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable (and in any event (i) for each Accrual Period following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event, not later than the Business Day following the relevant Interest Determination Date; and (ii) for each Accrual Period prior to the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and for any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, not later than the Determination Date immediately preceding the relevant Payment Date), determine the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest and calculate the interest amount payable in respect of original principal amounts of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The amount of interest (an “Interest Amount”) payable in respect of each Authorised Integral Amount applicable to any such Notes shall be calculated by applying the
Class X Rate of Interest in the case of the Class X Notes, the Class A Rate of Interest in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class B Rate of Interest in the case of the Class B Notes, the Class C Rate of Interest in the case of the Class C Notes, the Class D Rate of Interest in the case of the Class D Notes, the Class E Rate of Interest in the case of the Class E Notes and the Class F Rate of Interest in the case of the Class F Notes, respectively, to an amount equal to the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of such Authorised Integral Amount, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in the Accrual Period concerned, divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest
€0.01 (€0.005 being rounded upwards).
(iii) Reference Banks and Calculation Agent
The Issuer will procure that, so long as any Class X Note, Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note remains Outstanding:
(A) a Calculation Agent shall be appointed and maintained for the purposes of determining the interest rate and interest amount payable in respect of the Notes; and
(B) in the event that the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest are to be calculated by Reference Banks pursuant to paragraph
(B) of Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest), that the number of Reference Banks required pursuant to such paragraph (B) are requested to provide a quotation.
If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the purpose of calculating interest hereunder or fails duly to establish any Rate of Interest for any Accrual Period, or to calculate the Interest Amount on any Class of Rated Notes, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the Trustee) appoint some other leading bank to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor having been so appointed.
(f) Interest Proceeds in respect of Subordinated Notes
Solely in respect of Subordinated Notes, the Collateral Administrator will as of each Determination Date calculate the Interest Proceeds payable to the extent of available funds in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto for the relevant Accrual Period. The Interest Proceeds payable on each Payment Date in respect of an original principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the Authorised Integral Amount applicable thereto shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of Interest Proceeds to be applied on the Subordinated Notes on the applicable Payment Date pursuant to paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments, paragraph
(U) of the Principal Priority of Payments and paragraph (W) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments by fractions equal to the amount of such Authorised Integral Amount, as applicable, divided by the aggregate original principal amount of the Subordinated Notes.
(g) Publication of Rates of Interest, Interest Amounts and Deferred Interest
The Calculation Agent will cause the Class X Rate of Interest, the Class A Rate of Interest, the Class B Rate of Interest, the Class C Rate of Interest, the Class D Rate of Interest, the Class E Rate of Interest and the Class F Rate of Interest or the Interest Amounts payable in respect of each Class of Rated Notes, the amount of any Deferred Interest due but not paid on any Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes for each Accrual Period and Payment Date, and following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event on any Frequency Switch Measurement Date, and the Principal Amount Outstanding of each Class of Notes as of the applicable Payment Date, to be notified to the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager, as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter, and the Principal Paying Agent shall cause each such rate, amount and date and occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event to be notified to the Noteholders of each Class in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible following notification to the Principal Paying Agent but in no event later than the third Business Day after such notification. The Interest Amounts in respect of the Rated Notes or the Payment Date in respect of any Class so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made with the consent of the Trustee by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Accrual Period. If any of the Notes become due and payable under Condition 10 (Events of Default), interest shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent
in accordance with this Condition 6 (Interest) but no publication of the applicable Interest Amounts shall be made unless the Trustee so determines.
(h) Notifications, etc. to be Final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Calculation Agent, will be binding on the Issuer, the Reference Banks, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and all Noteholders (save in the case that the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certificate the Trustee may rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) or the Trustee determines (in its sole discretion) that any such notification, opinion, determination, certificate, quotation or decisions given, expressed, made or obtained is erroneous and, if applicable, the Issuer publishes a correction in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), provided that the Trustee shall be under no obligation to monitor or investigate any such notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, quotations and decisions for such errors) and no liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders of any Class shall attach to the Reference Banks or the Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise or non exercise by them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 6(h) (Notifications, etc. to be Final).
7. Redemption and Purchase
(a) Final Redemption
Subject to Condition 6(a)(ii) (Subordinated Notes), save to the extent previously redeemed in full and cancelled, the Notes of each Class will be redeemed on the Maturity Date of such Notes at their Redemption Price in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment.

90 day period) (i) the Controlling Class or (ii) the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, may elect that the Notes of each Class are redeemed, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day thereafter, at their respective Redemption Prices in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in which case the Issuer shall so redeem the Notes on such terms, provided that such Note Tax Event would affect payment of principal or interest in respect of the Controlling Class or, as the case may be, the Subordinated Notes (in addition to any other Class of Notes) on such Payment Date; provided further that such redemption of the Notes, whether pursuant to the exercise of such option by the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, shall take place subject to and in accordance with the procedures set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Condition 7(b)(vi) (Optional Redemption effected through Liquidation only).

8. Payments

(a) Method of Payment
Payments of principal upon final redemption in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such Note at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent by wire transfer. Payments of interest on each Note and, prior to redemption
in full thereof, principal in respect of each Note, will be made by wire transfer. Upon application of the holder to the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent not less than five Business Days before the due date for any payment in respect of a Note, the payment may be made (in the case of any final payment of principal against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only of such final payment, endorsement) of such Note as provided above) by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, on the due date to a Euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in Western Europe.
Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Certificate will be made to the registered holder as shall have been notified to the relevant Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) for such purpose and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the relevant Notes, upon surrender of such Global Certificate to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent. On each occasion on which a payment of interest (unless the Notes represented thereby do not bear interest) or principal is made in respect of the relevant Global Certificate, the Registrar shall note the same in the Register and cause the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by a Global Certificate to be decreased accordingly.
(b) Payments
All payments are subject in all cases to (i) any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation) and (ii) any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to FATCA. No commission shall be charged to the Noteholders.
(c) Payments on Presentation Days
A holder shall be entitled to present a Note for payment only on a Presentation Date and shall not, except as provided in Condition 6 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a Presentation Date falls after the due date.
If a Note is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones it is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.
(d) Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agent
The names of the initial Principal Paying Agent and Transfer Agent and their initial specified offices are set out below. The Issuer reserves the right at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Principal Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent and appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will maintain a Principal Paying Agent as approved in writing by the Trustee and shall procure that it shall at all times maintain a Custodian, Account Bank, Collateral Manager and Collateral Administrator. Notice of any change in any Agent or their specified offices or in the Collateral Manager or Collateral Administrator will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
9. Taxation
All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within The Netherlands or the United States, or any other jurisdiction, or any political sub-division or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to gross up any payments made to Noteholders of any Class and shall withhold or deduct from any such payments any amounts on account of such tax where so required by law (including FATCA) or any such relevant taxing authority. Any withholding or deduction shall not constitute a Note Event of Default under Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default).
Subject as provided below, if the Issuer certifies (upon which certification the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) to the Trustee that it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes of any Class become obliged by the laws of The Netherlands to withhold or account for tax so that it would be unable to make payment of the full amount that would otherwise be due but for the imposition of such tax, the Issuer (save as provided below) shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange for the substitution
of a company incorporated in another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee as the principal obligor under the Notes of such Class, or to change its tax residence to another jurisdiction approved by the Trustee, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such change, provided that the Trustee’s approval shall be subject to confirmation of tax counsel (at the cost of the Issuer) that such a substitution and/or change in tax residence would be effective in eliminating the imposition of such tax.
Notwithstanding the above, if any taxes referred to in this Condition 9 (Taxation) arise:
(a) due to any present or former connection of any Noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Noteholder if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, or a corporation) with The Netherlands (including without limitation, such Noteholder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having had a permanent establishment therein) otherwise than by reason only of the holding of any Note or receiving principal or interest in respect thereof;
(b) by reason of the failure by the relevant Noteholder to comply with any applicable procedures required to establish non-residence or other similar claim for exemption from such tax or to provide information concerning nationality, residency or connection with The Netherlands or other applicable taxing authority;
(c) under FATCA; or
(d) any combination of the preceding clauses (a) through (c) inclusive,
the requirement to substitute the Issuer as a principal obligor and/or change its residence for taxation purposes shall not apply.
10. Events of Default
(a) Note Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute a “Note Event of Default”:
(i) Non payment of interest
(1) the Issuer fails to pay any interest in respect of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes when the same becomes due; or
(2) in each case, following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class C Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable; following redemption if full of the Class D Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable; and following redemption if full of the Class E Notes failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class F Notes when the same becomes due and payable,

(ii) Non payment of principal
the Issuer fails to pay any principal when the same becomes due and payable on any Rated Note on the Maturity Date or any Redemption Date provided that, in the case of a failure to disburse due to an administrative error or omission, such failure continues for a period of at least five Business Days after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of, or has actual knowledge of, such administrative error or omission and provided further that failure to effect any Optional Redemption or redemption following a Note Tax Event for which notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Conditions or, in the case of an Optional Redemption with respect to which a Refinancing fails, will not constitute a Note Event of Default;

(iv) Collateral Obligations
On any Measurement Date after the Effective Date, failure of the percentage equivalent of a fraction,
(i) the numerator of which is equal to (1) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations other than Defaulted Obligations plus (2) the aggregate in respect of each Defaulted Obligation of its Market Value multiplied by its Principal Balance on such date plus (3) any Principal Proceeds standing to the credit of the Principal Account on such Measurement Date and (ii) the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Class A Notes to equal or exceed 102.5 per cent.;
(v) Breach of Other Obligations
except as otherwise provided in this definition of “Note Event of Default”, a default in a material respect in the performance by, or breach in a material respect of any material covenant of, the Issuer under the Trust Deed and/or these Conditions (provided that any failure to meet any Portfolio Profile Test, Collateral Quality Test, Coverage Test or Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not a Note Event of Default and any failure to satisfy the Effective Date Determination Requirements is not a Note Event of Default, except in either case to the extent provided in paragraph (iv) above) or the failure of any material representation, warranty, undertaking or other agreement of the Issuer made in the Trust Deed and/or these Conditions or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant thereto or in connection therewith to be correct in each case in all material respects when the same shall have been made, and the continuation of such default, breach or failure for a period of 30 days after the earlier of (a) the Issuer having actual knowledge of such default, breach or failure or (b) notice being given to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager by registered or certified mail or courier from the Trustee, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager, or to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager from the Controlling Class acting pursuant to an Ordinary Resolution, in each case copied to the Trustee (as applicable), specifying such default, breach or failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default” under the Trust Deed; provided that if the Issuer (as notified to the Trustee by the Collateral Manager in writing) has commenced curing such default, breach or failure during the 30 day period specified above, such default, breach or failure shall not constitute a Note Event of Default under this paragraph (v) unless it continues for a period of 45 days (rather than, and not in addition to, such 30 day period specified above) after the earlier of the Issuer having actual knowledge thereof or notice thereof in accordance herewith. For the purposes of this paragraph, the materiality of such default, breach, representation or warranty shall be determined by the Trustee;
(vi) Insolvency Proceedings
proceedings are initiated against the Issuer under any applicable liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy, composition, reorganisation or other similar laws (together, “Insolvency Law”), or a receiver, administrative receiver, trustee, administrator, custodian, conservator, liquidator, curator or other similar official (other than any party, including without limitation the Trustee and the Custodian, appointed or otherwise acting pursuant to or in connection with the Transaction Documents) (a “Receiver”) is appointed in relation to such proceedings and the whole or any substantial part of the undertaking or assets of the Issuer and, in any of the foregoing cases, except in relation to the appointment of a Receiver, is not discharged within 30 days; or the Issuer is subject to, or initiates or consents to, judicial proceedings relating to itself under any applicable Insolvency Law, or seeks the appointment of a Receiver, or makes a conveyance or assignment for the benefit of its creditors generally or otherwise becomes subject to any reorganisation or amalgamation (other than on terms previously approved in writing by the Trustee or by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class);
(vii) Illegality
it is or will become unlawful for the Issuer to perform or comply with any one or more of its obligations under the Notes; or
(viii) Investment Company Act
the Issuer or any of the Collateral becomes required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act and such requirement continues for 45 days.
(b) Acceleration
If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall, at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, (subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) give notice to the Issuer, each Hedge Counterparty and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable (such notice, an “Acceleration Notice”), whereupon the Notes shall become immediately due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices, provided that upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default described in paragraph
(vi) of the definition thereof, an Acceleration Notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and repayable at their applicable Redemption Prices.
(c) Curing of Default
At any time after an Acceleration Notice (whether deemed or otherwise) has been given pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) following the occurrence of a Note Event of Default and prior to enforcement of the security pursuant to Condition 11 (Enforcement), the Trustee, subject to receipt of consent in writing from the Controlling Class, may and shall, if so requested by the Controlling Class, in each case, acting by Extraordinary Resolution (and subject, in each case, to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) rescind and annul such Acceleration Notice under paragraph (b) above and its consequences if:
(i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or to its order) a sum sufficient to pay:
(A) all overdue payments of interest and principal on the Notes, other than the Subordinated Notes;
(B) all due but unpaid taxes owing by the Issuer, as certified by an Authorised Officer of the Issuer to the Trustee;
(C) all unpaid Administrative Expenses and Trustee Fees and Expenses in each case, without regard to the Senior Expenses Cap; and
(D) all amounts due and payable by the Issuer under any Currency Hedge Agreement or any Interest Rate Hedge Agreement; and
(ii) the Trustee has determined that all Events of Default, other than the non payment of the interest in respect of, or principal of, the Notes that have become due solely as a result of the acceleration thereof under paragraph (b) above due to such Events of Default, have been cured or waived.
Any previous rescission and annulment of an Acceleration Notice (whether deemed or otherwise) pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not prevent the subsequent acceleration of the Notes if the Trustee, at its discretion or as subsequently requested, accelerates the Notes or if the Notes are automatically accelerated in accordance with paragraph (b) above.
All amounts received in respect of this Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) shall be distributed two Business Days following receipt by the Trustee of payment or deposit from the Issuer, in accordance with paragraph (i) above and the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.
(d) Restriction on Acceleration
No direction to accelerate the Notes shall be permitted by any Class of Noteholders, other than the Controlling Class as provided in Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(e) Notification and Confirmation of No Default
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) and the Rating Agencies upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Note Event of Default. The Trust Deed contains provision for the Issuer to provide written confirmation to the Trustee and the Rating Agencies on an annual basis that no Note Event of Default has occurred and that no condition, event or act has occurred which, with the lapse of time and/or the issue, making or giving of any notice, certification, declaration and/or request and/or the taking of any similar action and/or the fulfilment of any similar condition would constitute a Note Event of Default and that no other matter which is required (pursuant thereto) to be brought to the Trustee’s attention has occurred.
(f) Collateral Manager Events of Default
Any of the following events shall constitute a “Collateral Manager Event of Default”:
(i) the Collateral Manager wilfully violates, or takes any action which it knows is in breach of any material provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed as are applicable to it, provided always that if the Collateral Manager does not breach any material provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed, the economic performance of the Collateral Obligations shall not constitute a Collateral Manager Event of Default;
(ii) the Collateral Manager breaches in any respect any material provision of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed applicable to it (other than as specified in paragraph (i) above) which breach (i) is, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Controlling Class and (ii) if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days of the Collateral Manager becoming aware of, or the Collateral Manager receiving notice from the Issuer or the Trustee of, such breach or, if such breach is not capable of cured within 30 days but is capable of being cured within a longer period, the Collateral Manager fails to cure such breach within the period in which a reasonably prudent person could cure such breach (but in no event more than 90 days);
(iii) the Collateral Manager is wound up or is dissolved or there is appointed over it or all or substantially all of its assets a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer; or the Collateral Manager: (i) ceases to be able to, or admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as they become due and payable, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of, or seeks or enters into any composition or arrangement with, its creditors generally; (ii) applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, trustee, assignee, custodian, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Collateral Manager or of any substantial part of its properties or assets, or authorises such an application or consent, or
proceedings seeking such appointment are commenced against the Collateral Manager without such authorisation, consent or application and either continue undismissed for 60 consecutive days or any such appointment is ordered by a court or regulatory body having jurisdiction; (iii) authorises or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or applies for or consents (by admission of material allegations of a petition or otherwise) to the application of any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, readjustment of debt, insolvency, dissolution, or similar law, or authorises such application or consent, or proceedings to such end are instituted against the Collateral Manager without such authorisation, application or consent and remain undismissed for 60 consecutive days or result in adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or the issuance of an order for relief or equivalent procedure; or (iv) permits or suffers all or any substantial part of its properties or assets to be sequestered, subject to execution of distress or attached by court order and the order (if contested in good faith) remains undismissed for 60 consecutive days;
(iv) the occurrence of a Note Event of Default (for the avoidance of doubt, only following the expiration of any grace period relating thereto) under Condition 10(a)(i) or (ii) (Note Events of Default) (except in those circumstances where such Note Event of Default is solely attributable to the actions or omissions of a third party which the Collateral Manager does not control);
(v) any action is taken by the Collateral Manager, or any of its senior executive officers involved in the management of the Collateral Obligations, that constitutes fraud or criminal activity in the performance of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or its other collateral management activities, or the Collateral Manager (or any senior officer of the Collateral Manager involved in its leveraged investment business) being found guilty of having committed a criminal offence materially related to the management of investments similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral;
(vi) the Collateral Manager shall be indicted or convicted, or any of its senior executive officers directly involved in the management of any of the Collateral Obligations shall be convicted, of a criminal offence under the laws of the United States or a state thereof or the laws of any other jurisdiction in which it conducts business, materially related to the Collateral Manager’s asset management business, unless, in the case of a conviction of a senior executive officer of the Collateral Manager directly involved in the management of any of the Collateral Obligations, such senior executive officer has, within 30 days after such occurrence, been removed from performing work in fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.;
(vii) the Collateral Manager resigning pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement; or
(viii) the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Tax Event.
Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement:
(x) upon the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default (other than pursuant to paragraph
(vii) of the definition thereof), the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may be terminated, and the Collateral Manager may be removed (i) at the Issuer’s discretion; (ii) by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution; or (iii) by holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Extraordinary Resolution (in each case, excluding any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, CM Non-Voting Notes and Notes held by the Collateral Manager or a Collateral Manager Related Person), upon 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee and each Rating Agency; and
(y) upon the occurrence of a removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager following a Collateral Manager Event of Default, the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders will have certain rights with respect to the appointment of a successor collateral manager, as more fully described in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Issuer acknowledges that the rights of the Controlling Class to participate in the selection or removal of the Collateral Manager following a Collateral Manager Event of Default, as described above, are the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default.
11. Enforcement
(a) Security Becoming Enforceable
Subject as provided in paragraph (b) below, the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral shall become enforceable upon an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration).
(b) Enforcement
At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion (but subject always to Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition)), and shall, if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution (subject, in each case, as provided in Condition 11(b)(ii) (Enforcement)), institute such proceedings or take such other action against the Issuer or take any other action as it may think fit to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes and, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Notes, realise and/or otherwise liquidate or sell the Collateral in whole or in part and/or take such other action as may be permitted under applicable laws against any Obligor in respect of the Collateral and/or take any other action to enforce or realise the security over the Collateral in accordance with the Trust Deed (such actions together, “Enforcement Actions”), in each case without any liability as to the consequences of such action and without having regard (save to the extent provided in Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)) to the effect of such action on the individual Noteholders of any Class or any other Secured Party provided however that:
(i) no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless:
(A) subject to being indemnified and/or prefunded and/or secured to its satisfaction, the Trustee (or an agent or Appointee on its behalf) determines subject to consultation by the Trustee or such agent or Appointee with the Collateral Manager that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting and allowing for any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith) would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) other than the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments (such amount the “Enforcement Threshold”) and such determination being an “Enforcement Threshold Determination”) and the Controlling Class agrees with such determination by an Extraordinary Resolution (in which case the Enforcement Threshold will be met); or
(B) subject to paragraph (ii) below, if the Enforcement Threshold will not have been met then, in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in sub-paragraph (i), (ii), (iv) or (vi) of Condition 10(a) (Note Events of Default), the Controlling Class directs the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Note Event of Default.
(ii) the Trustee shall not be bound to institute any Enforcement Action or take any other action unless, subject to the above, it is directed to do so by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution and in each case the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith. Following redemption and payment in full of the Rated Notes, the Trustee shall (provided it is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby become liable and all costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred by it in connection therewith) act upon the directions of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Extraordinary Resolution; and
(iii) for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Portfolio, the anticipated proceeds to be realised from any Enforcement Action and whether the Enforcement Threshold will be met, the Trustee may appoint an independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor to advise it and may obtain and rely on an opinion and/or advice of such independent investment banking firm or other appropriate advisor (the cost of which shall be payable as Trustee Fees and Expenses) and shall be exempted from any liability arising directly
or indirectly from any action taken or not taken by the Trustee in connection with such opinion and/or advice.
The Trustee shall notify the Noteholders, the Issuer, the Agents, the Collateral Manager, each Hedge Counterparty and the Rating Agencies in the event that it makes an Enforcement Threshold Determination at any time or takes any Enforcement Action at any time (such notice an “Enforcement Notice”). Following the effectiveness of an Acceleration Notice which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default) or, as the case may be, following automatic acceleration of the Notes or pursuant to an Optional Redemption in whole in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds, Principal Proceeds and the net proceeds of enforcement of the security over the Collateral (other than with respect to any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral or amounts standing to the credit of the Interest Account which represent Hedge Issuer Tax Credit Payments which are required to be paid or returned to a Hedge Counterparty outside the Priorities of Payment in accordance with the Hedge Agreement and/or Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts) or amounts standing to the credit of the Currency Account which represent Sale Proceeds, prepayments or redemptions (in each case excluding amounts representing Scheduled Periodic Hedge Issuer Payments) in respect of Non-Euro Obligations sold subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Currency Hedge Transaction which shall be paid to the relevant Hedge Counterparty in accordance with the terms thereof outside the Priorities of Payment), shall be credited to the Payment Account and shall be distributed in accordance with the following order of priority but in each case only to the extent that all payments of a higher priority have been made in full (the “Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments”):

(C) to the payment of Administrative Expenses in the priority stated in the definition thereof up to an amount equal to the Senior Expenses Cap in respect of the related Due Period, provided that, upon an acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) (which has not been rescinded or annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default)), the Senior Expenses Cap shall not apply in respect of such Administrative Expenses;

(3) thirdly, to the repayment of any Collateral Manager Advances and any interest thereon;
(S) to the payment:
(1) firstly, to the payment of Trustee Fees and Expenses (if any) not paid by reason of the Senior Expenses Cap; and

(T) to the payment of, on a pari passu and pro rata basis, any Defaulted Currency Hedge Termination Payments due to any Currency Hedge Counterparty, any Defaulted Interest Rate Hedge Termination Payments due to any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to the extent not paid out of any Hedge Termination Account or any relevant Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account;

(V) subject to the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold having been reached (after taking into account all prior distributions to Subordinated Noteholders and any distributions to be made to Subordinated Noteholders on such Payment Date, including pursuant to paragraph
(W) below, paragraph (CC) of the Interest Priority of Payments and paragraph (U) of the Principal Priority of Payments),
(1) firstly, to the payment to the Collateral Manager of 20 per cent. of any remaining proceeds (after any payment required to be made to the Subordinated Noteholders pursuant to paragraph (W) below to satisfy the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold) in payment of an Incentive Collateral Management Fee; and

(W) any remaining proceeds to the payment of principal on the Subordinated Notes on a pro rata basis and thereafter to the payment of interest on a pro rata basis on the Subordinated Notes (in each case determined upon redemption in full thereof by reference to the proportion that the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes held by Subordinated Noteholders bore to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to such redemption).
Where the payment of any amount in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payment set out above is subject to any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax or any other tax is payable by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of such amount, payment of the amount so deducted or withheld or of the tax shall be made to the relevant taxing authority pari passu with and, so far as possible, at the same time as the payment of the amount in respect of which the relevant deduction or withholding or other liability to tax has arisen.
(c) Only Trustee to Act
Only the Trustee may pursue the remedies available under the Trust Deed to enforce the rights of the Noteholders or, in respect of the Collateral, of any of the other Secured Parties under the Trust Deed and the Notes and no Noteholder or other Secured Party (other than the Trustee) may proceed directly against the Issuer or any of its assets unless the Trustee, having become bound to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed, fails or neglects to do so within a reasonable period after having received notice of such failure and such failure or neglect continues for at least 30 days following receipt of such notice by the Trustee. Any proceeds received by a Noteholder or other Secured Party pursuant to any such proceedings brought by a Noteholder or other Secured Party shall be paid promptly following receipt thereof to the Trustee for application pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed. After realisation of the security which has become enforceable and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, no Noteholder or other Secured Party may take any further steps against the Issuer to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes or the Issuer’s obligations to such Secured Party and all claims against the Issuer to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of the Notes or the Issuer’s obligations to such Secured Party and all claims against the Issuer in respect of such sums unpaid shall be extinguished. In particular, none of the Trustee, any Noteholder or any other Secured Party shall be entitled in respect thereof to petition or take any other step for the winding up of the Issuer except to the extent permitted under the Trust Deed.
(d) Purchase of Collateral by Noteholders or Collateral Manager
Upon any sale of any part of the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes under Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), whether made under the power of sale under the Trust Deed or by virtue of judicial proceedings, any Noteholder, the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may (but shall not be obliged to) bid for and purchase the Collateral or any part thereof and, upon compliance with
the terms of sale, may hold, retain, possess or dispose of such property in its or their own absolute right without accountability. In addition, any purchaser in any such sale which is a Noteholder may deliver Notes held by it in place of payment of the purchase price for such Collateral where the amount payable to such Noteholder in respect of such Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, had the purchase price been paid in cash, is equal to or exceeds such purchase price.
12. Prescription

Claims in respect of principal and interest payable on redemption in full of the relevant Notes while the Notes are represented by a Definitive Certificate will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required by Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) within a period of five years, in the case of interest, and ten years, in the case of principal, from the date on which payment in respect of such Notes is received by the Principal Paying Agent.
Notwithstanding the above, claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate will become void unless presented for payment within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the date on which any payment first becomes due.
13. Replacement of Notes
If any Note is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of the Transfer Agent, subject in each case to all applicable laws and Euronext Dublin requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer or the Transfer Agent may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

(A) change the reference rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes from EURIBOR to an alternative base rate (such rate, the “Alternative Base Rate”);

(D) amend provisions which reference an index that has an equivalent frequency and setting date to the index applicable to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation to the extent that no such equivalent is available; and
(E) make such other amendments as are necessary or advisable in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager to facilitate the foregoing changes,
provided that:
(1) unless the Alternative Base Rate is the Designated Base Rate, the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders (each acting by Ordinary Resolution) consent to such supplemental trust deed or other modification, authorisation or waiver (excluding any modification, authorisation or waiver in respect of a Hedge Agreement made in respect of sub-paragraph (C) above only);
(2) such amendments and modifications are being undertaken due to (x) a material disruption to LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark; (y) a change in the methodology of calculating LIBOR, EURIBOR or another applicable or related index or benchmark; or (z) LIBOR, EURIBOR or any other applicable or related index or benchmark ceasing to exist (or the reasonable expectation of the Collateral Manager (or
any Hedge Counterparty for amendments in respect of sub-paragraph (C) above only) that any of the events specified in sub-clause (x), (y) or (z) will occur);
(3) the Alternative Base Rate shall apply to each Class of Floating Rate Notes; and
(4) any such amendment does not affect the applicability of any floor in respect of the relevant reference rate.
“Designated Base Rate” means the rate (and, if applicable, the methodology for calculating such rate) formally proposed, recommended or recognised as an industry standard rate (whether by letter, protocol, publication of standard terms or otherwise) by the Loan Markets Association (or any successor organisation thereto) as a replacement reference rate for the calculation of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate.
Any such modification, authorisation or waiver shall be binding upon the Noteholders and shall be notified by the Issuer as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of any supplemental trust deed or any other modification, authorisation or waiver pursuant to this Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) to:
(A) each Rating Agency, so long as any of the Rated Notes remain Outstanding; and
(B) the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and in the Trust Deed, the Issuer shall not agree to amend, modify or supplement any provisions of the Transaction Documents if, such change shall have a material adverse effect on the rights or obligations of a Hedge Counterparty without the Hedge Counterparty’s prior written consent or on the Collateral Manager without the Collateral Manager’s written consent.
To the extent required pursuant to a Hedge Agreement, the Issuer shall notify each Hedge Counterparty of any proposed amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents and seek the prior consent of such Hedge Counterparty in respect thereof, in each case to the extent required in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such notice shall only be given and such consent shall only be sought to the extent required above or in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement. If a Hedge Agreement allows a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request, during such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer shall not make any such proposed amendment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders (other than as otherwise provided in paragraphs (x), (xii), (xvi), (xix) and (xxix) above) or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer in making any modification, amendment, waiver or authorisation which the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee is entitled to rely without enquiry or liability) is required pursuant to the paragraphs above (other than a modification, waiver or authorisation pursuant to paragraphs (xi) or (xiii) above in which the Trustee may, without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party, concur with the Issuer) to the Transaction Documents, provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged to agree to any modification or any other matter which, in the opinion of the Trustee, would have the effect of (i) exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or (ii) adding to or increasing the obligations, liabilities or duties, or decreasing the rights, indemnities or protections, of the Trustee in respect of the Transaction Documents.
In the case of a request for consent to a modification, amendment, waiver or authorisation pursuant to paragraphs above, under no circumstances shall the Trustee be required to give such consent on less than 21 days’ prior written notice and the Trustee shall be entitled to obtain legal, financial or other expert advice, at the expense of the Issuer, and rely on such advice in connection with determining whether or not to give such consent (if applicable or required) as it sees fit.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, any material amendments or modifications to these Conditions, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to this Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to Euronext Dublin.
The Issuer may, without the consent of any other Person, make such amendments to the Letter of Undertaking or the Issuer Management Agreement as shall be necessary to document the resignation, replacement and/or appointment of one or more Managing Directors, provided that following such amendments, such documents shall be in substantially the same form as those entered into on the Issue Date. Upon the effectiveness of such amendments, the Issuer shall provide notice thereof to the Trustee and each of the other Parties to the Letter of Undertaking and the Issuer Management Agreement.
(d) Substitution
The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee to agree, subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed and such other conditions as the Trustee may require (without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class), to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes of each Class, if required for taxation purposes, provided that such substitution would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, but subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to receipt of such information and/or opinions as the Rating Agency may require), to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed, provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class. Any substitution agreed by the Trustee pursuant to this Condition 14(d) (Substitution) shall be binding on the Noteholders, and shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may direct.
The Issuer shall procure that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, any material amendments or modifications to the Conditions, the Trust Deed or such other conditions made pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) shall be notified to Euronext Dublin.
(e) Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest
In connection with the exercise of its trusts, powers, duties and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest)), the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of each Class of Noteholders as a Class and shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise for individual Noteholders of such Class and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 9 (Taxation).
In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificates are held on behalf of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to each Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of any Global Certificate.
The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest between or among the holders of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of (i) the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders over the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (ii) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (iv) the Class D Noteholders
over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, (v) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders and (vi) the Class F Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. If the Trustee receives conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of a Class, given priority as described in this paragraph, each representing less than the majority by principal amount of such Class, the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater amount of Notes Outstanding of such Class. The Trust Deed provides further that, except as expressly provided otherwise in any applicable Transaction Document or these Conditions, the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class where the holders of the Class or Classes having priority over such other Class do not have an interest in the subject matter of such directions) (in each case acting by Extraordinary Resolution) subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of and is exempted from any liability to the holders of any other Class of Notes.
In addition, the Trust Deed provides that, so long as any Note is Outstanding, the Trustee shall, as regards all powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions vested in it by the Trust Deed, have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party other than the Noteholders or, at any time, to the interests of any other person.
15. Indemnification of the Trustee
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances, including provisions relieving it from instituting proceedings to enforce repayment or to enforce the security constituted by or pursuant to the Trust Deed, unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document and any entity related to the Issuer or any other party to any Transaction Document without accounting for any profit. The Trustee is exempted from any liability in respect of any loss or theft of the Collateral, from any obligation to insure, or to monitor the provisions of any insurance arrangements in respect of, the Collateral (for the avoidance of doubt, under the Trust Deed the Trustee is under no such obligation) and from any claim arising from the fact that the Collateral is held by the Custodian or is otherwise held in safe custody by a bank or other custodian. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the performance by the Custodian of any of its duties under the Agency and Account Bank Agreement or for the performance by the Collateral Manager of any of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, for the performance by the Collateral Administrator of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or for the performance by any other person appointed by the Issuer in relation to the Notes or by any other party to any Transaction Document. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for the administration, management or operation of the Collateral including the request by the Collateral Manager to release any of the Collateral from time to time.
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement of the Trustee and the removal of the Trustee by Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, but no such retirement or removal shall become effective until a successor trustee is appointed.
16. Notices
Notices to Noteholders will be valid if posted to the address of such Noteholder appearing in the Register at the time of publication of such notice by pre paid, first class mail (or any other manner approved by the Trustee which may be by electronic transmission) and (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require) shall be sent to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders (a) in the case of inland mail three days after the date of dispatch thereof, (b) in the case of overseas mail, seven days after the dispatch thereof or, (c) in the case of electronic transmission, on the date of dispatch.
Notices will be valid and will be deemed to have been given, for so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin, when such notice is filed in the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin or such other process as Euronext Dublin may require.
The Trustee shall be at liberty to sanction some other method of giving notice to the Noteholders (or a category of them) if, in its opinion, such other method is reasonable having regard to market practice then prevailing and to the rules of the stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed and provided that notice of such other method is given to the Noteholders in such manner as the Trustee shall require.
Notwithstanding the above, so long as any Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for delivery thereof as required by the Conditions of such Notes provided that such notice is also made to the Company Announcements Office of Euronext Dublin for so long as such Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require.

18. Third Party Rights
No person shall have any right to enforce any term or Condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
19. Governing Law

(a) Governing Law
The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Issuer Management Agreement and the Letter of Undertaking are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands.
(b) Jurisdiction
The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non-contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process
The Issuer appoints TMF Global Services (UK) Limited (having an office, at the date hereof, at 6 St Andrew Street, 5th Floor, London EC4A 3AE) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer does not have such agent in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication, approximately €250,000 to be deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) are expected to be approximately €418,550,000. Such proceeds will be used by the Issuer to (i) redeem the Refinanced Notes at their respective aggregate Redemption Prices, (ii) pay certain Administrative Expenses (including Refinancing Costs) and/or Trustee Fees and Expenses (including Refinancing Costs), as applicable, in accordance with the Conditions, (iii) pay certain other amounts in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and (iv) to be transferred to the Principal Account to be applied, among other things, toward the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations (including the) Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations).
FORM OF THE REFINANCING NOTES
The following description of the form of the Refinancing Notes consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Global Certificate which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such document.
References below to Refinancing Notes and to the Global Certificates and the Definitive Certificates representing such Refinancing Notes are to each respective Class of Refinancing Notes, except as otherwise indicated.
Initial Issue of Refinancing Notes
The Refinancing Notes will be sold only to (i) non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act and (ii) QIBs that are also either QPs or entities owned exclusively by QPs. Except as described below, each Refinancing Note sold to a Person that, at the time of the acquisition, purported acquisition or proposed acquisition of any such Refinancing Note, is both a QIB and a QP will be issued in the form of Rule 144A Global Certificates. Except as described below, Refinancing Notes sold to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S will be issued in the form of Regulation S Global Certificates.
Each initial purchaser and subsequent transferee of an interest in Refinancing Notes held in the form of a Global Certificate will be deemed (or, in certain cases, required) to represent, among other matters, as to its status under the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and ERISA. The Issuer has the right, under the Trust Deed, to compel any Non-Permitted Noteholder to sell its interest in such Refinancing Note, or may sell such interest on behalf of such owner.
The Regulation S Notes of each Class will be represented on issue by a Regulation S Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held at any time only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Certificate may not be held by a U.S. Person or U.S. Resident at any time. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, among other things, that it is not a U.S. Person, and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest only to a person (a) whom the seller reasonably believes to be a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, or (b) to be a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate (or, in the case of the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes and, if applicable, a Rule 144A Definitive Certificate). See “Transfer Restrictions”.
The Rule 144A Notes of each Class will be represented on issue by a Rule 144A Global Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may only be held at any time through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. See “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”. By acquisition of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate, the purchaser thereof will be deemed to represent, amongst other things, that it is a QIB/QP and that, if in the future it determines to transfer such beneficial interest, it will transfer such interest in accordance with the procedures and restrictions contained in the Trust Deed. See “Transfer Restrictions”.
Beneficial interests in Global Certificates will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and as set forth in Rule 144A and Regulation S, and the Refinancing Notes will bear the applicable legends regarding the restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”.
Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Refinancing Notes.
Each initial investor and each transferee of a Class E Note or a Class F Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or Regulation S Global Certificate either (a) shall be deemed to represent (among other things) that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, a Controlling Person or a Benefit Plan Investor or (b) may not acquire such Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Rule 144A Global Certificate or Regulation S Global Certificate unless such transferee: (i) obtains the written consent of the Issuer (other than in the case of the Refinancing Notes purchased by the Collateral Manager); (ii) provides an ERISA certificate to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person (substantially in the form of Annex D (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular); and (iii) unless the written consent of the Issuer to the contrary is obtained and other than in
the case of the Refinancing Notes purchased by the Collateral Manager, holds such Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate.
No proposed transfer of Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or interests therein) will be permitted or recognised if a transfer to a transferee will cause 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes or Class F Notes (determined separately by Class) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors, disregarding Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or interests therein) held by Controlling Persons. See “Certain ERISA Considerations”.
The Refinancing Notes are not issuable in bearer form.
Exchange for Definitive Certificates

Exchange

Each Global Certificate will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Definitive Exchange Date (as defined below), in whole but not in part, for Definitive Certificates if a Global Certificate is held (directly or indirectly) on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or an alternative clearing system and any such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces its intention to permanently cease business or does in fact do so.
In addition, interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes may be exchangeable for interests in a Definitive Certificate representing the Class E Note or Class F Note if a transferee is acting on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person provided: (i) such transferee has obtained the written consent of the Issuer in respect of such transfer; and (ii) the transferee has provided the Issuer with an ERISA certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 6 to the Trust Deed (Form of ERISA Certificate).
Interests in Global Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes may be exchangeable for interests in Definitive Certificates representing Class E Notes or Class F Notes in accordance with the Conditions as amended above.
The Registrar will not register the transfer of, or exchange of interests in, a Global Certificate for Definitive Certificates during the period from (but excluding) the Record Date to (and including) the date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Refinancing Notes.
If only one of the Global Certificates (the “Exchanged Global Certificate”) becomes exchangeable for Definitive Certificates in accordance with the above paragraphs, transfers of Refinancing Notes may not take place between, on the one hand, persons holding Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Exchanged Global Certificate and, on the other hand, persons wishing to purchase beneficial interests in the other Global Certificate.
“Definitive Exchange Date” means a day falling not less than 30 days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar and the Transfer Agent is located.
Delivery

In the event a Global Certificate is to be exchanged, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Definitive Certificates and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under “Transfer Restrictions”.
Legends

The holder of a Class E Note or Class F Note may transfer the Refinancing Notes represented thereby in whole or in part in the applicable Minimum Denomination by surrendering such Refinancing Note(s) at the specified office of the Registrar or the Transfer Agent, together with the completed form of transfer and, to the extent applicable, written consent of the Issuer and a duly completed ERISA certificate substantially in the form of Annex D (Form of ERISA Certificate). Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Class E Note or Class F Note bearing the legend referred to under “Transfer Restrictions” below, or upon specific request for removal of the legend on a Definitive Certificate in registered definitive form, as applicable, the Issuer will deliver only Class E Notes or Class F Notes that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. With the written consent of the Issuer, a Class E Note or Class F Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate, subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Certificate or a Regulation S Global Certificate (as applicable).

Each Regulation S Global Certificate and each Rule 144A Global Certificate will have an ISIN and a Common Code and will be registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Refinancing Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be). The Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any payment in respect of Refinancing Notes represented by a Global Certificate, the common depositary by whom such Refinancing Note is held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the relevant Participants’ or accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Certificate as shown on the records of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee.

Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from any Clearing System of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct Participant or Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Refinancing Notes held within the Clearing System will be effected by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in such Refinancing Notes, unless and until interests in any Global Certificate held within a Clearing System are exchanged for Definitive Certificates.
No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Refinancing Notes held within such Clearing System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Refinancing Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the Clearing Systems to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.

RATINGS OF THE REFINANCING NOTES

General
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Refinancing Notes that the Refinancing Notes be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class X Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class A Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B Notes: “Aa2(sf)” from Moody’s and “AA(sf)” from S&P; the Class C Notes: “A2(sf)” from Moody’s and “A(sf)” from S&P; the Class D Notes: “Baa3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BBB-(sf)” from S&P; the Class E Notes: “Ba3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BB-(sf)” from S&P; and the Class F Notes: “B3(sf)” from Moody’s and “B-(sf)” from S&P.
The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Refinancing Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency.
Moody’s Ratings
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.
Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.
In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.
S&P Ratings
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and
(c) legal considerations.
Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied until the end of the Reinvestment Period.
S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand.
For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.
Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.
There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.
S&P’s ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.

Ares has over 1,000 employees in over 20 global offices across the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Ares manages three distinct but complementary investment groups that invest in the credit, private equity and real estate markets and has the ability to invest in all levels of the capital structure.
Ares was built upon the fundamental principle that each group benefits from being part of the broader platform. Ares believes the synergies resulting from collaboration across the Ares Credit platform provide its professionals with more informed decision making as a result of shared industry expertise, management relationships, and market insights, access to significant deal flow and a broader opportunity set, and the ability to assess relative value. Since our inception in 1997, we have adhered to a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering attractive risk-adjusted investment returns through market cycles. We strive to maintain a consistent and credit-quality focused approach targeting well-structured investments in franchise businesses and real estate assets.
Ares investment groups are described below:
*As of June 30, 2019, AUM amounts include funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation and a registered investment adviser. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
Credit Group. Our Credit Group is a leading manager of credit strategies across the non-investment grade credit universe, with approximately $105.5 billion of AUM and 170 funds as of June 30, 2019. We offer a range of investment strategies across the liquid and illiquid credit spectrum. Since the firm’s founding in 1997, Ares has been a leader in providing credit solutions to investors searching for yield and for less correlated returns,
1 As of June 30, 2019. AUM amounts include funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation and a registered investment adviser.
particularly relevant in today’s relatively low interest rate and volatile investment environment. We are additionally one of the largest self-originating direct lenders to the U.S. and European middle markets, providing one-stop financing solutions for small-to-medium sized companies, which we believe are increasingly underserved by traditional lenders. We provide investors access to our broad credit capabilities through several vehicles, including commingled funds, separately managed accounts, publicly traded vehicles and sub-advised funds for retail investors.
Private Equity Group. Our Private Equity Group has achieved compelling risk-adjusted investment returns for a loyal and growing group of high profile limited partners and has approximately $24.7 billion of AUM as of June 30, 2019. Our Private Equity Group broadly categorizes its investment strategies as corporate private equity, special opportunities, energy opportunities and infrastructure and power. Our private equity professionals have a demonstrated ability to deploy flexible capital, which allows them to stay both active and disciplined in various market environments. The group's activities are managed by three dedicated investment teams in North America, Europe and China. The group manages flagship funds focused primarily on North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe, special opportunities funds, U.S. infrastructure and power funds and related co-investment vehicles and a China growth fund.
Real Estate Group. Our Real Estate Group manages comprehensive public and private equity and debt strategies, with approximately $11.9 billion of AUM as of June 30, 2019. With its experienced team, along with its expansive network of relationships, our Real Estate Group capitalizes on opportunities across both real estate equity and debt investing. Our Real Estate Group's equity investments focus on implementing hands-on value creation initiatives to mismanaged and capital-starved assets, as well as new development, ultimately selling stabilized assets back into the market. Our debt strategies leverage our Real Estate Group's diverse sources of capital to directly originate and manage commercial mortgage investments on properties that range from stabilized to requiring hands-on value creation. Our Real Estate Group has achieved significant scale in a short period of time through various acquisitions and successful fundraising efforts. Our Real Estate Group provides investors access to its capabilities through several vehicles: a publicly traded commercial mortgage real estate investment trust ("REIT"), Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE: ACRE), U.S. and European real estate private equity commingled funds and real estate equity and debt separately managed accounts. Our Real Estate Group's activities are managed by dedicated equity and debt teams in the U.S. and Europe.
In addition to the primary business platforms, Ares has an experienced team of support professionals in investor relations, marketing, accounting, finance, legal, compliance, operations, technology, human resources and administration.
We have an established track record of delivering favourable risk-adjusted returns through market cycles. We believe our consistent performance in a broad range of alternative assets has been shaped by several distinguishing features of our platform:
 Robust Sourcing Model: our investment professionals’ local market presence and ability to effectively cross-source for other investment groups generates a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities across our platform.
 Comprehensive Multi-Asset Class Experience and Flexible Capital: our proficiency at evaluating every level of the capital structure, from senior debt to common equity, across companies, structured assets, power and energy assets, and real estate projects enables us to effectively assess relative value. This proficiency is complemented by our flexibility in deploying capital in a range of structures and different market environments to maximize risk-adjusted returns.
 Differentiated Market Intelligence: our proprietary research in approximately 55 industries and insights from a broad, global investment portfolio enable us to more effectively diligence and structure our products and investments.
 Consistent Investment Approach: we believe our rigorous, credit-oriented investment approach across each of our investment groups is a key contributor to our strong investment performance and ability to expand our product offering.
 Talented and Committed Professionals: we attract, develop and retain highly accomplished investment professionals who not only demonstrate deep and broad investment expertise but also have a strong sense of commitment to our Firm.
 Collaborative Culture: we share ideas, relationships and information across our investment groups, which enable us to more effectively source, evaluate and manage investments.

THE PORTFOLIO
The following description of the Portfolio consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.
Introduction
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.
Acquisition of Collateral Obligations
The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Unsecured Senior Loans, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds during the Subsequent Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least
€405,000,000 which is approximately 90 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. The proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (including amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations); and (b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes, will be deposited in the Expense Reserve Account on the Issue Date. The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Principal Account during the Subsequent Investment Period.
The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Subsequent Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 17 December 2019, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.
On or after the Effective Date but prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date, no more than 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (in aggregate) may be transferred to the Interest Account in one or more instalments, in aggregate and without duplication, from the Principal Account; (i) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer into the Interest Account the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (for which purposes the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lesser of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; and (ii) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer each of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (save for the Interest Coverage Tests, which shall apply only on and after the Determination Date falling immediately prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date) is satisfied.
Within 10 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the “Effective Date Report”) containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether (A) the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments in respect of a Collateral Obligation following acquisition by the Issuer shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value), (B) the S&P CDO Monitor Test is satisfied (based on an S&P Weighted Average Spread calculated without any EURIBOR Floor Adjustment and excluding any Principal Proceeds which may be designated as Interest Proceeds on and after the Effective Date) and (C) the Effective Date Determination Requirements have been satisfied, and within 15 Business Days following the Effective Date the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide, to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (with a copy to the Collateral Manager, if applicable), an accountants’ certificate recalculating and comparing the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at the Effective Date
and the results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests) by reference to such Collateral Obligations. The accountants’ certificate shall specify the procedures undertaken to review data and re-computations relating to such recalculations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator shall not disclose to any Person (including any Noteholder) any information, documents or reports provided to them by the accountants, other than as required by a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable legal or regulatory process.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that (x) if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s and (y) if the Effective Date S&P Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from S&P. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies, or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan upon request therefor by the Collateral Manager; or (ii) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied or the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.
During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations and/or any other intended action which is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.
On and prior to the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager has caused to be acquired by the Issuer (a) a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Unsecured Senior Loans, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds, the details of which as at 7 August 2019 with respect to the latest Payment Date Report are set out in Annex E (Payment Date Report) and 7 October 2019 with respect to the latest Monthly Report as set out in Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto; and (b) from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement, the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations on the Issue Date.
Such information is limited and does not provide a full description of all Collateral Obligations previously held or sold by the Issuer, nor the gains or losses associated with purchases or sales of Collateral Obligations, nor the levels of compliance with the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests (or any other tests applicable to the Portfolio) during periods prior to the periods covered by the latest Monthly Report and/or the latest Payment Date Report. Such reports contain information as of the dates specified therein and none of the reports are calculated as of the date of this Offering Circular. As such, the information in the report may no longer reflect the characteristics of the Collateral Obligations as of the date of this Offering Circular or on or after the Issue Date.

(mm) it is not an obligation that contains limited recourse provisions that limit the obligations of the Obligor thereunder to a defined portfolio or pool of assets; and
(nn) it is not an obligation of a company whose principal business is directly derived from the production or marketing of controversial weapons (including antipersonnel landmines, cluster weapons, chemical and biological weapons); development of nuclear weapon programs or production of nuclear weapons and thermal coal production.
Other than (i) an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date, (ii) a Collateral Obligation (other than a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation or an Original Obligation) purchased prior to the Issue Date which must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the date on which a binding commitment to purchase it was entered into and (iii) a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation which shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) requested the acquisition of such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement and (iv) Collateral Obligations which are the subject of a restructuring (whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor) which must satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria on the applicable Restructuring Date, the subsequent failure of any Collateral Obligation to satisfy any of the Eligibility Criteria shall not prevent any obligation which would otherwise be a Collateral Obligation from being a Collateral Obligation so long as such obligation satisfied the Eligibility Criteria, when the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer entered into a binding agreement to purchase such obligation.
“Non-Recourse Obligation” means an obligation that falls into any one of the following types of specialised lending:
(a) Project Finance: a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of payment and as security for the exposure. Repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.
(b) Object Finance: a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties.
(c) Commodities Finance: a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet.
(d) Income-producing real estate: a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset.
(e) High-volatility commercial real estate: a financing or any of the land acquisition, development and construction phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions, where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate).
“Project Finance Loan” means a loan obligation under which the obligor is obliged to make payments that depend (except for rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of payments) on revenues arising from infrastructure assets, including, without limitation:
(a) the sale of products, such as electricity, water, gas or oil, generated by one or more infrastructure assets in the utility industry by a special purpose entity; and
(b) fees charged in respect of one or more highways, bridges, tunnels, pipelines or other infrastructure assets by a special purpose entity, and
in each case, the sole activity of such special purpose entity is the ownership and/or management of such asset or assets and the acquisition and/or development of such asset by the special purpose entity was effected primarily with the proceeds of debt financing made available to it on a limited recourse basis.
“Step-Down Coupon Security” means a security, the contractual interest rate of which decreases over a specified period of time. For the avoidance of doubt, a security will not be considered to be a Step-Down Coupon Security where interest payments decrease for non-contractual reasons due to unscheduled events such as a decrease in the index relating to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, the change from a default rate of interest to a non-default rate, or an improvement in the Obligor’s financial condition.
“Step-Up Coupon Security” means a security the interest rate of which increases over a specified period of time other than due to the increase of the floating rate index applicable to such security.
“Zero Coupon Security” means a security (other than a Step-Up Coupon Security) that, at the time of determination, does not provide for periodic payments of interest.
Restructured Obligations
In the event a Collateral Obligation becomes (as determined by the Issuer, assisted by the Collateral Manager) the subject of a restructuring whether effected by way of an amendment to the terms of such Collateral Obligation (including but not limited to an amendment of its maturity date) or by way of substitution of new obligations and/or change of Obligor, such obligation shall only constitute a Restructured Obligation if such obligation satisfies each of the criteria comprising the Eligibility Criteria other than paragraphs (c), (i) and (j) thereof, it is not a pre-funded letter of credit and it has an S&P Rating (together, the “Restructured Obligation Criteria”).
For the avoidance of doubt, a repayment of a Collateral Obligation in circumstances whereby the redemption proceeds are rolled as consideration for a new obligation (including by way of a “cashless roll”) shall be treated as the acquisition by the Issuer of a new Collateral Obligation and not as the acquisition of a Restructured Obligation and such new obligation shall be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and the Reinvestment Criteria.
Management of the Portfolio

Overview

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is permitted, in certain circumstances and, subject to certain requirements, to discretionally sell Collateral Obligations and Exchanged Securities and to reinvest the Sale Proceeds (other than accrued interest on such Collateral Obligations included in Interest Proceeds by the Collateral Manager) thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Collateral Administrator of all necessary details of the Collateral Obligation or Exchanged Security to be sold and the proposed Substitute Collateral Obligation to be purchased and the Collateral Administrator (on behalf of the Issuer) shall determine and shall provide confirmation of whether the Portfolio Profile Tests and Reinvestment Criteria which are required to be satisfied, maintained or improved in connection with any such sale or reinvestment are satisfied, maintained or improved or, if any such criteria are not satisfied, maintained or improved, shall notify the Issuer and the Collateral Manager of the reasons and the extent to which such criteria are not so satisfied, maintained or improved.
The Collateral Manager will determine and use reasonable endeavours to cause to be purchased by the Issuer, Collateral Obligations (including all Substitute Collateral Obligations) taking into account the Eligibility Criteria, the guidelines in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and, where applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria and will monitor the performance of the Collateral Obligations on an ongoing basis to the extent practicable using sources of information reasonably available to it and provided that the Collateral Manager shall not be responsible for determining whether or not the terms of any individual Collateral Obligation have been observed.
The activities referred to below that the Collateral Manager may undertake on behalf of the Issuer are subject to the Issuer’s monitoring of the performance of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Sale of Non-Eligible Original Issue Date Collateral Obligations

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall sell any Original Issue Date Collateral Obligations which did not comply with the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date (each a “Non-Eligible Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation”). Any Sale Proceeds received in connection therewith may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria (or, if invested prior to the Issue Date, the Original Eligibility Criteria) or credited to the Principal Account pending such reinvestment.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, Defaulted Obligations and Equity Securities

Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations and Defaulted Obligations may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer), subject to, within the Collateral Manager’s knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
The Collateral Manager shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to effect the sale of any Equity Securities in the Portfolio, regardless of the price it receives for such Equity Securities.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Sale of Exchanged Securities

Any Exchanged Security may be sold at any time by the Collateral Manager in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer), subject to, within the Collateral Manager’s knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Event of Default having occurred which is continuing.
In addition to any discretionary sale of Exchanged Securities as provided above, the Collateral Manager shall be required by the Issuer to use commercially reasonable endeavours to sell (on behalf of the Issuer) any Exchanged Security which constitutes Margin Stock as soon as practicable upon its receipt or upon its becoming Margin Stock (as applicable), unless such sale is prohibited by applicable law, in which case such Equity Security shall be sold as soon as such sale is permitted by applicable law.
Discretionary Sales

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may dispose of any Collateral Obligation (other than a Credit Improved Obligation, a Credit Risk Obligation, a Defaulted Obligation or an Exchanged Security, each of which may only be sold in the circumstances provided above) at any time (other than during a Restricted Trading Period) (“Discretionary Sales”) provided:
(a) no Note Event of Default has occurred which is continuing (in the case of the Collateral Manager, to its knowledge, without the need for inquiry or investigation);
(b) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations sold as described in this paragraph during the preceding 12 calendar months (or, for the first 12 calendar months after the Issue Date, during the period commencing on the Issue Date) is not greater than 25 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount as of the first day of such 12 calendar month period (or as of the Issue Date, as the case may be);
(c) either:
(i) during the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager reasonably believes prior to such sale that it will be able to enter into one or more binding commitments to reinvest all or a portion of the proceeds of such sale in one or more additional Collateral Obligations within 50 days after the settlement of such sale in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria; or
(ii) at any time either (1) the Sale Proceeds from such sale are at least equal to the Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligation sold (as defined below) or (2) after giving effect to such sale, the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) of all Collateral Obligations (excluding the Collateral Obligation being sold but including, without duplication, the expected Sale Proceeds of such sale) plus, without duplication, the amounts on deposit in the Principal Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) will be greater than (or equal to) the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; and
(d) no Retention Deficiency occurs as a result of, or immediately after giving effect to, such disposal.
Restricted Trading Period

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on its behalf) shall promptly notify S&P and Moody’s upon the occurrence of a Restricted Trading Period.
Sale of Collateral Prior to Maturity Date

In the event of: (i) any redemption of the Rated Notes in whole prior to the Maturity Date; (ii) receipt of notification from the Trustee of enforcement of the security over the Collateral; or (iii) the purchase of Notes of any Class by the Issuer, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) will (with regard to (ii), if requested by the Trustee following the enforcement of such security), as far as reasonably practicable, arrange for liquidation of the Collateral in order to procure that the proceeds thereof are in immediately available funds by the Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date or date of sale of all or part of the Portfolio, as applicable, in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) and clause 21 (Realisation of Collateral) of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement but without regard to the limitations set out in Schedule 3 (Eligibility Criteria) of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (which will include any limitations or restrictions set out in the Conditions and the Trust Deed).
Sale of Assets which do not Constitute Collateral Obligations

In the event that an asset did not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the date it was required to do so in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to sell such asset. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
Reinvestment of Collateral Obligations

“Reinvestment Criteria” means, during the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out under “During the Reinvestment Period” below and, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the criteria set out below under “Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. The Reinvestment Criteria (except satisfaction of the Eligibility Criteria) shall not apply prior to the Effective Date in the case of a Collateral Obligation which has been restructured (except satisfaction of the Restructured Obligation Criteria) where such restructuring has become binding on the holders thereof.
During the Reinvestment Period

During the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, at its discretion, reinvest any Principal Proceeds (with the exception of Principal Proceeds received both before and after the Reinvestment Period in connection with the acceptance of an Offer where such Offer is by way of novation or substitution, where such principal proceeds will be reinvested automatically as consideration for the novated or substitute Collateral Obligation (subject to the Restructured Obligation Criteria being satisfied)) in the purchase of Substitute Collateral Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria provided that immediately after entering into a binding commitment to acquire such Collateral Obligation and taking into account existing commitments, the criteria set out below must be satisfied:
(a) to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(b) such obligation is a Collateral Obligation;
(c) on and after the Effective Date (or in the case of the Interest Coverage Tests, the second Payment Date) the Coverage Tests are satisfied or if (other than with respect to the reinvestment of any proceeds received upon the sale of, or as a recovery on, any Defaulted Obligation) as calculated immediately prior to any purchase of a Substitute Collateral Obligation any Coverage Test was not satisfied, the coverage ratio relating to such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the results as calculated immediately prior to such sale, prepayment or repayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation;
(d) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Risk Obligation or a Defaulted Obligation either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased with such Sale Proceeds shall at least equal such Sale Proceeds;
(ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) of all Collateral Obligations (after such purchase) will be maintained or increased, when respectively compared to the Aggregate Principal Balance (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) of all Collateral Obligations immediately prior to such sale; or
(iii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations) (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) is equal to or greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(e) in the case of a Substitute Collateral Obligation purchased with Sale Proceeds of a Credit Improved Obligation or a Discretionary Sale either:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted
Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) immediately prior to the sale that generates such Sale Proceeds; or
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations) (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance;
(f) on and after the Effective Date either (A) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be satisfied; or (B) as calculated immediately prior to any purchase of a Substitute Collateral Obligation, if any of the Portfolio Profile Tests or Collateral Quality Tests are not satisfied such tests will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the results of such tests immediately prior to the sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation the Principal Proceeds of which are being reinvested, save that this paragraph (f) shall not apply in respect of the S&P CDO Monitor Test in the case of the reinvestment of Sale Proceeds from Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations;
(g) no Retention Deficiency occurs as a result of, or immediately after giving effect to, such reinvestment; and
(h) with respect to the reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds (other than Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and/or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from Credit Improved Obligations, Credit Risk Obligations, Defaulted Obligations, Equity Securities and Exchanged Equity Securities) any of:
(i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations shall be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment when compared with the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (for which purpose the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its Market Value) immediately prior to the sale that generates such Sale Proceeds;
(ii) the sum of: (A) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations (excluding all of the Collateral Obligations being sold but including, without duplication, the Collateral Obligations being purchased and the anticipated cash proceeds, if any, of such sale that are not applied to the purchase of such Substitute Collateral Obligations) (for which purposes, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be multiplied by its S&P Collateral Value); and (B) amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account (to the extent such amounts have not and will not be designated as Interest Proceeds to be credited to the Interest Account and including Eligible Investments therein but save for any interest accrued on Eligible Investments) is greater than the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; or
(iii) the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount is maintained or increased,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has occurred during the Reinvestment Period but which settle after such date, the purchase of such Collateral Obligations shall be treated as a purchase made during the Reinvestment Period for purposes of the Trust Deed.
Following the Expiry of the Reinvestment Period

Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, only Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations (with the exception of principal proceeds received both before and after the Reinvestment Period in connection with the acceptance of an Offer where such Offer is by way of novation or substitution, where such principal proceeds will be reinvested automatically as consideration for the novated or substitute Collateral Obligation (subject to the Restructured Obligation Criteria being satisfied)), only, may be reinvested by the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) in one or more Substitute Collateral Obligations satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, in each case provided that:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of Substitute Collateral Obligations equals or exceeds (i) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the related Collateral Obligations that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds or (ii) the amount of Sale Proceeds of such Credit Risk Obligation;
(b) if the Weighted Average Life Test was not satisfied as of the last day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test will be satisfied immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment, or (ii) if the Weighted Average Life Test was satisfied as of the last day of the Reinvestment Period, the Weighted Average Life Test will be satisfied or, if not satisfied, maintained or improved immediately after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(c) a Restricted Trading Period is not currently in effect;
(d) each of the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests (except the S&P CDO Monitor Test, the Weighted Average Life Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test and the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test) are (i) satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment or (ii) if any such test was not immediately satisfied prior to such investment, such test will be maintained or improved after giving effect to such reinvestment compared with the results of such tests immediately prior to the sale or prepayment (in whole or in part) of the relevant Collateral Obligation the Principal Proceeds of which are being reinvested;
(e) each of the Coverage Tests are satisfied both before and after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(f) to the Collateral Manager’s knowledge (without the need for inquiry or investigation), no Note Event of Default has occurred that is continuing at the time of such purchase;
(g) no Retention Deficiency occurs as a result of, and immediately after giving effect to, such reinvestment;
(h) (i) the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of each Substitute Collateral Obligation is the same as or earlier than the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds and (ii) (A) such Substitute Collateral Obligations have the same or a higher S&P Rating as the Collateral Obligation that produced such Unscheduled Principal Proceeds or Sale Proceeds or (B) for so long as any Rated Notes by S&P are outstanding, the S&P CDO Monitor SDR is no greater following such reinvestment;
(i) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test is satisfied after giving effect to such reinvestment;
(j) after giving effect to such reinvestment, not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are CCC Obligations; and
(k) after giving effect to such reinvestment, not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount shall consist of obligations which are Caa Obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt, Sale Proceeds from the sale of Defaulted Obligations may not be reinvested following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period. Following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, any Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and any Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Improved Obligations and Credit Risk Obligations that have not been reinvested as provided above prior to the end of the Due Period in which such proceeds were received shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payment on the following Payment Date (subject as provided at the end of this paragraph), save that the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may in its discretion procure that Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Credit Improved Obligations or Credit Risk Obligations are paid into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, in which case such Principal Proceeds shall not be so disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments for so long as they remain so designated for reinvestment; provided that, in each case where any of the applicable Reinvestment Criteria are not satisfied as of the Payment Date next following receipt of such Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, all such funds shall be paid into the Principal Account and disbursed in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments set out in Condition 3(c)(ii) (Application of Principal Proceeds) and such funds shall be applied only in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
Unsaleable Assets

Notwithstanding the other requirements set forth herein and in the Trust Deed, on any Business Day after the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, may conduct an auction on behalf of the Issuer of Unsaleable Assets in accordance with the procedures described in this paragraph provided that no such auction shall take place unless a redemption of the Notes in full in accordance with the Conditions is contemplated or scheduled to occur within three months of such auction. Promptly after receipt of written notice from the Collateral Manager of such auction, the Principal Paying Agent will provide notice (in such form as is prepared by the Collateral Manager) to the Noteholders of an auction, setting forth in reasonable detail a description of each Unsaleable Asset and the following auction procedures: (i) any Noteholder may submit a written bid within 10 Business Days after the date of such notice to purchase one or more Unsaleable Assets no later than the date specified in the auction notice (which will be at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice); (ii) each bid must include an offer to purchase for a specified amount of cash on a proposed settlement date no later than 20 Business Days after the date of the auction notice; (iii) if no Noteholder submits such a bid within the time period specified under clause (i) above, unless the Collateral Manager determines that delivery in kind is not legally or commercially practicable and provides written notice thereof to the Principal Paying Agent, the Principal Paying Agent will provide notice (in a form to be prepared by the Collateral Manager) thereof to each Noteholder (in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) and the Collateral Manager shall offer to deliver (at such Noteholder’s expense) a pro rata portion (as determined by the Collateral Manager) of each unsold Unsaleable Asset to the Noteholders or beneficial owners of the most senior Class of Notes that provide delivery instructions in writing to the Collateral Administrator on or before the date specified in such notice, subject to minimum denominations; provided that, to the extent that minimum denominations do not permit a pro rata distribution, the Collateral Administrator will distribute the Unsaleable Assets on a pro rata basis to the extent possible and the Collateral Manager will select by lottery the Noteholder or beneficial owner to whom the remaining amount will be delivered and deliver written notice thereof to the Collateral Administrator; provided, further, that the Collateral Administrator will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect delivery of such interests; and (iv) if no such Noteholder or beneficial owner provides delivery instructions to the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Administrator will promptly notify the Collateral Manager and offer to deliver (at the cost of the Collateral Manager) the Unsaleable Asset to the Collateral Manager. If the Collateral Manager declines such offer, the Collateral Administrator will take such action as directed by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) in writing to dispose of the Unsaleable Asset, which may be by donation to a charity, abandonment or other means. For the avoidance of doubt, any sale or delivery or other transfer or disposal of an Unsaleable Asset in the circumstances contemplated in this paragraph shall not affect the Principal Amount Outstanding of any Notes.
Amendments to Collateral Obligations

The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may vote in favour of a Maturity Amendment only if, after giving effect to such Maturity Amendment:
(a) the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of the Collateral Obligation that is the subject of such Maturity Amendment is not later than the Maturity Date of the Rated Notes; and
(b) the Weighted Average Life Test is satisfied.
If the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements above but by way of scheme of arrangement or otherwise, the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity has been extended, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may but shall not be required to sell such Collateral Obligation or treat such Collateral Obligation as a Defaulted Obligation, save that the Collateral Manager shall be required to treat such Collateral Obligation as a Defaulted Obligation if on any Measurement Date, the aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations which have been subject to this proviso exceeds the Maturity Amendment Threshold.
If the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) has not voted in favour of a Maturity Amendment which would contravene the requirements of this paragraph but by way of scheme of arrangement or otherwise, the Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity has been extended, the Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may but shall not be required to sell such Collateral Obligation provided that in any event the Collateral Manager shall dispose of such Collateral Obligation prior to the Maturity Date. Such proceeds shall constitute Sale Proceeds and may be reinvested in accordance with and subject to the Reinvestment Criteria.
Expiry of the Reinvestment Criteria Certification

Immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager will deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator a schedule of Collateral Obligations purchased by the Issuer with respect to which purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and will certify to the Trustee that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including, for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Principal Account, any scheduled distributions of Principal Proceeds, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Issuer from the sale of Collateral Obligations for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Obligations.
Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test

On and after the Effective Date during the Reinvestment Period, if, on any Payment Date during such period after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Priority of Payments, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test has not been satisfied, then on the related Payment Date, Interest Proceeds in an amount (such amount, the “Required Diversion Amount”) equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (V) of the Interest Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to the payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Priority of Payments would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be satisfied shall be paid, at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) (i) into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds; or (ii) in redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence.
Designation for Reinvestment

After the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager shall, one Business Day following each Determination Date, notify the Issuer and the Collateral Administrator in writing of all Principal Proceeds which the Collateral Manager determines in its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer, and subject to the terms of Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as described above) shall remain designated for reinvestment in accordance with the Reinvestment Criteria, on or after the following Payment Date in which event such Principal Proceeds shall not constitute Principal Proceeds which are to be paid into the Payment Account and disbursed on such Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.
The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may direct that the proceeds of sale of any Collateral Obligation which represents accrued interest be designated as Interest Proceeds and paid into the Interest Account save for: (i) Purchased Accrued Interest; (ii) any interest received in respect of any Mezzanine Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Deferring Mezzanine Obligation other than Defaulted Mezzanine Excess Amounts; and
(iii) any interest received in respect of a Defaulted Obligation for so long as it is a Defaulted Obligation other than Defaulted Obligation Excess Amounts.
Accrued Interest

Amounts included in the purchase price of any Collateral Obligation comprising accrued interest thereon may be paid from the Interest Account or the Principal Account at the discretion of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) but subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and Condition 3(j) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Due Period, all payments of interest and proceeds of sale received during such Due Period in relation to any Collateral Obligation, in each case, to the extent that such amounts represent accrued and/or capitalised interest in respect of such Collateral Obligation (including, in respect of a Mezzanine Obligation, any accrued interest which, as at the time of purchase, had been capitalised and added to the principal amount of such Mezzanine Obligation in accordance with its terms), which was purchased at the time of acquisition thereof with Principal Proceeds shall constitute “Purchased Accrued Interest” and shall be deposited into the Principal Account as Principal Proceeds.
Block Trades

The requirements described herein with respect to the Portfolio shall be deemed to be satisfied upon any sale and/or purchase of Collateral Obligations on any day in the event that such Collateral Obligations satisfy such requirements in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria at the election of the Collateral Manager acting in a commercially reasonable manner, any proposed investment (whether a single Collateral Obligation or
a group of Collateral Obligations) identified by the Collateral Manager as such at the time (the “Initial Trading Plan Calculation Date”) when compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria is required to be calculated (a “Trading Plan”) may be evaluated after giving effect to all sales and reinvestments proposed to be entered into within the 10 Business Days following the date of determination of such compliance (such period, the “Trading Plan Period”); provided that:
(a) no Trading Plan may result in the purchase of Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance that exceeds 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (for which purposes the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lesser of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) as of the first day of the Trading Plan Period;
(b) no Trading Plan Period may include a Determination Date;
(c) no more than one Trading Plan may be in effect at any time during a Trading Plan Period;
(d) if the Reinvestment Criteria are satisfied prospectively after giving effect to a Trading Plan, but are not satisfied upon the completion of the related Trading Plan, Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P is obtained with respect to the effectiveness of additional Trading Plans (it being understood that Rating Agency Confirmation from S&P shall only be required once following any failure of a Trading Plan); and
(e) no Trading Plan may be entered into following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period if (i) the differential between the shortest and the longest maturity of the related Collateral Obligations is greater than 3 years or (ii) any of the related Collateral Obligations have a Collateral Obligation Stated Maturity of fewer than 6 months,
provided that no Trading Plan may result in the averaging of the purchase price of a Collateral Obligation or Collateral Obligations purchased at separate times for purposes of determining whether any particular Collateral Obligation is a Discount Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria, where a particular criterion in the Reinvestment Criteria only applies to one or some, but not all, of the Collateral Obligations in a Trading Plan, (a) that criterion shall apply to the relevant Collateral Obligation(s) only, (b) only those Collateral Obligations shall be aggregated for the purpose of calculating compliance with that criterion, and (c) the other Collateral Obligations in the Trading Plan shall not be taken into consideration for the purposes of calculating compliance with that criterion.
Eligible Investments

The Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may from time to time purchase Eligible Investments out of the Balances standing to the credit of the Accounts (other than the Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account(s), the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account and the Payment Account). For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Investments may be sold by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) at any time.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations

The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may, from time to time, purchase Collateral Enhancement Obligations independently or as part of a unit with the Collateral Obligations being so purchased provided that such Collateral Enhancement Obligation may not constitute a Dutch Ineligible Security.
All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time or by means of a Collateral Manager Advance. Pursuant to Condition 3(j)(v) (Supplemental Reserve Account), such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise amounts which the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations may be sold at any time and all Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds received by the Issuer shall be deposited into the Principal Account for allocation in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments.
Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests, Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test or Collateral Quality Tests.
Exercise of Warrants and Options

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may at any time exercise a warrant or option attached to a Collateral Obligation or comprised in a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and shall on behalf of the Issuer instruct the Account Bank to make any necessary payment pursuant to a duly completed form of instruction.
Margin Stock

The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement requires that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavours to sell any Collateral Obligation, Exchanged Security or Collateral Enhancement Obligation which is or at any time becomes Margin Stock as soon as practicable following such event.
“Margin Stock” means margin stock as defined under Regulation U issued by the Federal Reserve Board, including any debt security which is by its terms convertible into Margin Stock.
Non-Euro Obligations

The Collateral Manager shall be authorised to purchase, on behalf of the Issuer, Non-Euro Obligations from time to time provided that any such Non-Euro Obligation shall only constitute a Collateral Obligation that satisfies paragraph (b) of the Eligibility Criteria if not later than the settlement of the purchase by the Issuer of such Collateral Obligation, the Collateral Manager procures entry by the Issuer into a Currency Hedge Transaction pursuant to which the currency risk arising from receipt of cash flows from such Non-Euro Obligations, including interest and principal payments, is hedged through the swapping of such cash flows for Euro payments to be made by a Currency Hedge Counterparty. The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) shall be authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction. Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in relation to entry into each Currency Hedge Transaction unless such Currency Hedge Transaction is a Form Approved Hedge. See the “Hedging Arrangements” section of this Offering Circular.
Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may acquire Collateral Obligations which are Revolving Obligations or Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations from time to time.
Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may only be acquired if they are capable of being drawn in a single currency only (being Euros) and are not payable in or convertible into another currency.
Each Revolving Obligation and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation will, pursuant to its terms, require the Issuer to make one or more future advances or other extensions of credit (including extensions of credit made on an unfunded basis pursuant to which the Issuer may be required to reimburse the provider of a guarantee or other ancillary facilities made available to the obligor thereof in the event of any default by the obligor thereof in respect of its reimbursement obligations in connection therewith). Such Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations may or may not provide that they may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time by the Obligor thereunder. Upon acquisition of any Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations, the Issuer shall deposit into the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account amounts equal to the combined aggregate principal amounts of the Unfunded Amounts under each of the Revolving Obligations and Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligations. To the extent required, the Issuer, or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf, may direct that amounts standing to the credit of the Unfunded Revolver Reserve Account be deposited with a third party from time to time as collateral for any reimbursement or indemnification obligations owed by the Issuer to any other lender in connection with a Revolving Obligation or a Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation, as applicable and upon receipt of an Issuer Order by the Collateral Administrator (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) the Trustee shall be deemed to have released such amounts from the security granted thereover pursuant to the Trust Deed.
Participations

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Participation provided that at the time such Participation is taken:
(a) the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with a single Selling Institution will not exceed the percentages set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the credit rating of such third party (or any guarantor thereof); and
(b) the percentage of the Collateral Principal Amount that represents Participations entered into by the Issuer with Selling Institutions (or any guarantor thereof), each having the same credit rating (taking the lowest rating assigned thereto by any Rating Agency), will not exceed the aggregate third party credit exposure limit set forth in the Bivariate Risk Table for such credit rating,
and, for the purpose of determining the foregoing, account shall be taken of each sub participation from which the Issuer, directly or indirectly, derives its interest in the relevant Collateral Obligation.
Each Participation entered into pursuant to a sub-participation agreement shall be substantially in the form of:
(a) the LSTA Model Participation Agreement for par/near par trades (as published by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Inc. from time to time);
(b) the LMA Funded Participation (Par) (as published by the Loan Market Association from time to time); or
(c) such other documentation (including the Forward Purchase Agreement),
provided such agreement contains limited recourse and non-petition language substantially the same as that set out in the Trust Deed.
Assignments

The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from Selling Institutions by way of Assignment provided that at the time such Assignment is acquired the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall have complied, to the extent within their control, with any requirements relating to such Assignment set out in the relevant loan documentation for such Collateral Obligation (including, without limitation, with respect to the form of such Assignment and obtaining the consent of any person specified in the relevant loan documentation).
“Assignment” means an interest in a loan acquired directly by way of novation or assignment.
Bivariate Risk Table

The following is the bivariate risk table (the “Bivariate Risk Table”) and as referred to in “Portfolio Profile Tests” below and “Participations” above. For the purposes of the limits specified in the Bivariate Risk Table, the individual third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Participations (excluding any Defaulted Obligations) entered into by the Issuer with the same counterparty (such amount in respect of such entity, the “Third Party Exposure”) and the applicable percentage limits shall be determined by reference to the lower of the S&P or Moody’s ratings applicable to such counterparty and the aggregate third party credit exposure limit shall be determined by reference to the aggregate of Third Party Exposure of all such counterparties which share the same rating level or have a lower rating level, as indicated in the Bivariate Risk Table.

“Senior Secured Floating Rate Note” means any obligation that (a) constitutes borrowed money, (b) is in the form of, or represented by, a bond, note (other than any note evidencing a loan), certificated debt security or other debt security, (c) is expressly stated to bear interest based upon an interbank offered rate for deposits in the relevant currency and in the relevant location or a relevant reference bank’s published base rate or prime rate for obligations denominated in the relevant currency and in the relevant location, (d) does not constitute and is not secured by, Margin Stock, (e) if it is subordinated by its terms, is subordinated only to indebtedness for borrowed money, trade claims, capitalised leases or other similar obligations, or no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or stock, provided that a revolving loan of the Obligor that, pursuant to its terms, may require one or more future advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or stock in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loan representing up to 15 per cent. of the Obligor’s senior debt (or more if Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained) and (f) is secured by a valid first priority perfected security interest or lien in, to or on specified collateral securing the obligor’s obligations under such obligation.
The percentage requirements applicable to different types of Collateral Obligations specified in the Portfolio Profile Tests shall be determined by reference to the Aggregate Principal Balance of such type of Collateral Obligations (with each Defaulted Obligation carried at its Market Value multiplied by its respective Principal Balance (other than (p) and (q) of the Portfolio Profile Tests for which each Defaulted Obligation will be carried at zero)). Obligations for which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to purchase but have not yet settled shall be included for the purposes of calculating the Portfolio Profile Tests and obligations for which the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the
Issuer) has entered into binding commitments to sell, but have not yet settled, shall be excluded for the purposes of the Portfolio Profile Tests.
Further, for the purposes of calculating compliance with the Portfolio Profile Tests:
(a) in the case of sub-paragraphs (c) to (cc) (inclusive) thereof, each relevant percentage shall be rounded down to the nearest 0.1 per cent.; and
(b) in the case of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) thereof, the relevant percentage shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.1 per cent.
Collateral Quality Tests

The Collateral Quality Tests will consist of each of the following:
(a) so long as any Notes rated by Moody’s are Outstanding:
(i) the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test;
(ii) the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test; and
(iii) the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test;
(b) so long as any Rated Notes rated by S&P are Outstanding, (until the expiry of the Reinvestment Period only) the S&P CDO Monitor Test;
(c) so long as any Rated Notes are Outstanding:
(i) the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test; and
(ii) the Weighted Average Life Test,
each as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Moody’s Test Matrix

Subject to the provisions provided below, on or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will have the option to elect which of the cases set forth in the Moody’s test matrix set out below (the “Moody’s Test Matrix”) shall be applicable for purposes of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test. For any given case:
1. the applicable column for performing the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test will be the column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent columns, as applicable) in which the elected case is set out;
2. the applicable row and column for performing the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test will be the row and column (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)) in which the elected case is set out; and
3. the applicable row for performing the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test will be the row (or linear interpolation between two adjacent rows, as applicable) in which the elected test is set out.
On or after the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager will be required to elect which case shall apply initially. Thereafter, on two Business Days’ notice to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and Moody’s, the Collateral Manager may elect to have a different case apply, provided that the Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test, the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test, the Moody’s Minimum Weighted Average Recovery Rate Test and the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test applicable to the case to which the Collateral Manager desires to change are satisfied or, in the case of any tests that are not satisfied, are closer to being satisfied. In no event will the Collateral Manager be obliged to elect to have a different case apply. The Moody’s Test Matrix may be amended and/or supplemented and/or replaced by the Collateral Manager subject to Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s and the consent of the Controlling Class acting by Ordinary Resolution.

Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test

The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score equals or exceeds the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):
(a) an “Average Principal Balance” is calculated by summing the Obligor Principal Balances and dividing by the sum of the aggregate number of issuers and/or borrowers represented;
(b) an “Obligor Principal Balance” is calculated for each Obligor represented in the Collateral Obligations by summing the Principal Balances of all Collateral Obligations (excluding Defaulted Obligations) issued by such Obligor, provided that if a Collateral Obligation has been sold or is the subject of an optional redemption or Offer, and the Sale Proceeds or Unscheduled Principal Proceeds from such event have not yet been reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations or distributed to the Noteholders or the other creditors of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the Obligor Principal Balance shall be calculated as if such Collateral Obligation had not been sold or was not subject to such an optional redemption or Offer;
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;
(d) an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is then calculated for each of the 32 Moody’s industrial classification groups by summing the Equivalent Unit Scores for each Obligor in the industry (or such other industrial classification groups and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time); and
(e) an “Industry Diversity Score” is then established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.

Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test

The “Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor as at such Measurement Date is equal to or less than the sum of (i) the number set forth in the Moody’s Test Matrix at the intersection of the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)), (acting on behalf of the Issuer) as at such Measurement Date plus (ii) the Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment, provided, however, that the sum of (i) and (ii) may not exceed 3580.
The “Moody’s Weighted Average Rating Factor” is determined by summing the products obtained by multiplying the Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation, excluding Defaulted Obligations, by its Moody’s Rating Factor, dividing such sum by the Aggregate Principal Balances of all such Collateral Obligations, excluding Defaulted Obligations, and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number.
The “Moody’s Rating Factor” relating to any Collateral Obligation is the number set forth in the table below opposite the Moody’s Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Obligation.

The “Moody’s Weighted Average Recovery Adjustment” means, as of any Measurement Date, the greater of:
(a) zero; and
(b) the product of:
(i) (A) the Weighted Average Moody’s Recovery Rate as of such Measurement Date multiplied by 100 minus

(B) 44.5; and
(ii) (A) with respect to the adjustment of the Moody’s Maximum Weighted Average Rating Factor Test:
(1) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 2.40 per cent. but less than 2.50 per cent., 50;
(2) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 2.50 per cent. but less than 2.60 per cent., 70;
(3) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 2.60 per cent. but less than 3.00 per cent., 65;
(4) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 3.00 per cent. but less than 4.20 per cent., 75;
(5) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 4.20 per cent. but less than 4.60 per cent., 80;
(6) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 4.60 per cent. but less than 5.20 per cent., 85; and
(7) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to 5.20 per cent. but less than 5.60 per cent., 90;
(8) in all other cases, 95; and
(B) with respect to adjustment of the Minimum Weighted Average Spread Test:
(1) if the Weighted Average Spread (expressed as a percentage) is (I) greater than or equal to 2.40 per cent. but less than 2.60 per cent. or (II) greater than or equal to 2.80 per cent. but less than 3.30 per cent., 0.060 per cent.;

“Moody’s Default Probability Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Obligation, as of any date of determination, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then such CFR;
(b) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Assigned Moody’s Rating on such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(c) if not determined pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above, if the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior secured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is one subcategory lower than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such senior secured obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(d) if not determined pursuant to clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, if a rating estimate has been assigned to such Collateral Obligation by Moody’s upon the request of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager, then the Moody’s Default Probability Rating is such rating estimate as long as such rating estimate or a renewal for such rating estimate has been issued or provided by Moody’s in each case within the 15 month period preceding the date on which the Moody’s Default Probability Rating is being determined; provided, that if such rating estimate has been issued or provided by Moody’s for a period (x) longer than 13 months but not beyond 15 months, the Moody’s Default Probability Rating will be one subcategory lower than such rating estimate and (y) beyond 15 months, the Moody’s Default Probability Rating will be deemed to be “Caa3”;
(e) if not determined pursuant to clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Moody’s Derived Rating; and
(f) if not determined pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Default Probability Rating of “Caa3”.
For purposes of calculating a Moody’s Default Probability Rating, each applicable rating on credit watch by Moody’s with positive or negative implication at the time of calculation will be treated, respectively, as having been upgraded or downgraded by one rating subcategory, as the case may be.
“Assigned Moody’s Rating” means the monitored publicly available rating or the monitored estimated rating or the unpublished monitored loan rating, in each case expressly assigned to a debt obligation (or facility) by Moody’s that addresses the full amount of the principal and interest promised.
“CFR” means, with respect to an obligor of a Collateral Obligation, if such obligor has a corporate family rating by Moody’s, then such corporate family rating; provided, if such obligor does not have a corporate family rating by Moody’s but any entity in the obligor’s corporate family does have a corporate family rating, then the CFR is such corporate family rating.
“Moody’s Derived Rating” means, with respect to a Collateral Obligation whose Moody’s Rating or Moody’s Default Probability Rating is determined as the Moody’s Derived Rating, the rating as determined in the manner set forth below:
(a) with respect to any Corporate Rescue Loan and (solely for purposes of determining the Adjusted Weighted Average Moody’s Rating Factor) any Current Pay Obligation, the Moody’s Rating or Moody’s Default Probability Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be the rating which is one subcategory below the facility rating (whether public or private) of such Corporate Rescue Loan or Current Pay Obligation, as applicable, rated by Moody’s;
(b) if not determined pursuant to clause (a) above, then by using any one of the methods provided below:
(i) pursuant to the table below:
Type of Collateral Obligation
‎
S&P Rating (Public and Monitored)
‎
Collateral Obligation Rated by S&P
‎Number of Subcategories Relative to Moody’s Equivalent of S&P Rating
Not Structured Finance Obligation
Not Structured Finance Obligation
Not Structured Finance Obligation
‎
≥ “BBB-“ Not a Loan or -1 Participation Interest in
Loan
≤ “BB+” Not a Loan or -2 Participation Interest in
Loan
Loan or Participation-2 Interest in Loan
(ii) if such Collateral Obligation is not rated by S&P but another security or obligation of the obligor has a public and monitored rating by S&P (a “parallel security”), then the rating of such parallel security will at the election of the Collateral Manager be determined in accordance with the table set forth in sub-clause (b)(i) above, and the Moody’s Derived Rating for purposes of the definitions of Moody’s Rating and Moody’s Default Probability Rating (as applicable) of such Collateral Obligation will be determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in the following table (for such purposes treating the parallel security as if it were rated by Moody’s at the rating determined pursuant to this sub-clause (b)(ii)):
Obligation Category of parallel security
‎Rating of parallel security
‎Number of subcategories relative to rated security rating

Senior secured obligationgreater than or equal -1
to B2
Senior secured obligationless than B2 -2
Subordinated obligationgreater than or equal +1
to B3
Subordinated obligationless than B3 0
(iii) or, if such Collateral Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan, no Moody’s Derived Rating may be determined based on a rating by S&P or any other rating agency; provided, that the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations that may have a Moody’s Rating derived from an S&P Rating as set forth in sub-clauses (i) or (ii) of this clause (b) may not exceed 10 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount; and
(c) if not determined pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above and such Collateral Obligation is not rated by Moody’s or S&P and no other security or obligation of the issuer of such Collateral Obligation is rated by Moody’s or S&P, and if Moody’s has been requested by the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the issuer of such Collateral Obligation to assign a rating or rating estimate with respect to such Collateral Obligation but such rating or rating estimate has not been received, pending receipt of such estimate, the Moody’s Derived Rating of such Collateral Obligation for purposes of the definitions of Moody’s Rating or Moody’s Default Probability Rating shall be (i) “B3” if the Collateral Manager certifies to the Collateral Administrator that the Collateral Manager believes that such estimate shall be at least “B3” and if the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations determined pursuant to this clause (c)
and clause (a) above does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount or (ii) otherwise, “Caa1”.
“Moody’s Rating” means:
(a) with respect to a Collateral Obligation that is a Secured Senior Loan or a Secured Senior Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Obligation has an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Assigned Moody’s Rating;
(ii) if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then the Moody’s rating that is one subcategory higher than such CFR;
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is two subcategories higher than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(iv) if none of clauses (i) through (iii) above apply, at the election of the Collateral Manager, the Moody’s Derived Rating;
(v) if none of clauses (i) through (iv) above apply, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Rating of “Caa3”; and
(b) with respect to a Collateral Obligation other than a Secured Senior Loan or a Secured Senior Bond:
(i) if such Collateral Obligation has an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Assigned Moody’s Rating;
(ii) if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more senior unsecured obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor (ii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has a CFR, then the Moody’s rating that is one subcategory lower than such CFR;
(iv) if none of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above apply, if such Collateral Obligation does not have an Assigned Moody’s Rating but the obligor of such Collateral Obligation has one or more subordinated debt obligations with an Assigned Moody’s Rating, then the Moody’s rating that is one subcategory higher than the Assigned Moody’s Rating on any such obligation as selected by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion;
(v) if none of clauses (i) through (iv) above apply, at the election of the Collateral Manager, the Moody’s Derived Rating; and
(vi) if none of clauses (i) through (v) above apply, the Collateral Obligation will be deemed to have a Moody’s Rating of “Caa3”.
S&P Ratings Definitions

The “S&P Rating” means, with respect to any Collateral Obligation, as of any determination date, the rating determined in accordance with the following methodology:
(a) if there is an issuer credit rating of the issuer of such Collateral Obligation by S&P as published by S&P, or the guarantor which unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such Collateral Obligation pursuant to a form of guarantee that satisfies the criteria set forth therefore by S&P for use in connection with this transaction, then the S&P Rating shall be such rating (regardless of whether there is a published rating by S&P on the Collateral Obligations of such issuer held by the Issuer, provided that private ratings (that is, ratings provided at the request of the Obligor) may be used for purposes of this definition if the related Obligor has consented to the disclosure thereof and a copy of such consent has been provided to S&P);
(b) if there is no issuer credit rating of the issuer or guarantor by S&P but,
(i) there is a senior secured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be one sub-category below such rating;
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, but there is a senior unsecured rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall equal such rating; and
(iii) if neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) above applies, but there is a subordinated rating on any obligation or security of the issuer, then the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be one sub-category above such rating;
(c) with respect to any Collateral Obligation that is a Current Pay Obligation, the S&P Rating applicable to such obligation shall be the issue level rating thereof and if there is no such issue level rating, the S&P rating applicable to such Current Pay Obligation shall be “CCC-”;
(d) with respect to any Collateral Obligation that is a Corporate Rescue Loan:
(i) falling within sub-paragraph (a) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if (x) S&P has assigned a public rating to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such public rating or (y) if no public rating is assigned by S&P to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating shall be such credit estimate; or
(ii) falling within sub-paragraph (b) of the definition of Corporate Rescue Loan, and if S&P has assigned an S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate to such Corporate Rescue Loan, the S&P Rating for such Corporate Rescue Loan shall be such S&P Issuer Credit Rating or credit estimate; or
(iii) upon application by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) to S&P for a credit estimate, the applicable Corporate Rescue Loan shall be deemed to have an S&P Rating of “D”;
(e) if there is not a rating by S&P on the issuer or on an obligation of the issuer, then the S&P Rating may be determined (other than in the case of Corporate Rescue Loans) pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) below:
(i) if an obligation of the issuer is not a Corporate Rescue Loan and is publicly rated by Moody’s, then the S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodology for establishing the S&P Rating for such obligation, but by reference to the Moody’s equivalent ratings, except that the S&P Rating of such obligation will be (A) one sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Baa3” or higher and (B) two sub-categories below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating if such Moody’s rating is “Ba1” or lower, provided that in each case, (1) the S&P Rating will be a further sub-category below the S&P equivalent of the Moody’s rating of the applicable obligation if the relevant Moody’s rating is on “credit watch negative” by Moody’s; and (2) if the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations whose S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) exceeds 15 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation will be its S&P Collateral Value), the S&P Rating of any Collateral Obligations comprising such excess shall be “CCC-” provided that (i) (other than with respect to Restructured Obligations) neither the Obligor of such Collateral Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy, reorganisation or similar proceedings; and (ii) (other than with respect to Restructured Obligations) the Collateral Obligation is current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects such Collateral Obligation to remain current (for the purposes of this paragraph (e)(i)(2), the Collateral Obligations whose S&P Rating is determined pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i) with the lowest S&P Collateral Value (expressed as a percentage of the Principal Balance of such Collateral Obligation as of the relevant date of determination) shall be determined to comprise such excess); and
(ii) the S&P Rating may be based on a credit estimate provided by S&P, and in connection therewith, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer or the issuer of such Collateral Obligation shall, prior to or within 30 days after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, apply (and concurrently submit all available information in respect of such
application) to S&P for a credit estimate which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, if such information is submitted within such 30-day period, then, for a period of up to 90 days after acquisition of such Collateral Obligation by the Issuer and pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating as determined by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion if (A) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator that it believes that such S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager is commercially reasonable and that the S&P Rating, will be at least equal to such rating and (B) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations subject to an S&P Rating determined by the Collateral Manager in accordance with (A) does not exceed 5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount (for which purpose, the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation will be its S&P Collateral Value); provided further that (x) if such information is not submitted within such 30-day period and (y) following the end of the 90-day period set forth above, pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, the Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-”; unless, in the case of clause (y) above, during such 90-day period, the Collateral Manager has requested the extension of such period and S&P, in its sole discretion, has granted such request; provided further that if the Collateral Obligation has had a public rating by S&P that S&P has withdrawn or suspended within six months prior to the date of such application for a credit estimate in respect of such Collateral Obligation, the S&P Rating in respect thereof shall be “CCC-” pending receipt from S&P of such estimate, and S&P may elect not to provide such estimate until a period of six months have elapsed after the withdrawal or suspension of the public rating; provided further that such credit estimate shall expire 12 months after the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation, following which such Collateral Obligation shall have an S&P Rating of “CCC-” unless, during such 12-month period, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) applies for renewal thereof in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in which case such credit estimate shall continue to be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation until S&P has confirmed or revised such credit estimate, upon which such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall be the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation; provided further that such confirmed or revised credit estimate shall expire on the next succeeding 12-month anniversary of the date of the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation and (when renewed annually in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement) on each 12-month anniversary thereafter; or
(iii) with respect to a Collateral Obligation that is not a Defaulted Obligation, the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation will at the election of the Issuer (at the direction of the Collateral Manager) be “CCC-”; provided that (i) neither the issuer of such Collateral Obligation nor any of its Affiliates are subject to any bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings; (ii) the issuer has not defaulted on any payment obligation in respect of any debt security or other obligation of the issuer at any time within the two year period ending on such date of determination and all such debt securities and other obligations of the issuer are current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects them to remain current; and (iii) the Collateral Obligation is current and the Collateral Manager reasonably expects it to remain current,
provided that, in respect of each of (a) to (e) above, (x) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch positive” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category above such assigned rating, (y) if the applicable rating assigned by S&P to an Obligor or its obligations is on “credit watch negative” by S&P, such rating will be treated as being one sub-category below such assigned rating and
(z) only ratings assigned on the basis of ongoing surveillance (including any rating assigned by Moody’s) will be applicable for the purposes of determining the S&P Rating of a Collateral Obligation.
The Coverage Tests
The Coverage Tests will consist of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class E Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test, the Class D Interest Coverage Test and the Class E Interest Coverage Test. The Coverage Tests will be used primarily to determine whether interest may be paid on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, whether Principal Proceeds may be reinvested in Substitute Collateral Obligations, or whether Interest Proceeds which would otherwise be used to pay interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes must instead be used to pay principal on the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence, in each case to the extent necessary to cause the Coverage Tests relating to the relevant Class of Notes to be met.
Each of the Class A/B Par Value Test, the Class A/B Interest Coverage Test, the Class C Par Value Test, the Class C Interest Coverage Test, the Class D Par Value Test, the Class D Interest Coverage Test, the Class E Par Value Test and the Class E Interest Coverage Test shall apply on a Measurement Date and shall be satisfied on a Measurement Date in the case of (i) on and after the Effective Date in respect of the Par Value Tests, on and after the Issue Date and (ii) the Interest Coverage Tests, on and after the Determination Date preceding the second Payment Date, if the corresponding Par Value Ratio or Interest Coverage Ratio (as the case may be) is at least equal to the percentage specified in the table below in relation to that Coverage Test. There are no Coverage Tests in respect of the Class X Notes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
The following description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not defined in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
General
The Collateral Manager will perform certain investment management functions, including, without limitation, supervising and directing the investment and reinvestment of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments, and perform certain administrative and advisory functions on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains procedures whereby the Collateral Manager will have discretionary authority of the Issuer in relation to the composition, acquisition and management of the Portfolio.
Standard of Care of the Collateral Manager
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will agree with the Issuer that it will perform its obligations, duties and exercise its discretions under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, in good faith and exercise a standard of care which the Collateral Manager (and its Affiliates) exercises with respect to comparable assets and liabilities that it manages for itself and others (if any), in each case a manner which is consistent with practices and procedures generally followed by prudent institutional investment managers of international standing managing investments or advising in respect of assets and liabilities similar in nature and character to those which comprise the Collateral except as otherwise expressly provided in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed (the “Standard of Care”). To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the Collateral Manager will follow its customary and usual administrative policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Collateral Manager is exempted from liability arising out of or in connection with the performance of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement except, inter alia, by reason of acts or omissions constituting a breach of the Standard of Care, negligence or wilful misconduct of the Collateral Manager.
Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall be entitled to reasonably rely and act in good faith on the written advice of counsel and public accountants, selected in good faith with reasonable care, experienced in the matter at issue with respect to legal and accounting matters, respectively, and any advice from such counsel or public accountants shall provide full and complete authorisation (so long as such advice does not conflict with the terms hereof), shall be deemed to constitute satisfaction by the Collateral Manager of the Standard of Care applicable thereunder and shall entitle the Collateral Manager to the protections from liability set out therein in respect of any action taken or omitted by it in relation to the management of the Collateral in which it reasonably relied and acted in good faith thereon.
Liability of Collateral Manager
Without prejudice to provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement summarised below under “Indemnity by the Collateral Manager” below, neither the Collateral Manager nor any Collateral Manager Related Person will be liable to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the holders of the Notes or any beneficial interests therein, or any other Person for any losses, claims, damages, judgments, assessments, costs, expenses or other liabilities incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the holders of the Notes or any beneficial interests therein, or any other Person that arise out of or in connection with the Transaction Documents, including performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement except by reason of acts or omissions constituting a Collateral Manager Breach (as defined below). The Collateral Manager shall not be liable for any consequential or punitive losses or damages.
In exercising its powers and duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall not be responsible for any failure to take any action, effect any transaction or make any recommendations whatsoever in relation to any part of the Portfolio if such failure was upon the instructions of the Issuer or the Trustee.
Indemnity by the Collateral Manager

Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager (or as the case may be, each other Collateral Manager Related Person) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer and its managing directors, officers, stockholders, partners, agents and controlling persons (each, a “Collateral Manager Indemnified Person”) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, assessments, costs, taxes or other liabilities whatsoever (collectively, “Liabilities”), arising in connection with an act or omission that constitutes a Collateral Manager Breach, and shall reimburse each such Collateral Manager Indemnified Person for all such Liabilities caused by, or arising out of or in connection with, any such act or omission (including fees and expenses of counsel). The Collateral Manager will undertake to the Issuer that it shall pay to the Issuer any amount payable to any Collateral Manager Indemnified Person under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or, if directed by the Issuer, to the person in respect of which the relevant Liability has arisen, which payment shall be in satisfaction of such amount payable.
The Collateral Manager indemnification described herein shall not apply when a Collateral Manager Indemnified Person engages in any act or omission constituting negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
Without prejudice to the indemnity described above, the Collateral Manager shall assume no responsibility under or pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement other than to render the services called for thereunder and, subject to the Standard of Care and in any event, shall not be responsible for any decision of the Issuer and/or the Trustee. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement provides that the Collateral Manager shall incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, settlement, notice, resolution, request, direction, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be properly authorised, executed or signed by the proper party or parties. The Collateral Manager, its directors, members, officers, Affiliates, stockholders, partners, agents and employees, shall not be liable (whether directly or indirectly, in contract or in tort or otherwise) to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other Person for Liabilities incurred by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or such other Person that arise out of or in connection with the performance by the Collateral Manager of its duties under or pursuant to the Transaction Documents (including any Hedge Transaction) except nothing shall relieve the Collateral Manager from Liabilities it may have: (i) by reason of acts or omissions constituting a breach of the Standard of Care, fraud, negligence or wilful misconduct of the Collateral Manager in the performance of its obligations thereunder; and/or (ii) with respect to the Collateral Manager Information (as defined in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement), if such information contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make statements contained in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The matters described in (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred to as “Collateral Manager Breaches” and each individually, a “Collateral Manager Breach”.
Indemnity by the Issuer
Subject to the limited recourse and non-petition provisions contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer will agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates, their directors, members, officers, stockholders, partners, agents and employees (each such party, an “Issuer Indemnified Person”) from and against any and all Liabilities, and will reimburse each Issuer Indemnified Person for all such Liabilities and documented fees and expenses (including documented fees and expenses of counsel but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, taxation) (collectively, the “Expenses”) as such Expenses are incurred in investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any claim, action, proceeding or investigation with respect to any pending or threatened litigation (collectively, the “Actions”), (i) caused by the entry into and the performance by the Collateral Manager of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, including, without limitation, any pecuniary sanctions to which the Collateral Manager may become liable pursuant to Article 32 of the Securitisation Regulation including any pecuniary sanctions arising due to the Issuer’s negligence or intentional infringement (ii) any action taken by, or any failure to act by, such Issuer Indemnified Person; provided, however, that no Issuer Indemnified Person shall be indemnified for any Liabilities or Expenses it incurs as a result of any acts or omissions by any Issuer Indemnified Person constituting Collateral Manager Breaches.
Compensation of the Collateral Manager
As compensation for the performance of its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will be entitled to receive from the Issuer on each Payment Date a senior collateral management fee equal to 0.15 per cent. per annum (calculated semi-annually in respect of each semi- annual Due Period following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and quarterly at all other times and, in each case, on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed in such Due Period) of the Collateral Principal Amount measured as of the first day of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next day which is a Business Day) relating to the applicable Payment Date, which collateral management fee will be payable senior to the Notes, but subordinated to certain fees and expenses of the Issuer in accordance with the Priorities of Payment (such fee, the “Senior Management Fee”).
The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement provides that the Collateral Manager will receive from the Issuer on each Payment Date a subordinated collateral management fee equal to 0.35 per cent. per annum (calculated semi-annually in respect of each semi-annual Due Period following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event and quarterly at all other times and, in each case, on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed in such Due Period) of the Collateral Principal Amount measured as of the first day of the Due Period relating to the applicable Payment Date (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next day which is a Business Day) immediately preceding such Payment Date, as determined by the Collateral Administrator, which collateral management fee will be payable senior to the payments on the Subordinated Notes, but subordinated to the Rated Notes (such fee, the “Subordinated Management Fee”).
Each of the Senior Management Fee and the Subordinated Management Fee shall be calculated based upon the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Due Period divided by 360 and, subject to the following, on a VAT exclusive basis. In the event that the Senior Management Fee and/or the Subordinated Management Fee constitute (in whole or in part) consideration for a supply by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer for VAT purposes, VAT is or becomes chargeable on such supply and the Collateral Manager is required to account to the relevant tax authority for that VAT, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager in addition to, and at the same time, as paying such Senior Management Fee and/or Subordinated Management Fee (and the Collateral Manager shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to the Issuer), provided that the Collateral Manager may agree to bear and not receive amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Senior Management Fee and/or the Subordinated Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT).
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee, as applicable, equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment. Any due and unpaid Collateral Management Fees shall not accrue any interest.
The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement also provides that the Collateral Manager will be entitled to an Incentive Collateral Management Fee on each Payment Date on which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold has been met or surpassed, such fee being in an amount equal to and payable from 20 per cent. of any Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds that would otherwise be available to distribute to the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and, subject to the following, calculated on a VAT exclusive basis. In the event that the Incentive Collateral Management Fee constitutes (in whole or in part) consideration for a supply by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer for VAT purposes, VAT is or becomes chargeable on such supply and the Collateral Manager is required to account to the relevant tax authority for that VAT, then an amount equal to such VAT will be paid by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager in addition to, and at the same time, as paying such Incentive Collateral Management Fee (and the Collateral Manager shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to the Issuer), provided that the Collateral Manager may agree to bear and not receive amounts in respect of such VAT (so that the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is paid inclusive of VAT).
The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement provides that any extraordinary expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager in the performance of the obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement will be reimbursed by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with and subject to the limitations contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Priorities of Payment. Those extraordinary expenses include (i) any reasonable expenses incurred by it to employ outside lawyers or consultants reasonably necessary in connection with the evaluation, transfer, or restructuring of any Collateral Obligation and any reasonable expenses incurred by it in obtaining
advice from counsel (including Dutch counsel) with respect to its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and (ii) any other reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the evaluation, acquisition, carrying, and disposition of the Collateral Obligations, but excluding any such counsel fees and expenses, not otherwise ordered by any court, incurred in connection with any dispute between the Collateral Manager and the Trustee or any Noteholder.
Termination of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement
Subject to the paragraph below, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may be terminated, and the Collateral Manager may be removed, upon the occurrence of a Collateral Manager Event of Default (other than pursuant to paragraph (vii) of the definition thereof) (i) at the Issuer’s discretion; (ii) by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) by holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by Extraordinary Resolution (in each case, excluding Class X Notes, CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, CM Non-Voting Notes and Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person) upon 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, each Hedge Counterparty and the Collateral Administrator.
The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the payment in full of the Notes, in accordance with their terms, (ii) the liquidation of the Portfolio and the final distribution of the proceeds of such liquidation as provided in the Transaction Documents, and (iii) the determination in good faith by the Issuer that the Issuer or the Portfolio has become required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and the Issuer notifies the Collateral Manager thereof.
Resignation
The Collateral Manager may resign, upon at least 45 days’ written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, each Hedge Counterparty and each Rating Agency (or upon such shorter notice as is acceptable to the Issuer). Any such resignation is without prejudice and subject to fulfilment of the Collateral Manager’s obligations in respect of the Retention Notes (unless the same are subsequently transferred in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement (as described herein)).
Appointment of Successor
Upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). If the Collateral Manager resigns, or is removed, the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor by delivering notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. The Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may, within 30 days from receipt of such notice, object to such Eligible Successor by delivery of notice of such objection to the Issuer and the Trustee. If the Controlling Class object as described in the previous sentence, then the Controlling Class, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, shall propose an alternative replacement collateral manager which shall be appointed a successor provided the holders of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution) do not object within 30 days after having been given notice thereof. If no such Eligible Successor has been appointed and approved within 90 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor. If (i) such successor Collateral Manager agrees in writing to assume all of the Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and (ii) the Issuer has not received written objections from the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) within 45 days of such proposal, the Issuer will appoint such proposed Eligible Successor upon the expiration of such 45 day period. If no Eligible Successor has been appointed within 135 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor without any approval or veto right of any Noteholder (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). For the avoidance of doubt, no Class X Notes, Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes or held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall have any voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for
the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting any CM Replacement Resolution or with respect to the selection or appointment of the successor Collateral Manager following a CM Removal Resolution.
“Eligible Successor” means an established institution (1) that has demonstrated an ability to professionally and competently perform duties similar to those imposed upon the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with a substantially similar (or better) level of expertise, (2) that is legally qualified and has the Dutch regulatory capacity to act as Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in the assumption of all of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of the Collateral Manager under the applicable terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the Trust Deed, (3) the appointment of which will not cause either of the Issuer or the Portfolio to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, (4) the appointment and conduct of which will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation or to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes or cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer, (5) that, on the effective date of any appointment accepts a transfer of the Retention Notes if such transfer is required under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and (6) the appointment of which is in compliance with the restrictions set out in, and does not cause, directly or indirectly, the transaction to be non-compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
Upon notice of removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager
In the event that the Collateral Manager has received notice that it will be removed or has given notice of its resignation, until a successor Collateral Manager has been appointed and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the terms specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, purchases and sales of Collateral Obligations shall be only made in relation to sale of Margin Stock, Credit Risk Obligations and Defaulted Obligations (in addition to any purchase or sale trades initiated prior to such removal, termination or resignation).
Delegation and Transfers
Save as provided below and save for the delegation of signing authority to agent banks in connection with amendments to the terms of Collateral Obligations, the performance of any of its duties either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the delegation of certain day-to-day discretions relating to the composition of the portfolios of the Issuer and the authority to execute transactions for the Issuer to AML described in “Description of the Collateral Manager”, the obligations of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may not be delegated, in whole or in part, except to an Affiliate that is legally qualified and has the requisite Dutch regulatory capacity to provide such services to residents in The Netherlands as a matter of Dutch law and provided that without the prior written consent of the Issuer such appointment and conduct of which will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Collateral Management Fees becoming subject to value added or similar tax or otherwise cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding any such consent, no delegation of duties by the Collateral Manager shall relieve it from any liability under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as set out below.
The Issuer acknowledges and agrees in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement that certain day-to-day discretions relating to the composition of the Portfolio as well as authority to execute transactions for the Issuer will be delegated to Ares Management Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Management LLC. In addition, Ares Management Limited will: (i) perform certain middle- and back-office functions for the Collateral Manager; (ii) make available certain individuals to perform certain functions for the Collateral Manager; and (iii) provide the Collateral Manager with certain intellectual property licences, however no such delegation by the Collateral Manager shall relieve it from any liability under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
The Collateral Manager may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement subject to the prior written consent of the Issuer and receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof and provided that the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by Ordinary Resolution) have not objected to such assignment or transfer within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice thereof, in each case excluding any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person, Class X Notes and any Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes, and subject to such assignee having the requisite Dutch regulatory capacity; provided, that, to the extent permitted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, such consent and Rating Agency Confirmation and
where such assignment and/or transfer is in respect of a Retention Cure Action, the right of the Subordinated Noteholders to object (acting by Ordinary Resolution) shall not be required or, as the case may be, shall not apply, in the case of a Permitted Assignee. A “Permitted Assignee”, for the purposes of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, means an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager that (i) is legally qualified and has the Dutch regulatory capacity to act as Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement; (ii) has the ability to professionally and competently perform duties similar to those imposed upon the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with a substantially similar (or better) level of expertise; (iii) the appointment of which will not cause either of the Issuer or the Collateral to become required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act; (iv) the appointment and conduct of which will not cause the Issuer to be subject to net income taxation outside its jurisdiction of incorporation, be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, result in the Collateral Management Fees becoming subject to value added or similar tax or cause any other material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer (v) notice of such assignment or transfer is given to the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator and the Trustee; and (vi) the appointment and conduct of which will not cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
The Issuer may not assign its rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement without the prior written consent of the Collateral Manager, the holders of each Class of Notes (excluding holders of Class X Notes and any holders of CM Non-Voting Notes and CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes) acting by Ordinary Resolution, each voting as a separate Class, and subject to Rating Agency Confirmation, except in the case of an assignment by the Issuer (i) to an entity that is a successor to the Issuer permitted under the Trust Deed or (ii) to the Trustee.
In the event of any assignment, delegation or transfer by a party to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the assignee, delegate or transferee shall execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary to effect fully such assignment, delegation or transfer and the assignee, delegate or transferee shall be required to make all the representations, mutatis mutandis, as set out therein as on the date of assignment, delegation or transfer, provided that the relevant party thereto will not thereby be relieved of any of its duties or obligations which arose prior to such assignment, delegation or transfer in respect of the Retention Notes (other than if the Retention Notes are transferred in accordance with the terms thereof and of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement as described herein) or otherwise unless the assignee, delegate and/or transferee agrees in writing with all other parties to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to assume such duties or obligations. Any assignment, delegation or transfer made in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement shall bind the assignee, delegate or transferee in the same manner as the relevant party who is the transferor or assignor is bound. In addition, in the case of an assignment or delegation by the Collateral Manager, the assignee or delegate shall execute and deliver to the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and the Rating Agencies then rating the Rated Notes a counterpart of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement naming such assignee or delegate as the Collateral Manager (with or without any changes to or omission of the provisions relating to the Retention Notes as may be required in accordance with the terms of such provisions). Upon the execution and delivery of such a counterpart by the assignee or delegate, the Collateral Manager shall be released from further obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, except with respect to its agreements and obligations arising under various sections of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to such assignment or delegation and except with respect to its obligations under certain provisions relating to confidentiality, limited recourse and non-petition and only if the Retention Notes have not been transferred to the assignee or delegate in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, in respect of the Retention Notes. Any rights of the Collateral Manager stated to survive the termination of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement shall remain vested in the Collateral Manager after the termination in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.
No Voting Rights
Notes held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes shall not have any voting rights in respect of, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions (but shall carry a right to vote and be so counted on all other matters in respect of which the CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted).
Any Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person shall only be held in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and will therefore have no voting rights with respect to and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Removal
Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution (but shall carry a right to vote and be so counted on all other matters in respect of which CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted).
EU RETENTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
The information appearing in this section consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and in particular is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.

The Retention Holder

The Collateral Manager, in its capacity as Retention Holder, will hold the Retention Notes (as defined below) in its capacity as “sponsor” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements as of the Issue Date.
The Collateral Manager may in its sole discretion, having retained the Retention Notes in its capacity as “sponsor” as of the Issue Date pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and having determined that a Retention Compliance Event has occurred (or, with the passage of time, is reasonably likely to occur) following the Issue Date, take any Retention Cure Action which may include, but is not limited to, qualifying as an “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, subject to: (i) internal approval of the Retention Cure Action in accordance with the Collateral Manager’s internal policies and procedures and (ii) receipt of legal advice from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, DLA Piper UK LLP or other reputable legal counsel as selected in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion that such Retention Cure Action is consistent with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).
Although no assurance can be given that the Collateral Manager would qualify as an “originator” for such purposes, the Collateral Manager reasonably believes that (i) were it not to retain as a “sponsor” as described above, it would qualify as an “originator” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and in particular that (ii) the Originator Requirement (as defined below) would be met.
“Originator Requirement” means the requirement which will be satisfied if, on the Issue Date:
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Originated Assets that have been originated by the Collateral Manager; divided by
(b) the Target Par Amount,
is greater than or equal to 5.0 per cent.
“Originated Assets” means (i) Limb (a) Originator Assets (as defined below) and/or (ii) Limb (b) Originator Assets (as defined below).
The Retention
The Collateral Manager will, on the Issue Date, for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee (for the benefit of the Secured Parties including the Noteholders) and the Initial Purchaser, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, for so long as any Notes are Outstanding:
(a) undertake to continue to hold and to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the first loss tranche of not less than 5 per cent. of the nominal value of the securitised exposures through the purchase and retention of Subordinated Notes with an original Principal Amount Outstanding (such original Principal Amount Outstanding calculated as of the date of issuance of such Subordinated Notes including the date of any issuance of additional Subordinated Notes) multiplied by the price at which such Subordinated Notes were purchased by the Retention Holder being equal to or greater than 5 per cent. of the greater of the Target Par Amount and the Collateral Principal Amount on the relevant date of determination within the meaning of Article 6(3)(d) of the Securitisation Regulation, in effect on the Issue Date (the “Retention Notes”);
(b) agree that neither it nor a CM Affiliate shall sell, hedge or otherwise mitigate its credit risk under or associated with the Retention Notes, subject as provided below;
(c) subject to any regulatory requirements, agree (i) to provide any reports, data and other information on a confidential basis (unless otherwise required by applicable law or regulation), as may be reasonably required by the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation and (ii) to provide to the Issuer, on a confidential basis (unless otherwise required by applicable law or regulation) information in the possession of the Collateral Manager relating to its holding of the Retention Notes, at the cost and expense of the party seeking such information, and to the extent the same is not subject to a duty of confidentiality, at any time prior to maturity of the Notes;
(d) agree to confirm its continued compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above:
(i) on a monthly basis to the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and Initial Purchaser (concurrent with the delivery of each Monthly Report); and
(ii) promptly upon the request of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, Initial Purchaser or Issuer, its continued compliance with the covenants set out at paragraphs (a) and (b) above;
(e) agree that it shall promptly notify the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator in writing if for any reason it (i) ceases to hold the Retention Notes in accordance with (a) above or (ii) fails to comply with the covenants set out in (b) or (c) in any material way;
(f) represent and warrant that it is a “sponsor” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and, for so long as it is required to retain the Retention Notes, will continue to retain the Retention Notes pursuant to paragraph (a) above and in accordance with paragraph (b) above in such capacity provided that (i) if any Retention Compliance Event occurs which would render this representation and warranty inapplicable or (ii) if there is any change in the Collateral Manager’s authorisation or licensing status such that it ceases to be a “sponsor” for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements following the Issue Date solely as a direct consequence of any Retention Compliance Event, this representation and warranty shall no longer apply; and
(g) represent and warrant, inter alia, that to the extent it retains as an originator:
(i) the Originator Requirement has been satisfied on the Issue Date and that the Collateral Manager has “established” and is “managing” (as such terms are used in Article 3(4)(a) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 625/2014) the transaction as contemplated by the Transaction Documents; and
(ii) it was not established and does not operate for the sole purpose of securitising exposures, taking into consideration that:
(X) it has a business strategy and the capacity to meet payment obligations consistent with a broader business enterprise and involving material support from capital, assets, fees or other income available to it, relying neither on the exposures it securitises, nor on any interests retained in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation, as well as any corresponding income from such exposures and interests; and
(Y) its responsible decision makers have the required experience to enable it to pursue it established business strategy, as well as an adequate corporate governance arrangement.
Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may transfer its interest in the Retention Notes to the extent such transfer is (i) in compliance with any applicable laws, (ii) permitted or required in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements and (iii) would not cause the transaction described in the Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
If a successor Collateral Manager is appointed as described in “Appointment of Successor” in the section “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”, then notwithstanding the above, the Collateral Manager may sell the Retention Notes to such successor (at a price agreed by the parties to such sale) other than if and to the extent such a sale:
(a) is restricted by the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements; or
(b) would cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements,
and such successor shall, by way of entry into of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement commit to acquire and retain the Retention Notes and provide representations, warranties and covenants substantially similar to those set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in relation to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
If a successor Collateral Manager is appointed as described in “Appointment of Successor” in the section “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” and the outgoing Collateral Manager does not sell the Retention Notes, such outgoing Collateral Manager shall continue to be bound by the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in respect of the Retention Notes and such provisions shall not apply to such successor.
“CM Affiliate” means a direct parent of the Collateral Manager and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Collateral Manager’s direct parent.
Origination of Collateral Obligations
The Issuer has accurately reproduced the information contained in the section entitled “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations” from information provided to it by the Collateral Manager but it has not independently verified such information. So far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by the Collateral Manager, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. The information appearing in this section has been prepared by the Collateral Manager and has not been independently verified by the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser or any other party and none of such Persons assumes any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or applicability of such information. The delivery of this Offering Circular shall not create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Collateral Manager or of its Affiliates since the date of this Offering Circular, or that the information contained or referred to herein is correct as of any time subsequent to the date of this Offering Circular.

The Collateral Manager, or one of its related entities, may originate Collateral Obligations in order to meet the Originator Requirement as described above by virtue of having the opportunity to comment on and approve the terms of Collateral Obligations (“Limb (a) Originator Assets”) prior to the execution of the related transaction documents as part of the primary syndication process of such Limb (a) Originator Assets. In these circumstances the Collateral Manager will have received from the syndication agent a term sheet or draft documentation and will have been able to review and provide input (and will have actually provided such input) on the terms of the credit as part of its decision to participate in the syndication; shall have reviewed the underlying business of the Obligor including its financial status and overall debt structure; and undertake a credit analysis of the underlying Obligor and loan.
Origination under Limb (b) of the Definition of Originator

The Collateral Manager may also cause the Issuer to acquire certain assets for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of “originator” under the Securitisation Regulation which are intended to form part of the Collateral Obligations (“Limb (b) Originator Assets”), pursuant to a conditional sale agreement (“Conditional Sale Agreement”) between the Collateral Manager (as purchaser) and the Issuer (as seller) under which the Issuer shall, in the event any such Limb (b) Originator Asset becomes a Defaulted Obligation within 15 Business Days of the date upon which the Collateral Manager entered into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation from the Issuer pursuant to such Conditional Sale Agreement, have the right to require the Collateral Manager to complete the purchase from it of the relevant Limb (b) Originator Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Limb (b) Originator Asset.
The Collateral Manager shall have absolute discretion to acquire, hold and/or sell assets at any time and, if appropriate, shall also have absolute discretion to nominate any asset which is proposed to be acquired from the Issuer pursuant to the arrangements described above.
Comparable Assets

In the event that the Collateral Manager holds the Retention Notes in its capacity as “originator” as described above, it will not select assets to be transferred to the Issuer for the purposes of meeting the Originator
Requirement detailed above with the aim of rendering losses on the assets transferred to the Issuer higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on its balance sheet.
Credit Granting Criteria

The Collateral Manager shall apply the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting which it applies to non-securitised exposures and shall have effective systems in place to ensure that such credit granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor’s credit worthiness including taking appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the obligor meeting its obligations under the credit agreement. In the event that the Collateral Manager holds the Retention Notes in its capacity as “originator” as described above, It will also, as part of its due diligence on any Limb (b) Originator Assets to be securitised for the purposes of meeting the Originator Requirement detailed above in respect of which it has not undertaken the original credit-granting, verify to the extent required pursuant to Article 9(3) that the entity directly or indirectly involved in the original agreement which created such asset, has met the foregoing credit-granting requirements in respect in respect of such Originated Asset.
Transparency Requirements
In accordance with Article 7(2) of the Securitisation Regulation, each of the originator, the sponsor and the Issuer are required to designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the reporting obligations of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer has agreed to be the designated entity.
The Collateral Manager shall, subject to any regulatory requirements, undertake, on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer, at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation requires, to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the designated entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities, the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, the Issuer intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”). Following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports, data and other information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available (or procure that such information is made available) via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager and as further notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies (substantially in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form which may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator from time to time) (which certificate may be given electronically and upon which certificate the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is a competent authority, a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes (and in such other manner as required by any competent authority (as instructed to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator)). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer in making available such information and reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral
Administrator will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for the use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.
In connection with such information and reporting, the Collateral Manager will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders, and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.

HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS
The following section consists of a summary of certain provisions which, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, are required to be contained in each Hedge Agreement and/or Hedge Transaction. Such summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of each Hedge Agreement and Hedge Transaction. The terms of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction may differ from the description provided herein, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof or without Rating Agency Confirmation if such Hedge Transaction constitutes a Form Approved Hedge.
Hedge Agreements
As of the Issue Date, the Issuer has entered into Currency Hedge Transactions in respect of a portion of the Portfolio.
Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into transactions documented under a 1992 (Multicurrency - Cross Border) Master Agreement, 2002 Master Agreement or such other form published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). Each Hedge Transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to a Hedge Agreement.
Each Hedge Transaction will be for the purposes of:
(a) in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction, hedging any interest rate mismatch between the Rated Notes and the Collateral Obligations; and
(b) in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction, exchanging payments of principal, interest and other amounts in respect of any Non-Euro Obligation for amounts denominated in Euros at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate,
in each case subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (save in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and provided that the Hedge Counterparty satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement (taking into account any guarantor thereof) and any applicable regulatory requirements.
If the relevant counterparty criteria of a Rating Agency changes following the receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation or approval of a Form Approved Hedge, as applicable, the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) may be required to seek a further Rating Agency Confirmation or approval in respect of any new Hedge Transaction and/or Hedge Agreement, as applicable.
The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) may purchase a Non-Euro Obligation provided that the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, enters, no later than the settlement of the purchase by the Issuer of such Collateral Obligation of such Non-Euro Obligation, into a Currency Hedge Transaction (to become effective on or before the settlement of the purchase by the Issuer of such Collateral Obligation) with a Currency Hedge Counterparty pursuant to the terms of which the initial principal exchange is made to fund the Issuer’s acquisition of the related Non-Euro Obligation and the final and, if applicable, interim principal exchanges are made to convert into Euros the principal proceeds received in respect thereof at maturity and prior to maturity, respectively, and coupon exchanges are made at the exchange rate specified for such transaction.
For the avoidance of doubt, the ability of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf to enter into any Currency Hedge Transactions, and therefore the ability of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf to acquire Non-Euro Obligations, is subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition.
Replacement Hedge Transactions
Currency Hedge Transactions: In the event that any Currency Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time other than in circumstances where the Collateral Manager intends to sell the related Non-Euro Obligation on behalf of the Issuer or a Redemption Date has or is scheduled to occur or the applicable Currency Hedge Counterparty is the “Defaulting Party” or sole “Affected Party” (each as defined in the applicable Currency Hedge Agreement), the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to enter into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction within 30 days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or the guarantor of which) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
Interest Rate Hedge Transactions: In the event that any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction terminates in whole at any time in circumstances in which the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty is the Defaulting Hedge Counterparty or sole “Affected Party” (each as defined in the applicable Interest Rate Hedge Agreement), the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to enter into a replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction within 30 days of the termination thereof with a counterparty which (or whose guarantor) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and any applicable regulatory requirements.
Standard Terms of Currency Hedge Transactions
Any Currency Hedge Transaction shall contain the following terms (provided that the Issuer may enter into Currency Hedge Transactions on different terms than those set forth below, subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof or such Currency Hedge Transaction being a Form Approved Hedge):
(a) on the effective date of entry into such transaction, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an initial exchange amount in Euros equal to the purchase price of such Non-Euro Obligation, converted into Euros at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of an initial exchange amount in the relevant currency equal to the purchase price of such Non-Euro Obligation;
(b) on the scheduled date of termination of such transaction, which shall be the date falling two Business Days after the date on which the Non-Euro Obligation is scheduled to mature or such later date as otherwise specified in the relevant confirmation, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty a final exchange amount equal to the amount payable upon maturity of the Non-Euro Obligation in the relevant currency (the “Proceeds on Maturity”) in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of a final exchange amount denominated in Euros, such final exchange amount to be an amount equal to the Proceeds on Maturity converted into Euros at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate;
(c) two Business Days following the date of each scheduled payment of interest on the related Non-Euro Obligation or such later date as otherwise specified in the relevant confirmation, the Issuer pays to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an amount in the relevant non-Euro currency based on the then outstanding principal amount of the relevant Non-Euro Obligation (the “Non-Euro Notional Amount”) and equal to the interest payable in respect of the Non-Euro Obligation and the Currency Hedge Counterparty will pay to the Issuer an amount based on the then outstanding principal amount of the related Non-Euro Obligation and equal to the interest payable in respect of the Non-Euro Obligation converted into Euros at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate or equal to a floating amount linked to an agreed index rate for Euro-denominated cashflows (the “Euro Notional Amount”); and
(d) following the sale of any Non-Euro Obligation, the Issuer shall pay to the Currency Hedge Counterparty an amount equal to the sale proceeds of such Non-Euro Obligation in the relevant currency (the “Proceeds on Sale”) in exchange for payment by the Currency Hedge Counterparty of an amount denominated in Euros, such amount to be an amount equal to the Proceeds on Sale converted into Euros at the Currency Hedge Transaction Exchange Rate less in certain cases any amounts payable to the Currency Hedge Counterparty in respect of the early termination of the Currency Hedge Agreement.
The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, shall convert all amounts received by it in respect of any Non-Euro Obligation which is not the subject of a related Currency Hedge Transaction into Euros promptly upon receipt thereof at the then prevailing Spot Rate and shall procure that such amounts are paid into the Principal Account or the Interest Account, as applicable. The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is also authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction.
All amounts received by the Issuer in respect of Non-Euro Obligations shall be paid into the appropriate Currency Account and all amounts payable by the Issuer under any Currency Hedge Transaction (other than any initial exchange amounts payable in Euros by the Issuer, any Hedge Replacement Payments and any Currency Hedge Issuer Termination Payments save to the extent otherwise provided in Condition 3(j)(viii) (Currency Accounts)), will be paid out of the appropriate Currency Account, in each case to the extent amounts are available therein.
Subject to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement, the Issuer shall only pay Scheduled Periodic Currency Hedge Issuer Payments to a Currency Hedge Counterparty if and to the extent it actually receives the corresponding amount in respect of the relevant Non-Euro Obligation.
Upon the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), and upon the Trustee (or any agent or appointee thereof), the Collateral Manager or any other agent of the Issuer (including any insolvency practitioner, receiver or equivalent such person in any relevant jurisdiction), selling the relevant Non-Euro Obligation, the Currency Hedge Counterparty shall receive the proceeds of the sale of the Non-Euro Obligation from the Currency Account of the Issuer, outside of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and return the Euro equivalent amount owing, less any amount payable to the Currency Hedge Counterparty in respect of the early termination of the Currency Hedge Transaction in connection with such sale and the Currency Hedge Transaction shall terminate in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding the above, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Currency Hedge Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, terminate any or all Currency Hedge Transactions in which case any Currency Hedge Issuer Termination Payment would be paid (following acceleration of the Notes) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) and the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments.
Standard Terms of Hedge Agreements
Each Hedge Agreement entered into by or on behalf of the Issuer shall contain the following standard provisions, save to the extent that any change thereto is agreed by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and subject to receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in respect of any Form Approved Hedges).
Gross up

Under each Hedge Agreement, each of the Issuer and the applicable Hedge Counterparty shall represent that payments made by it under such Hedge Agreement (other than default interest) will not be subject to withholding tax, other than withholding tax imposed as a result of a connection between the jurisdiction imposing the withholding tax and the recipient of the payment or a related person). The Issuer will not be obliged to gross up any payments thereunder, however, the applicable Hedge Counterparty may in certain circumstances be obliged to gross up a payment thereunder in the event of any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax required to be paid on such payments, provided certain Hedging Arrangements may provide that any withholding for or on account of FATCA may be excluded from such gross up obligation. Any such event may however result in a “Tax Event” which is a “Termination Event” for the purposes of the relevant Hedge Agreement. In the event of the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined in such Hedge Agreement), each Hedge Agreement will include provision for the relevant Affected Party (as defined therein) to use reasonable endeavours to (i) (in the case of the Hedge Counterparty) arrange for a transfer of all of its interests and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions (as defined in the Hedge Agreement) thereunder to an Affiliate that is incorporated in another jurisdiction so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax; or (ii) (in the case of the Issuer) transfer its residence for tax purposes to another jurisdiction or if a substitute principal obligor under the Notes has been substituted for the Issuer in accordance with Condition 9 (Taxation), arrange for a transfer of all of its interest and obligations under the Hedge Agreement and all Transactions thereunder to that substitute principal obligor so as to avoid the requirement to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax subject to satisfaction of the conditions specified therein (including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation).
Limited Recourse and Non-Petition

The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment); provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non- Petition).
Termination Provisions

Each Hedge Agreement may terminate by its terms, whether or not the Notes have been paid in full prior to such termination, upon the earlier to occur of certain events, which may include but are not limited to:
(a) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganisation of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty;
(b) failure on the part of the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to make any payment under the applicable Hedge Agreement after taking into account the applicable grace period;
(c) a change in law making it illegal for either the Issuer or the related Hedge Counterparty to be a party to, or perform its obligations under, the applicable Hedge Agreement;
(d) in certain circumstances, upon a regulatory change or a change in the regulatory status of the Issuer, as further described in the relevant Hedge Agreement;
(e) representations related to certain regulatory matters prove to be incorrect when made;
(f) any amendment to any provisions of the Transaction Documents without the written consent of the Hedge Counterparty which would have a material adverse effect on its rights thereunder, or as further described in the relevant Hedge Agreement;
(g) failure by a Hedge Counterparty to comply with the requirements of the Rating Agencies in the event that it (or, as relevant, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement;
(h) upon the early redemption in full or acceleration of the Notes; and
(i) any other event as specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement.
Hedge Agreements commonly also contain provisions which allow a Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of certain events or restructurings related to the underlying Non-Euro Obligation. These events could potentially be triggered in circumstances where the related Collateral Obligation would not constitute a Defaulted Obligation.
A termination of a Hedge Agreement or Hedge Transaction does not constitute a Note Event of Default under the Notes though the repayment in full of the Notes may be an additional termination event under a Hedge Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of any Note Event of Default or Termination Event (each as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement), a Hedge Agreement may be terminated by the Hedge Counterparty or the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with the detailed provisions thereof and a lump sum (the “Termination Payment”) may become payable by the Issuer to the applicable Hedge Counterparty or vice versa. Depending on the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement, such Termination Payment may be determined by the applicable Hedge Counterparty and/or Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) by reference to market quotations obtained in respect of the entry into a replacement swap(s) on the same terms as that terminated or as otherwise described in the applicable Hedge Agreement or any loss suffered by a party, subject to and in accordance with the relevant Hedge Agreement.
Rating Downgrade Requirements

Each Hedge Agreement will contain provisions requiring certain remedial action to be taken in the event that the Hedge Counterparty (or, as relevant, its guarantor) is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade, such provisions being in accordance with the rating methodology of the Rating Agencies at the time of entry into such Hedge Agreements. Such provisions may include a requirement that a Hedge Counterparty must post collateral or transfer the Hedge Agreement to another entity (or, as relevant, its guarantor) meeting the applicable Rating Requirement or procure that a guarantor meeting the applicable Rating Requirement guarantees its obligations under the Hedge Agreement or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation.
Transfer and Modification

The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may not modify any Hedge Transaction or Hedge Agreement without Rating Agency Confirmation in relation to such modification, save to the extent that it would constitute a Form Approved Hedge following such modification. A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.
Governing Law

Each Hedge Agreement together with each Hedge Transaction thereunder, in each case including any non- contractual obligations arising out of or in relation thereto, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with English Law.
Reporting of Specified Hedging Data
The Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, may from time to time enter into agreements (each a “Reporting Delegation Agreement”) for the delegation of certain derivative reporting obligations to one or more Hedge Counterparties or third parties (each, in such capacity, a “Reporting Delegate”).

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

1. General

Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.
POTENTIAL PURCHASERS ARE WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THEIR OWN TAX POSITION IN RESPECT OF THE NOTES. POTENTIAL PURCHASERS WHO ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THEIR TAX POSITION ON PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER OR EXERCISE OF ANY NOTE SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS. IN PARTICULAR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES WOULD BE CHARACTERISED BY ANY RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY. POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE RELEVANT FISCAL RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION MAY CHANGE, POSSIBLY WITH RETROSPECTIVE EFFECT, AND THAT THIS SUMMARY IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE. THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE OR A GUARANTEE TO ANY POTENTIAL INVESTOR OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTING IN THE NOTES.
2. Netherlands Taxation
The comments below are of a general nature based on taxation law and practice in The Netherlands as at the date of this Offering Circular and are subject to any changes therein, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and does not purport to describe all possible tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder of Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as holders that are subject to taxation in Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba or trusts or similar arrangements) may be subject to special rules. The following is a general description of certain tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes and so should be treated with appropriate caution.
In particular, it does not take into consideration any tax implications that may arise on a substitution of the Issuer. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding and/or selling Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.
Investors should note that with respect to paragraph (b) below, the summary does not describe The Netherlands tax consequences for holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest or deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet Inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together with his/her partner (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5 per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of that company or of 5 per cent. or more of the issued and outstanding capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or (ii) holds rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest; or (iii) holds certain profit sharing rights in that company that relate to 5 per cent. or more of the company’s annual profits and/or 5 per cent. or more of the company’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest arises if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a non-recognition basis. Under the existing laws of The Netherlands:
(a) all payments of interest and principal by the Issuer under the Notes can be made free of withholding or deduction for any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by The Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein;
(b) a holder of a Note who is not a resident of The Netherlands and who derives income from a Note or who realises a gain on the disposal or redemption of a Note will not be subject to Dutch taxation on such income or capital gain, unless:
(i) the holder is deemed to be resident in The Netherlands;
(ii) such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is either effectively managed in The Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands; or
(iii) the holder is an individual and such income or gain qualifies as income from activities that exceed normal active portfolio management in The Netherlands;
(c) Dutch gift, estate or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the occasion of the transfer of a Note by way of gift by, or on the death of, a holder unless:
(i) the holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions; or
(ii) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or as a gift made by or on behalf of a person who, at the time of the gift or death, is, or is deemed to be, resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions;
(d) there is no Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in The Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the execution, delivery and/or enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of The Netherlands) of the Notes or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes;
(e) there is no Dutch VAT payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a Note; and
(f) a holder of a Note will not be treated as a resident of The Netherlands by reason only of the holding of a Note or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the Notes.
3. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations General
The following discussion summarises certain of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition of the Notes.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States, for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration, and one or more United States persons have the authority to control any of its substantial decisions.
For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:
 a non-resident alien individual for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 an estate whose income is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis; or
 a trust if no court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration or if no United States persons have the authority to control any of its substantial decisions.
An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).
This summary is based on interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes at initial issuance for cash (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as any alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to- market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes. Finally, this summary does not address holders of the Original Notes that acquiring the Refinancing Notes or the tax consequences to a Reinvesting Noteholder of a Reinvestment Amount.
Recent legislation may require a beneficial owner of a Note that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. Although the precise application of this rule is unclear, it might require the accrual of income earlier than is the case under the general tax rules described below. Prospective investors in Notes that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situations.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer
The Issuer is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection the issuance of the Original Notes on the Original Issue Date, the Issuer received an opinion of DLA Piper LLP to the effect that, although no activity closely comparable to that contemplated by the Issuer has been the subject of any Treasury regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision, if the Issuer and the Collateral Manager comply with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including certain tax guidelines referenced therein (the “U.S. Tax Guidelines”) , and certain other assumptions specified in the opinion are satisfied, the Issuer will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the U.S. Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer
could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Guidelines permit the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) to receive advice from nationally recognised U.S. tax counsel to the effect that any changes in its structure and operations will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP assumes the correctness of any such advice. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (notwithstanding that the Collateral Manager is acting in accordance with the
U.S. Tax Guidelines). Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If it is determined that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, possibly on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. Prospective purchasers of Refinancing Notes should be aware that there will not be a new tax opinion issued on the Issue Date with regard to whether the Issuer was or will be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. The balance of this summary assumes that the Issuer is not subject to
U.S. federal income tax on its net income.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP to the effect that, based on certain assumptions, the Class X Notes, Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes will be treated, and the Class E Notes should be treated, as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No opinion will be received with respect to the Class F Notes. The Issuer intends to treat each Class of the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes. The Issuer’s characterisations will be binding on all Noteholders, and the Trust Deed requires the Noteholders to treat the Rated Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that one or more Classes of Rated Notes are equity in the Issuer. If any Rated Notes were treated as equity in, rather than debt of, the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Noteholders of those Notes would be subject to the special and potentially adverse U.S. tax rules applicable to U.S. equity owners in PFICs or CFCs. See “Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes” below. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this summary assumes that all of the Rated Notes are treated as indebtedness of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Prospective investors in the Rated Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax consequences to the investors in the event their Rated Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
The Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that materially adversely affects the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes as described herein, including by affecting the
U.S. federal income tax characterization of the Notes as indebtedness or equity or changing the characterization and timing of income inclusions to U.S. Holders in respect of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion and the tax opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP assume that the Trust Deed is not so amended.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes
Class X Notes, Class A Notes and Class B Notes

Stated Interest. U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes and Class B Notes will include in gross income the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest accrued or received on their Notes, in accordance with their usual method of tax accounting, as ordinary interest income.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the cash method of accounting will calculate the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the time a payment is received.
In general, U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the accrual method of accounting or that otherwise are required to accrue stated interest before receipt will calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of such payments when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Original Issue Discount. In addition, if the discount at which a substantial amount of the Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes is first sold to investors is at least 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of the Class, multiplied by the number of complete years to the weighted average maturity of the Class, then the Issuer will treat the Class as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Note within the Class will equal the excess of the principal amount of the Note over its issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the Class was sold to investors). U.S. Holders of Notes that are issued with OID will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders of the Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that are issued with OID will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of the Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that are issued with OID can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to
U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes that are issued with OID also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of principal payments on their Class X Notes, Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the
U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in its Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by the U.S. dollar value of any such amount includable in income as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of payments of principal on such Note (based, in the case of a Class X Note, a Class A Note or a Class B Note, on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received).
A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class X Note, a Class A Note or Class B Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the
U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class X Note, a Class A Note or Class B Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement (less any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above) and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes

Original Issue Discount. The Issuer will treat the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note will equal the sum of all payments to be received under such Note less its issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors). U.S. Holders of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
A U.S. Holder of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, and Class F Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Payment Date, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Payment Date based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Payment Date and the assumed rate. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes should apply.
U.S. Holders of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest and/or principal payments on their Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the corresponding amounts of OID when they were accrued. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Sale, Exchange or Retirement. In general, a U.S. Holder of a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note will have a basis in such Note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired, or the settlement date for the purchase of the Note if the Note is treated under applicable Treasury regulations as a security traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder either uses the cash method of accounting, or uses the accrual method of accounting and so elects (which election must be applied consistently from year to year)), (i) increased by any amount includable in income by such U.S. Holder as OID (as described above), and (ii) reduced by the U.S. dollar value of any payments received on such Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payments were received). A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the
U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class C Note, Class D Note, Class E Note or Class F Note, a
U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. Any such gain or loss will be foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement (based on the euro- to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on such date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition. However, if the Notes are treated under applicable Treasury regulations as stock or securities traded on an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting, then the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised is based instead on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the settlement date for the disposition. U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances,
U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.
Alternative Characterisation

It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Holder’s OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
Receipt of Euro

U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes

As described above under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes,” the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, because the Issuer will be a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. dollar value of gain on the sale of the Class E Notes and/or the Class F Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and the U.S. dollar value of certain interest on such Notes could be subject to the additional tax. A U.S. Holder of such Notes might be able to avoid the ordinary income treatment and additional tax by writing “Protective QEF Election” on the top of an IRS Form 8621, filling out the form, checking Box A (Election to Treat the PFIC as a QEF) and filing the form with the IRS with respect to their Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, or by filing a protective statement with the IRS preserving the U.S. Holder’s ability to elect retroactively to treat the Issuer as a “qualified electing fund” (a “QEF”) and so electing at the appropriate time. The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the expense of the requesting U.S. Holder, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Class E Notes or Class F Notes is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to make and maintain a “protective” QEF election. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity, a U.S. Holder will also be required to file an annual PFIC report.
Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”), and a U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder would be subject to the potentially adverse rules applicable to a 10% U.S. shareholder in a CFC. Investors should consult their tax advisors as to the potential application of the PFIC rules and CFC rules to their situation.
If the Issuer holds any Collateral Obligations that are treated as equity in a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer,
U.S. Holders of Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be treated as owning an indirect equity interest in a PFIC or a CFC and could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences. In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC. Thus, there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder would be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such
purchase exceeds $100,000. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 926 with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
Finally, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer, a U.S. Holder of such Notes will be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the IRS if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may be required to provide additional information regarding the Issuer annually on IRS Form 5471 if the U.S. Holder is treated as owning (actually or constructively) more than 50 per cent. by value of the equity of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders may wish to file a “protective” IRS Form 5471 with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. Prospective U.S. Holders of Class E Notes and Class F Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding whether to make protective filings of IRS Forms 8621, 926 and 5471 with respect to such Notes and the consequences to them if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer.
Specified Foreign Financial Asset Reporting

Certain U.S. Holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other “specified foreign financial assets” (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds $50,000. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. Holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.
3.8 per cent. Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income”

U.S. Holders that are individuals or estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax and special rules apply with respect to the PFIC and CFC rules described above. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax.
FBAR Reporting

A U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes (or any Class of Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) may be required to file FinCEN Form 114 with respect to foreign financial accounts in which the Issuer has a financial interest if the U.S. Holder holds more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes or is otherwise treated as owning more than 50 per cent. of the total value or voting power of the Issuer’s outstanding equity.
Reportable Transactions

A participant in a “reportable transaction” is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders of Notes

In general, payments on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain realised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless (i) such income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of gain, such Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and
is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are satisfied.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Under certain circumstances, the Code requires “information reporting” annually to the IRS and to each holder, and “backup withholding”, with respect to certain payments made on or with respect to the Notes. Backup withholding will apply to a U.S. Holder only if the U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”) which, for an individual, would be his or her Social Security Number,
(ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report payments of interest and dividends, or (iv) under certain circumstances, fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments. The exemption generally is available to
U.S. Holders that provide a properly completed IRS Form W-9.
A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding.
Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of Notes made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be refunded (or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any), provided that certain required information is furnished. The information reporting requirements may apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Copies of the information returns also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-
U.S. Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.
FATCA

Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and The Netherlands, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Dutch implementing legislation that is expected to require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Dutch Tax Authorities (Belastingdienst), which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer expects to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the legislation. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Dutch implementing legislation could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.
If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes, and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes within 10 business days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Changes Affecting Noteholders

Future legislation, regulations, rulings or other authority could affect the federal income tax treatment of the Issuer and Noteholders. The Issuer cannot predict whether and to what extent any such legislative or administrative changes could change the tax consequences to the Issuer and to the Noteholders. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisors regarding possible legislative and administrative changes and their effect on the federal tax treatment of the Issuer and their investment in the Refinancing Notes.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR NOTEHOLDER. EACH PROSPECTIVE NOTEHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE REFINANCING NOTES UNDER THE NOTEHOLDER’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.
CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” subject thereto, on entities (such as collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts) the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of prudence, diversification, and that investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction. A Party in Interest who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code and the transaction may have to be rescinded at significant cost to the Issuer.
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, and applicable guidance (the “Plan Asset Regulation”)), if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets are deemed to include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established (a) that the entity is an “operating company,” as that term is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation, or
(b) that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity, disregarding the value of any equity interests held by persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) with discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity or who provide investment advice for a fee with respect to such assets (such as the Collateral Manager), and their respective Affiliates (each a “Controlling Person”), is held by Benefit Plan Investors (the “25 per cent. Limitation”). A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.
If the underlying assets of the Issuer are deemed to be Plan assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the Issuer, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the Issuer, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise parties in interest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers).
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features. Although it is not free from doubt, the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes offered hereby will be treated by the Issuer as indebtedness with no substantial equity features for purposes of ERISA. The treatment of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes as not being equity interests in the Issuer could, however, be affected, subsequent to their issuance, by certain changes in the structure or financial condition of the Issuer. However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and, to a greater extent, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain. The Issuer believes that the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes may and the Subordinated Notes will likely be considered “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. Accordingly, the Issuer intends to limit investments by Benefit Plan Investors in such Class E Notes, Class F
Notes and Subordinated Notes. In reliance on representations made by investors in the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes, the Issuer intends to limit investment by Benefit Plan Investors in each of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes to less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) at all times (excluding for purposes of such calculation the Class E Notes, Class F Notes and Subordinated Notes held by a Controlling Person). Each prospective purchaser (including a transferee) of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be required to make certain representations regarding its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and other ERISA matters as described under “Transfer Restrictions” below. No Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes will be sold or transferred to purchasers that have represented that they are Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons to the extent that such sale may result in Benefit Plan Investors owning 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed). Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Asset Regulation, each Class E Note, Class F Note and Subordinated Note held by persons that have represented that they are Controlling Persons will be disregarded and will not be treated as outstanding for purposes of determining compliance with such 25 per cent. Limitation.
Even assuming the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes are not treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, these classes and the other classes of Notes are subject to other restrictions and, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Such a prohibited transaction, however, may be subject to a statutory or administrative exemption. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain “in-house asset managers”). There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Even if an exemption were to apply, such exemption may not, however, apply to all of the transactions that could be deemed prohibited transactions in connection with an investment in the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor.
Each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates may be the sponsor of, or investment adviser with respect to one, or more, Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be acquired using the assets of any Plan if any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, a Collateral Manager Related Person or their respective Affiliates has investment authority with respect to such assets (except to the extent (if any) that a statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies or the transaction is not otherwise prohibited).
It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company, based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.
Each purchaser and transferee of a Class X Note, Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note or Class D Note or any interest in such Note will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (i) either (A) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds any such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (“Other Plan Law”), and no part of the assets to be used by it to acquire or hold such Note or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit
Plan Investor or such governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, or (B) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interests therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law, and (ii) it will not sell or transfer such Note (or interests therein) to a transferee acquiring such Note (or interests therein) unless the transferee makes the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements described in clause (i) hereof.
Each purchaser and each transferee of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Rule 144A Global Certificate or any interest therein will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (1) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein will not be and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person unless such purchaser or transferee receives the written consent of the Issuer (other than in the case of the Notes purchased by the Collateral Manager), provides an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex D (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular) to the Issuer as to its status as a Benefit Plan Investor or Controlling Person and unless the written consent of the Issuer to the contrary is obtained and, other than in the case of the Notes purchased by the Collateral Manager, holds such Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate, and (2)(a) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) if it is a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, (i) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note or an interest therein it will not be, subject to any Similar Law, and (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law.
A purchaser or transferee or other holder of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note in the form of a Definitive Certificate or any interest therein will be required to (i) represent and warrant in writing to the Issuer in an ERISA certificate (substantially in the form of Annex D (Form of ERISA Certificate) to this Offering Circular) (1) whether or not, for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein, it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person, (2) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (3) if such purchaser or transferee is a governmental, church, non-U.S. plan or other plan, (x) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein, will not be, subject to any Similar Law and (y) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law, and
(ii) agree to certain transfer restrictions regarding its interest in such Note.
No proposed transfer of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein) will be permitted or recognised if a transfer to a transferee will cause 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by Class) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors, disregarding Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or interests therein) held by Controlling Persons.
If the purchaser or transferee of any Notes or beneficial interest therein is a Benefit Plan Investor, it will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any of their affiliates, has provided any investment advice within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA to the Benefit Plan Investor, or to any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Fiduciary”), in connection with its acquisition of Notes, and (ii) the Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.
Any Plan fiduciary considering whether to acquire a Note on behalf of a Plan or an employee benefit plan whether or not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code should consult with its counsel regarding the potential consequences of such investment, the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and/or provisions of Other Plan Law or Similar Law, and the scope of any available exemption relating to such investment.
The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person, that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by
such plans in general or any particular plan, or that this investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
The following description consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Subscription Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement. Capitalised terms used in this section and not otherwise defined therein or in this Offering Circular shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the terms and conditions of the Notes.

Barclays Bank PLC or an affiliate thereof (in its capacity as initial purchaser, the “Initial Purchaser”) has agreed with the Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to subscribe and pay for each Class of the Refinancing Notes pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, at the following issue prices:
(a) Class X Notes, 100.00 per cent.;
(b) Class A Notes, 100.00 per cent.;
(c) Class B Notes, 100.00 per cent.;
(d) Class C Notes, 100.00 per cent.;
(e) Class D Notes, 100.00 per cent.;
(f) Class E Notes, 97.00 per cent.; and
(g) Class F Notes, 93.00 per cent.
in each case less subscription and underwriting fees to be agreed between the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser.
The Subscription Agreement entitles the Initial Purchaser to terminate it in certain circumstances prior to payment being made to the Issuer. Each of the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser may offer the Notes at prices as may be privately negotiated at the time of sale, which may vary among different purchasers and may be different from the issue price of the Notes.
It is a condition of the issue of the Refinancing Notes of each Class that the Refinancing Notes of each other Class be issued in the following principal amounts: Class X Notes: €1,500,000, Class A Notes: €279,000,000, Class B Notes: €45,700,000, Class C Notes: €27,000,000, Class D Notes: €30,800,000, Class E Notes: €24,750,000 and Class F Notes: €13,500,000 and that the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Subordinated Notes is at least
€47,800,000.
The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee and certain other participants against certain liabilities or to contribute to payments they may be required to make in respect thereof.
Certain of the Collateral Obligations may have been originally underwritten or placed by the Initial Purchaser. In addition, the Initial Purchaser may have in the past performed and may in the future perform investment banking services or other services for issuers of the Collateral Obligations. In addition, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates may from time to time as a principal or through one or more investment funds that it or they manage, make investments in the equity securities of one or more of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations, with a result that one or more of such issuers may be or may become controlled by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates.
No action has been or will be taken by the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Refinancing Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material in relation to the Refinancing Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material relating to the Refinancing Notes, may be made in or from any jurisdiction, except in circumstances which will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser.
United States
The Refinancing Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S) or to U.S. Residents except in certain transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and in the manner so as not to require the registration of the Issuer as an “investment company” pursuant to the Investment Company Act.
The Issuer has been advised that the Initial Purchaser proposes to offer the Refinancing Notes (a) outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and in accordance with applicable law and (b) in the United States (directly or through its U.S. broker dealer Affiliate) in reliance on Rule 144A only to or for the accounts of QIBs, each of which purchasers or accountholders is also a QP.
The Refinancing Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000, each and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Refinancing Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A will be issued in minimum denominations of €250,000, each and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any offer or sale of Rule 144A Notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. After the Notes are released for sale, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchaser.
The Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver any Regulation S Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S) or U.S. Resident as part of their distribution at any time and that it will send to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration to which it sells Regulation S Notes a confirmation or other notice setting forth the prohibition on offers and sales of the Regulation S Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person or U.S. Resident.
This Offering Circular has been prepared by the Issuer for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Refinancing Notes and for the listing of the Refinancing Notes of each Class on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin. The Issuer and the Initial Purchaser reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase, in whole or in part, for any reason, or to sell less than the principal amount of Refinancing Notes which may be offered. This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to any person in the United States or to any U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S). Distribution of this Offering Circular to any such U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S) or to any person within the United States, other than in accordance with the procedures described above, is unauthorised and any disclosure of any of its contents, without the prior written consent of the Issuer, is prohibited.
Other Selling Restrictions

(1) provide any information and documentation concerning its investment in its Notes to The Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and any other relevant tax authority and (2) take such other steps as they deem necessary or helpful to ensure that the Issuer complies with FATCA and CRS.

(c) it has provided an IRS Form W-8ECI representing that all payments received or to be received by it from the Issuer are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and includible in its gross income; and

14.

15. No purchase or transfer of a Class E Note, Class F Note or Subordinated Note will be recorded or otherwise recognised unless the purchaser or transferee has provided the Issuer with a certificate substantially in the form of Annex D (Form of ERISA Certificate) hereto.
16.

ANNEX A MOODY’S RECOVERY RATES
The “Moody’s Recovery Rate” is, with respect to any Collateral Obligation, as of any date of determination, the recovery rate determined in accordance with the following, in the following order of priority:
(a) if the Collateral Obligation has been specifically assigned a recovery rate by Moody’s (for example, in connection with the assignment by Moody’s of an estimated rating), such recovery rate; or
(b) if the preceding clause does not apply to the Collateral Obligation, except with respect to Corporate Rescue Loans, the rate determined pursuant to the table below based on the number of rating subcategories difference between the Collateral Obligation’s Moody’s Rating and its Moody’s Default Probability Rating (for purposes of clarification, if the Moody’s Rating is higher than the Moody’s Default Probability Rating, the rating subcategories difference will be positive and if it is lower, negative):

or,
(c) if the Collateral Obligation is a Corporate Rescue Loan (other than a Corporate Rescue Loan which has been specifically assigned a recovery rate by Moody’s), 50 per cent.
* If such Collateral Obligation does not have both a CFR and an Assigned Moody’s Rating, such Collateral Obligation will be deemed to be an Unsecured Bond, Unsecured Senior Loan or High Yield Bond for the purposes of this table.
“Moody’s Senior Secured Loan” means:
(a) a loan that:
(i) is not (and cannot by its terms become) subordinate in right of payment to any other debt obligation of the obligor of the loan; other than borrowed money, trade claims, capitalised leases or other similar obligations, or no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or stock, provided that a revolving loan of the Obligor that, pursuant to its terms, may require one or more advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or stock in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loan representing up to 15 per cent. of the Obligor’s senior debt (or more if Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s has been obtained);
(ii) (x) is secured by a valid first priority perfected security interest or lien in, to or on specified collateral securing the obligor’s obligations under the loan and (y) such specified collateral does not consist entirely of equity securities or common stock; provided that any loan that would be considered a Moody’s Senior Secured Loan but for clause (y) above shall be considered a Moody’s Senior Secured Loan if it is a loan made to a parent entity and as to which the Collateral Manager determines in good faith that the value of the common stock of the subsidiary (or other equity interests in the subsidiary) securing such loan at or about the time of acquisition of such loan by the Issuer has a value that is at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of such loan and the outstanding principal balances of any other obligations of such parent entity that are pari passu with such loan, which value may include, among other things, the enterprise value of such subsidiary of such parent entity; and
(iii) the value of the collateral securing the loan together with other attributes of the obligor (including, without limitation, its general financial condition, ability to generate cash flow available for debt service and other demands for that cash flow) is adequate (in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Collateral Manager) to repay the loan in accordance with its terms and to repay all other loans of equal seniority secured by a first lien or security interest in the same collateral); and
(b) the loan is not:
(i) a Corporate Rescue Loan; or
(ii) a loan for which the security interest or lien (or the validity or effectiveness thereof) in substantially all of its collateral attaches, becomes effective, or otherwise “springs” into existence after the origination thereof.
“Senior Secured Bond” means any obligation that (a) constitutes borrowed money, (b) is in the form of, or represented by, a bond, note (other than any note evidencing a loan), certificated debt security or other debt security, (c) is expressly stated to bear interest based upon a fixed rate, (d) does not constitute and is not secured by, Margin Stock, (e) if it is subordinated by its terms, is subordinated only to indebtedness for borrowed money, trade claims, capitalised leases or other similar obligations, or no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or stock, provided that a revolving loan of the Obligor that, pursuant to its terms, may require one or more advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or stock in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loan representing up to 15 per cent. of the Obligor’s senior debt (or more if Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s has been obtained) and (f) is secured by a valid first priority perfected security interest or lien in, to or on specified collateral securing the obligor’s obligations under such obligation.
“Unsecured Bond” means any of a senior unsecured obligation that (a) constitutes borrowed money, (b) is in the form of, or represented by, a bond, note, certificated debt security or other debt security (other than any of the foregoing that evidences an Unsecured Senior Loan) and (c) which is not (and by its terms is not permitted to become) subordinate in right of payment to any other debt for borrowed money incurred by the obligor under such obligation except for borrowed money, trade claims, capitalised leases or other similar obligations, or no other obligation of the Obligor has any higher priority security interest in such assets or stock, provided that a revolving loan of the Obligor that, pursuant to its terms, may require one or more future advances to be made to the borrower may have a higher priority security interest in such assets or stock in the event of an enforcement in respect of such loan representing up to 15 per cent. of the Obligor’s senior debt (or more if Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s has been obtained).
ANNEX B
S&P RECOVERY RATES
(a) (i) If a Collateral Obligation has an S&P Recovery Rating, or is pari passu with another obligation of the same Obligor that has an S&P Recovery Rating and is secured by the same collateral as such other obligation, the S&P Recovery Rate for such Collateral Obligation shall be determined as follows:

ANNEX D
FORM OF ERISA CERTIFICATE
The purpose of this ERISA Certificate (this “Certificate”) is, among other things, to (i) endeavour to ensure that less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) issued by Ares European CLO VIII B.V. (the “Issuer”) is held by (a) an employee benefit plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (b) a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or (c) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity (collectively, “Benefit Plan Investors”),
(ii) obtain from you certain representations and agreements and (iii) provide you with certain related information with respect to your acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes. By signing this Certificate, you agree to be bound by its terms.
Please be aware that the information contained in this Certificate is not intended to constitute advice and the examples given below are not intended to be, and are not, comprehensive. You should contact your own counsel if you have any questions in completing this Certificate. Capitalised terms not defined in this Certificate shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Trust Deed.
If a box is not checked, you are representing, warranting and agreeing that the applicable Section does not, and will not, apply to you.
1. ☐ Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA or the Code. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code.
Examples: (i) tax qualified retirement plans such as pension, profit sharing and section 401(k) plans, (ii) welfare benefit plans such as accident, life and medical plans, (iii) individual retirement accounts or “IRAs” and “Keogh” plans and (iv) certain tax-qualified educational and savings trusts.
2. ☐ Entity Holding Plan Assets. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an entity or fund whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in such entity.
Examples: (i) an insurance company separate account, (ii) a bank collective trust fund and (iii) a hedge fund or other private investment vehicle where 25 per cent. or more of the total value of any class of its equity is held by Benefit Plan Investors.
If you check Box 2, please indicate the maximum percentage of the entity or fund that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code: per cent.
AN ENTITY OR FUND THAT CANNOT PROVIDE THE FOREGOING PERCENTAGE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS OWN LESS THAN 25 PER CENT. OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE CLASS E NOTES, THE CLASS F NOTES AND THE SUBORDINATED NOTES, 100 PER CENT. OF THE ASSETS OF THE ENTITY OR FUND WILL BE TREATED AS “PLAN ASSETS.”
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are technical. Accordingly, if you have any questions regarding whether you may be an entity described in this Section 2, you should consult with your counsel.
3. ☐ Insurance Company General Account. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are an insurance company purchasing the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes with funds from our or their general account (i.e., the insurance company’s corporate investment portfolio), whose assets, in whole or in part, constitute “plan assets” for purposes of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”).
If you check Box 3, please indicate the maximum percentage of the insurance company general account that will constitute “plan assets” for purposes of conducting the 25 per cent. test under the Plan Asset Regulations: per cent. IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERCENTAGE IN THE BLANK SPACE, YOU WILL BE COUNTED AS IF YOU FILLED IN 100 PER CENT. IN THE BLANK SPACE.
4. ☐ None of Sections (1) Through (3) Above Apply. We, or the entity on whose behalf we are acting, are a person that does not fall into any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above. If, after the date hereof, any of the categories described in Sections (1) through (3) above would apply, we will promptly notify the Issuer of such change.
5. No Prohibited Transaction. If we checked any of the boxes in Sections (1) through (3) above, we represent, warrant and agree that our acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
6. Not Subject to Similar Law and No Violation of Other Plan Law. If we are a governmental, church, non-
U.S. or other plan, we represent, warrant and agree that (a) we are not subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other law or regulation that could cause the underlying assets of the Issuer to be treated as assets of the investor in any Note (or interest therein) by virtue of its interest and thereby subject the Issuer or the Collateral Manager (or other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Issuer’s assets) to laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and (b) our acquisition, holding and disposition of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes do not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any law or regulation that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
7. ☐ Controlling Person. We are, or we are acting on behalf of any of: (i) the Collateral Manager, (ii) any person that has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the Issuer, (iii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets or (iv) any “affiliate” of any of the above persons. “Affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan Asset Regulations. Any of the persons described in the first sentence of this Section 7 is referred to in this Certificate as a “Controlling Person.”
Note: We understand that, for purposes of determining whether Benefit Plan Investors hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class), the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes held by Controlling Persons (other than Benefit Plan Investors) are required to be disregarded.
8. Compelled Disposition. We acknowledge and agree that:
(a) if any representation that we made hereunder is subsequently shown to be false or misleading or our beneficial ownership otherwise causes a violation of the 25 per cent. Limitation, the Issuer may, promptly after such discovery, send notice to us demanding that we transfer our interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder within 10 days after the date of such notice;
(b) if we fail to transfer our Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes, the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to us, to sell our Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes or our interest in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder on such terms as the Issuer may choose;
(c) the Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes and selling such securities to the highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion;
(d) by our acceptance of an interest in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes, we agree to cooperate with the Issuer to effect such transfers;
(e) the proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale, shall be remitted to us; and
(f) the terms and conditions of any sale under this sub-section shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to us as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such discretion.
9. Required Notification and Agreement. We hereby agree that we (a) will inform the Issuer of any proposed transfer by us of all or a specified portion of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes and (b) will not initiate any such transfer after we have been informed by the Issuer in writing that such transfer would cause the 25 per cent. Limitation to be exceeded. We hereby agree and acknowledge that after the Issuer effects any permitted transfer of Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes owned by us to a Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person or receives notice of any such permitted change of status, the Issuer shall include such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in future calculations of the 25 per cent. Limitation made pursuant hereto unless subsequently notified that such Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (or such portion), as applicable, would no longer be deemed to be held by Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons.
10. Continuing Representation; Reliance. We acknowledge and agree that the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Certificate shall be deemed made on each day from the date we make such representations, warranties and agreements through and including the date on which we dispose of our interests in the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes. We understand and agree that the information supplied in this Certificate will be used and relied upon by the Issuer to determine that Benefit Plan Investors own or hold less than 25 per cent. of the total value of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class) upon any subsequent transfer of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Trust Deed.
11. Further Acknowledgement and Agreement. We acknowledge and agree that (i) all of the representations, warranties, agreements and assurances contained in this Certificate are for the benefit of the Issuer, the Trustee, Barclays Bank PLC and the Collateral Manager as third party beneficiaries hereof, (ii) copies of this Certificate and any information contained herein may be provided to the Issuer, the Trustee, Barclays Bank PLC, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, Affiliates of any of the foregoing parties and to each of the foregoing parties’ respective counsel for purposes of making the determinations described above and (iii) any acquisition or transfer of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes by us that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate shall be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.
12. Future Transfer Requirements.
Transferee Letter and its Delivery. We acknowledge and agree that we may not transfer any of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes or the Subordinated Notes in the form of Definitive Certificates to any person unless the Issuer has received a certificate substantially in the form of this Certificate. Any attempt to transfer in violation of this section will be null and void from the beginning, and of no legal effect.

Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.
Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Refinancing Notes.
The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and

The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action.
The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment, including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market.
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Article 50”) provides that a Member State which decides to withdraw from the EU is required to notify the European Council of its intention to do so.
The UK government gave formal notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 on 29 March 2017, which triggered the commencement of a negotiation process between the UK and the EU in respect of the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
This would be achieved by the UK ceasing to be party to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by the parallel repeal of the European Communities Act 1972.
The UK will cease to be a member of the EU from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, if a withdrawal agreement has not been concluded, two years after the notification under Article 50 was served, unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period (in respect of which see below).
In response to a second UK request to extend the Article 50 Period, on 11 April 2019 the European Council adopted its decision to extend the Article 50 Period until 31 October 2019.
2) Act 2019 received Royal Assent and passed into law.
, the UK Government sent a request for a further extension to the Article 50 Period to the President of the EU Council.
Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure).
If the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK, or a Dutch exemption, is not in place, then
(b) the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder to the extent it was holding the retention solely as “sponsor” in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (even if the Collateral Manager were to remain subject to UK financial services regulation).
This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.
It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the framework of Directive 2009/138/EC in the European Union.
The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Refinancing Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.
A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) to amend the CRR (as defined in the Conditions) (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter.
The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019.
The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).
There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below.
Investors should be aware, and in some cases are required to be aware, of the retention, due diligence and transparency requirements in the EU (the “EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements”) set out in the Securitisation Regulation (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Refinancing Notes.
The EU Retention, Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements contain due diligence requirements that apply to certain types of “institutional investor” as defined in the Securitisation Regulation (“Institutional Investors”).
in the securitisation in accordance with the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investor; (ii)
the originator, sponsor or securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which see “Transparency Requirements” below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation; and (iv) where the originator or original lender is established in a non-EU country, credit granting criteria apply that are substantially similar to those in (iii).
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.
The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent.
However, if the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of MiFID II and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK is not in place, then, unless the Collateral Manager elects to take any Retention Cure Action in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents, it may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder.
The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).
The originator, sponsor and SSPE (i.e. the Issuer) of a securitisation are required to designate one of them (the “reporting entity”) to fulfil the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting requirements in Article 7
Under Article 7
(Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, certain Transaction Documents and any transaction summary required pursuant to Article 7(1)(c) are required to be made available before pricing.
Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation also includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU)
The transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation with respect to the Transparency Requirements provide that until the application of the Transparency RTS, for the purposes of the Loan Reports and the Investor Reports, the reporting entity shall make available the information referred to in Annexes I to VIII of Delegated Regulation
In light of the Joint Statement, the transaction described herein will initially seek to comply with subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(1) and make available the information referred to in Annex VIII of the CRA3 RTS through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports (see “Description of the Reports”).
If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.
(e) of Article 7(l) through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”).
Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the sponsor as well as to the Issuer.
On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued.
In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Noteholders).
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitisation exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitisation, including the establishment and utilisation of a due diligence system for evaluating securitised products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitisation transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitisation Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organisation of the securitised product,” retains at least 5% of the securitised exposures.
At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitisation Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii)
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Refinancing Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.
The JFSA Securitisation Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market, (ii)
It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitisation Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitisation Regulation.
 Certain discretions of the Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer are restricted where the exercise of the discretion would cause the retention holding described in “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” section of this Offering Circular to be (or to be likely to be) insufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.
2.5 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” such as investment firms, alternative investment funds (
Prospective investors should also be aware that on 4 May 2017, the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation amending EMIR as regards the clearing obligation, the suspension of the clearing obligation, the reporting requirements, the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a central counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories (the “EMIR Refit”).
EMIR REFIT brings into that definition all alternative investment funds (“AIFs”), that are either established in the EEA or whose investment manager is authorised/registered under Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”).
EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”).
See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010.
The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets.
Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S.
The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities.
While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed.
It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.
proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration.
On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals.
However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future.
If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.
As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Refinancing Notes.
CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available.
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a non-U.S. banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund,” subject to certain exemptions.
A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exclusions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations.
In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts.
The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016.
The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU.
The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds.
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):

In February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, other than Estonia, the “Participating Member States”).
CRA Regulation in Europe

Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013.
The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances.
The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.
On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included The Netherlands and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”).
The United Kingdom and The Netherlands signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument.
The Netherlands double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty).
Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti- Tax Avoidance Directive 2)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.
2.18 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2

As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU)
The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive must be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law.
Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals.
The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30% of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward.
There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking.
On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches between EU Member States and third countries, which the EU Council adopted on 29 May 2017 in Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 ("Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2").
Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny or (in some circumstances) delay deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in the case of hybrid mismatches (for example, in certain cases where a deduction occurs in one year and so-called dual inclusion income arises in a later year).
Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 needs to be implemented in the EU Member States' national laws and regulations by 31 December 2019 and will have to apply as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches, for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will have to apply as of 1 January 2022.
A legislative proposal implementing the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 was published on 29 June 2019.
The Netherlands intend to implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 per 1 January 2020, although some of the provisions (regarding reverse hybrids) will not be in effect until 1 January 2022.
Generally speaking, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will only be of relevance in case of payments between related parties; however, Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 will also impact structured arrangements whereby the tax benefit of a hybrid mismatch has been included in the pricing (i.e. based on an agreement between two non-related parties).
In situations where (i) the taxpayer could not have reasonably been aware of the hybrid mismatch and (ii) does not benefit from such mismatch, a hybrid mismatch that may occur between third parties should not be affected by the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 rules.
Considering that the Issuer’s main purpose is receiving and paying interest on a regular basis from and to unrelated parties, the implementation of Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 may be of limited relevance to the Issuer.
This is on the basis of article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT act based upon Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU member states shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” (as defined by the relevant EU member state).
the European Court of Justice has ruled that the VAT exemption for investment management services can be applied to: (i) funds which constitute undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities within the meaning of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive (Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (as amended from time to time) including any implementing and/or delegated regulations, technical standards and guidance related thereto, the “UCITS Directive”) and (ii) funds which, without being collective investment undertakings within the meaning of that directive, display features that are sufficiently comparable for them to be in competition with such undertakings in particular that they are subject to specific State supervision under national law (as opposed to under the UCITS Directive).
Following the ECJ Fiscale Eenheid X case, there is a risk that the Issuer may not qualify as a “special investment fund” under the VAT Directive and/or the Dutch value added tax act.
The Issuer has been advised that although case law from the ECJ and Dutch courts confirms that CLO SPVs can be considered sufficiently comparable to UCITS and therefore should qualify as a “special investment fund” within the meaning of Article 11(1)(i)(3) of the Dutch VAT Act and Article 135(1)(g) of the VAT Directive respectively, the Issuer cannot exclude that the Dutch tax authorities may seek to change their position in the future and Dutch value added tax may be imposed on the Collateral Management Fees.
On 18 September 2018, the Dutch government released its Budget 2019 containing the Tax Plan for 2019, including a proposal for a new Withholding Tax Act ("WTA") on dividend distributions.
Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Co-operation in the Field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU)
Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application

The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU)
In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties.
The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU)
The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement).
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings (recast), which came into force on 26 June 2017, the centre of main interests (“COMI”) shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.
In the decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ restated the presumption in Council Regulation (EC)
In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Refinancing Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or directors (as the case may be) to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action.
Furthermore, the Refinancing Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Refinancing Notes under the Securities Act.
The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes.
On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective.
The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015.
Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered to be assets of such Plans.
In addition, certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
See the section entitled “Certain ERISA Considerations” below.
U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP at the time it acquires an interest in a Rule 144A Note (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”), the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder demanding that such holder transfer its interest outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person or within the United States to a U.S. Person that is a QIB/QP within 30 days of the date of such notice.
See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.
See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.
Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest (if any).
In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules.
In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.
European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.
However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer.
In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made,

Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the specific domestic UK corporation tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager acting on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (the “Investment Manager Exemption”) is available in the context of this transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Investment Manager Exemption is not available in the context of this transaction, the Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax if the exemption in Article 7(1) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty applies.
This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of Article 5(6) of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty.
The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent.
The Collateral Manager, is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.

In addition, upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment).
Accordingly, there is a risk to Noteholders that the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may take (or fail to take) action with respect to the appointment of a successor that is adverse to such Noteholders and that, if the Controlling Class fails to act (by way of Ordinary Resolution), the Collateral Manager could delay its removal for a significant period of time and obstruct the appointment of a successor following a vote to effect its replacement by voting against any successor and refusing to petition a court when no replacement is found.
Each of the Barclays Parties will act in its own commercial interest in its various capacities without regard to whether its interests conflict with those of the Noteholders or any other party.
From time to time, the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Barclays Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Barclays Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to Participation Agreements and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement.
The Barclays Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Refinancing Notes.
The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (
within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.
If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i)

below, the summary does not describe The Netherlands tax consequences for holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest or deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001
Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together with his/her partner (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5 per cent.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as assets of those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities the underlying assets of which include the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code (collectively, “Parties in Interest”)) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exception or exemption is applicable to the transaction.
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to substantially similar rules under federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations, and may be subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code.
Under ERISA and regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor (29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, and applicable guidance (the “Plan Asset Regulation”)), if a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
A “Benefit Plan Investor” means (1) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title
(2) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, or (3) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity.
I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code.
The Plan Asset Regulation defines an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no substantial equity features.
However, the characteristics of the Class E Notes and, to a greater extent, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation are less certain.
or more of the total value of the Class E Notes, Class F Notes or Subordinated Notes (determined separately by class and in accordance with the Plan Asset Regulation and the Trust Deed).
Even assuming the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes are not treated as equity interests in the Issuer for purposes of ERISA, these classes and the other classes of Notes are subject to other restrictions and, it is possible that an investment in such Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor (or with the use of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor) could be treated as a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made.
Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”)
Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, whether or not the Notes are treated as equity interests in the Issuer, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of such parties has investment authority might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available.
Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c) of ERISA and a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under that Section of ERISA, 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.

and/or Section 4975 of the Code (“Other Plan Law”), and no part of the assets to be used by it to acquire or hold such Note or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit

its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or interests therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a non-exempt violation of any Other Plan Law, and (ii) it will not sell or transfer such Note (or interests therein) to a transferee acquiring such Note (or interests therein) unless the transferee makes the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements described in clause (i) hereof.

whether or not, for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein, it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor or is a Controlling Person, (2) if it is, or is acting on behalf of, a Benefit Plan Investor, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (3) if such purchaser or transferee is a governmental, church, non-U.S. plan or other plan, (x)
none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or any of their affiliates, has provided any investment advice within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA to the Benefit Plan Investor, or to any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Fiduciary”), in connection with its acquisition of Notes, and (ii)
Any Plan fiduciary considering whether to acquire a Note on behalf of a Plan or an employee benefit plan whether or not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code should consult with its counsel regarding the potential consequences of such investment, the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and/or provisions of Other Plan Law or Similar Law, and the scope of any available exemption relating to such investment.
The sale of Notes to a Plan or an employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is in no respect a representation or warranty by the Issuer, or any other person, that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or such other plans generally or any particular plan, that any prohibited transaction exemption would apply to the acquisition, holding, or disposition of this investment by

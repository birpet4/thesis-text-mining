    <p>Under Section 619 of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">U.S. Dodd-Frank Act</a> and the corresponding implementing rules (the “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a>”) relevant banking entities (as defined under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a>) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.</p>
<p>An “ownership interest” is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.</p>
<p> The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.</p>
<p> The Issuer may be deemed to be a “covered fund” under the <a><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a></a> and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. “banking entities” and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.</p>
<p> It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.</p>
<p> The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. The holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.</p>
<p> There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a>, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> is still evolving. The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a>’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Refinancing Notes. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> and is considering an investment in the Refinancing Notes should consider the potential impact of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally.</p>
<p> Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a>. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp">Volcker Rule</a> or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Refinancing Notes, now or at any time in the future. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives</p>

<p> Information as to placement within the United States</p>
   <p> The Refinancing Notes of each Class offered pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) (the “Rule 144A Notes”) will be sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) that are also “qualified purchasers” for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (“QPs”). Rule 144A Notes of each Class will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Rule 144A Global Certificate” and together, the “Rule 144A Global Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”), or, in the case of Rule 144A Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. The Refinancing Notes of each Class sold outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes”) will each be represented on issue by beneficial interests in one or more permanent global certificates of such Class (each, a “Regulation S Global Certificate” and together, the “Regulation S Global Certificates”), in each case in fully registered form, without interest coupons or principal receipts, which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with, and registered in the name of, a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Regulation S Definitive Certificates, the registered holder thereof. Neither U.S. Persons nor U.S. residents (as determined for the purposes of the Investment Company Act) (“U.S. Residents”) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate or a Regulation S Definitive Certificate. Ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Certificates and the Rule 144A Global Certificates (together, the “Global Certificates”) will be shown on, and transfers thereof will only be effected through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants. Notes in definitive certificated form will be issued only in limited circumstances. The Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Subordinated Notes may, in certain circumstances described herein, be issued in definitive, certificated, fully registered form, pursuant to the Trust Deed and will be offered outside the United States to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S and within the United States to persons who are QIB/QPs in reliance on Rule 144A and, in each case, will be registered in the name of the holder (or a nominee thereof). In each case, purchasers and transferees of notes will be deemed and in certain circumstances will be required to have made certain representations and agreements. See “Form of the Refinancing Notes”, “Book Entry Clearance Procedures”, “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.</p>
   <p>    The Issuer has not been registered under the Investment Company Act. Each purchaser of an interest in the Refinancing Notes (other than a non-U.S. Person outside the U.S.) will be deemed to have represented and agreed that it is a QIB and a QP and will also be deemed to have made the representations set out in “Transfer Restrictions” herein. The purchaser of any Refinancing Note, by such purchase, agrees that such Refinancing Note is being acquired for its own account and not with a view to distribution and may be resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (1) to the Issuer (upon redemption thereof or otherwise), (2) to a person the purchaser reasonably believes is a QIB/QP, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or (3) outside the United States to a non-U.S. Person in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S, in each case, in compliance with the Trust Deed and all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions”.</p>

    <p>     Commodity Pool Regulation</p>
        <p>      BASED UPON INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDED FROM A DIVISION OF THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”), THE ISSUER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY POOL AND AS SUCH, THE ISSUER (OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER ON THE ISSUER’S BEHALF) MAY ENTER INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF “SWAP” AS SET OUT IN THE CEA (AS DEFINED BELOW)) FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF LEGAL ADVICE FROM REPUTABLE COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS EITHER A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND CFTC REGULATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER.

UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO/CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.</p>

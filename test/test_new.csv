If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, then the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of the two Diversity Scores in the Diversity Score Table.;1;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Collateral Obligations are not currently in compliance with the Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon then applicable and would not be in compliance with any other Recovery Rate Case or S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable, the Collateral Manager may select a different Recovery Rate Case or a different S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon (or both), as applicable, that is not further out of compliance than the current Recovery Rate Case and the S&P Test Matrix Spread and Coupon, as applicable.;1;
If the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not satisfied as of any Determination Date on and after the Effective Date and during the Reinvestment Period, on the related Payment Date, Interest Proceeds shall be paid to the Principal Account to be applied for the purpose of the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) 50 per cent. of all remaining Interest Proceeds available for payment pursuant to paragraph (V) of the Interest Priority of Payments and (2) the amount which, after giving effect to payment of all amounts payable in respect of paragraphs (A) through (U) (inclusive) of the Interest Priority of Payments, would be sufficient to cause the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test to be satisfied as of such Payment Date after giving effect to any payments made pursuant to paragraph (V) of the Interest Priority of Payments.;1;
If amounts distributable on any Payment Date in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are insufficient to pay the Senior Management Fee or the Subordinated Management Fee in full, then a portion of the Senior Management Fee or Subordinated Management Fee, as applicable, equal to the shortfall will be deferred and will be payable on subsequent Payment Dates on which funds are available therefor according to the Priorities of Payment.

The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).;1;
If a successor Collateral Manager is appointed as described in “Appointment of Successor” in the section “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” and the outgoing Collateral Manager does not sell the Retention Notes, such outgoing Collateral Manager shall continue to be bound by the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in respect of the Retention Notes and such provisions shall not apply to such successor.;1;
The Issuer has accurately reproduced the information contained in the section entitled “EU Retention and Transparency Requirements – Origination of Collateral Obligations” from information provided to it by the Collateral Manager but it has not independently verified such information.;0;
The Collateral Manager may also cause the Issuer to acquire certain assets for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of “originator” under the Securitisation Regulation which are intended to form part of the Collateral Obligations (“Limb (b) Originator Assets”), pursuant to a conditional sale agreement (“Conditional Sale Agreement”) between the Collateral Manager (as purchaser) and the Issuer (as seller) under which the Issuer shall, in the event any such Limb (b) Originator Asset becomes a Defaulted Obligation within 15 Business Days of the date upon which the Collateral Manager entered into a binding commitment to purchase such Collateral Obligation from the Issuer pursuant to such Conditional Sale Agreement, have the right to require the Collateral Manager to complete the purchase from it of the relevant Limb (b) Originator Asset for the same purchase price as the Issuer committed to purchase and settle such Limb (b) Originator Asset.;0;
In the event that the Collateral Manager holds the Retention Notes in its capacity as “originator” as described above, it will not select assets to be transferred to the Issuer for the purposes of meeting the Originator Requirement detailed above with the aim of rendering losses on the assets transferred to the Issuer higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on its balance sheet;0;
Credit Granting Criteria;0;
As of the Issue Date, the Issuer has entered into Currency Hedge Transactions in respect of a portion of the Portfolio.;0;
Subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) may enter into transactions documented under a 1992 (Multicurrency - Cross Border) Master Agreement, 2002 Master Agreement or such other form published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). Each Hedge Transaction will be evidenced by a confirmation entered into pursuant to a Hedge Agreement.;0;
For the avoidance of doubt, the ability of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf to enter into any Currency Hedge Transactions, and therefore the ability of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf to acquire Non-Euro Obligations, is subject to the satisfaction of the Hedging Condition.;0;
All amounts received by the Issuer in respect of Non-Euro Obligations shall be paid into the appropriate Currency Account and all amounts payable by the Issuer under any Currency Hedge Transaction (other than any initial exchange amounts payable in Euros by the Issuer, any Hedge Replacement Payments and any Currency Hedge Issuer Termination Payments save to the extent otherwise provided in Condition 3(j)(viii) (Currency Accounts)), will be paid out of the appropriate Currency Account, in each case to the extent amounts are available therein.;0;
Notwithstanding the above, upon the insolvency of the Issuer and/or the acceleration of the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration), the Currency Hedge Counterparty may, but shall not be obliged to, terminate any or all Currency Hedge Transactions in which case any Currency Hedge Issuer Termination Payment would be paid (following acceleration of the Notes) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) and the Post- Acceleration Priority of Payments.;0;
The obligations of the Issuer under each Hedge Agreement will be limited to the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral as applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out in Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment) provided that any Counterparty Downgrade Collateral standing to the credit of a Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Account shall be applied and delivered by the Issuer (or by the Collateral Manager on its behalf) in accordance with Condition 3(j)(iv) (Counterparty Downgrade Collateral Accounts). The Issuer will have the benefit of non-petition language similar to the language set out in Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non- Petition).;0;
A Hedge Counterparty may transfer its rights and obligations under a Hedge Agreement to any institution which (or whose credit support provider (as defined in the applicable Hedge Agreement)) satisfies the applicable Rating Requirement and provided that such institution has the Dutch regulatory capacity to enter into derivatives transactions with Dutch residents.;0;
Any of the requirements set out herein may be modified in order to meet any new or additional requirements of any Rating Agency then rating any Class of Notes.;0;
(a) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments representing Principal Proceeds;0;
(b) the purchase price, principal amount, redemption price, annual interest rate, maturity date and Obligor under each Eligible Investment purchased from funds in the Accounts.;0;
Payment Date Report;0;
Purchasers of Notes may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price of each Note.;0;
POTENTIAL PURCHASERS WHO ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THEIR TAX POSITION ON PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER OR EXERCISE OF ANY NOTE SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS. IN PARTICULAR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES WOULD BE CHARACTERISED BY ANY RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY.;0;
Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors concerning the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding and/or selling Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes under the applicable laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.;0;

3. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations General;0;
At this time it is not possible to state with certainty if and when any withdrawal agreement will be entered into, what might be the final terms and effective date of such a withdrawal agreement or the date on which any transition period will end if such an agreement is entered into.;1;
This approach entails that the Competent Authorities can, when examining reporting entities’ compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Securitisation Regulation, take into account the type and extent of information already being disclosed by reporting entities.;1;
Notably, the FC definition will effectively capture non-EU AIFs managed by non-EU managers when they are a counterparty to an EU FC. Previously, such funds were usually determined to be third country entities (“TCEs”) that would be non-financial counterparties (“NFCs”) if they were established in the EU, meaning that such funds would be out of scope of the clearing obligation and risk mitigation obligations (subject to the fund not exceeding the relevant clearing threshold for NFCs) when dealing with EU FCs.;1;
These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA.;1;
New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Refinancing Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. ;1;
Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Refinancing Notes.;1;
As the Issuer has its registered office in The Netherlands has Dutch directors and is registered for tax in The Netherlands, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. ;1;
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion.;1;
This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress.;1;
Aggregate Principal Balance” means the aggregate of the Principal Balances of all the Collateral Obligations and, when used with respect to some portion of the Collateral Obligations, means the aggregate of the Principal Balances of such portion of the Collateral Obligations, in each case, as at the date of determination.;1;
“Credit Risk Obligation” means any Collateral Obligation that, in the Collateral Manager’s reasonable commercial judgment (which judgment will not be called into question as a result of subsequent events), has a risk of declining in credit quality or price or where the relevant underlying Obligor has failed to meet its other financial obligations;1;
Where the payment of any amount in accordance with the Priorities of Payment set out above is subject to any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax or any other tax is payable by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of any such amount, payment of the amount so deducted or withheld or of the tax so due shall be made to the relevant taxing authority pari passu with and, so far as possible, at the same time as the payment of the amount in respect of which the relevant deduction or withholding or other liability to tax has arisen.;1;
In addition, any purchaser in any such sale which is a Noteholder may deliver Notes held by it in place of payment of the purchase price for such Collateral where the amount payable to such Noteholder in respect of such Notes pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, had the purchase price been paid in cash, is equal to or exceeds such purchase price.;1;

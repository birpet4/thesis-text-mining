In this Offering Circular, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Euro”, “euro”, “€” and “EUR” are to the lawful currency of the member states of the European Union that have adopted and retain the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended from time to time provided that if any member state or states ceases to have such single currency as its lawful currency (such member state(s) being the “Exiting State(s)”), the euro shall, for the avoidance of doubt, mean for all purposes the single currency adopted and retained as the lawful currency of the remaining member states and shall not include any successor currency introduced by the Exiting State(s) but for the avoidance of doubt shall not affect any definition of euro used in respect of the Collateral and any references to “US Dollar”, “US dollar”, “USD”, “U.S. Dollar” or “$” shall mean the lawful currency of the United States of America.;1;
For the avoidance of doubt, and following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements if the Collateral Administrator agrees to assist the Issuer and the Collateral Manager in providing reporting on behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator will not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. In making available such information and reporting, the Collateral Administrator will not assume responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for the use or onward disclosure of any such information or documentation), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.;1;
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, as may be reasonably required in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the Transparency Requirements of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation, the Issuer intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and (e) of Article 7(l) of the Securitisation Regulation through the Monthly Reports and the Payment Date Reports, see “Description of the Reports”) and (c) following the adoption of the final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) will propose in writing to the Collateral Administrator the form, content, method of distribution and timing of such reports and information. The Collateral Administrator shall consult with the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and, if it agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) to assist the Issuer in providing such reporting on such proposed terms, shall confirm in writing to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager and shall make such information (as provided to it by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available (or procure that such information is made available) via a website currently located at https://sf.citidirect.com (or such other website as may be notified in writing by the Collateral Administrator to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Collateral Manager and as further notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices)) which shall be accessible to any person who certifies (substantially in the form set out in the Collateral Management Agreement or such other form which may be agreed between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator from time to time) (which certificate may be given electronically and upon which certificate the Collateral Administrator shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) to the Collateral Administrator that it is a competent authority, a Noteholder or a potential investor in the Notes (and in such other manner as required by any competent authority (as instructed to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator)). If the Collateral Administrator does not agree on the terms of reporting or, in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer (acting on the advice of the Collateral Manager), the Collateral Administrator is or will be unable or unwilling to provide such reporting, the Issuer (with the consent of the Collateral Manager) shall be entitled to appoint another entity to make the relevant information available for the purposes of Article 7 (Transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs) of the Securitisation Regulation.;1;
The Issuer may be deemed to be a “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. “banking entities” and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.;1;
BASED UPON INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDED FROM A DIVISION OF THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”), THE ISSUER IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY POOL AND AS SUCH, THE ISSUER (OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER ON THE ISSUER’S BEHALF) MAY ENTER INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF “SWAP” AS SET OUT IN THE CEA (AS DEFINED BELOW)) FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF LEGAL ADVICE FROM REPUTABLE COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS EITHER A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND CFTC REGULATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER. IN THE EVENT THAT TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL”, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EITHER SEEK TO UTILIZE ANY AVAILABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) OR REGISTER AS A CPO. UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO/CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.;1;
Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirements for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial distress of another financial institution may result in the;1;
Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future EU-UK relationship, EU laws (other than those EU laws transposed into English law (see below)) will cease to apply within the UK pursuant to the terms and timing of a future withdrawal agreement. This would be achieved by the UK ceasing to be party to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by the parallel repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. The UK will cease to be a member of the EU from the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, if a withdrawal agreement has not been concluded, two years after the notification under Article 50 was served, unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend this period (in respect of which see below).;1;
If the UK were, as a consequence of leaving the EU, no longer within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and a passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK, or a Dutch exemption, is not in place, then (a) a UK manager such as the Collateral Manager may be unable to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer in reliance upon the passporting of relevant regulated services within the EU on a cross-border basis provided for under MiFID II and (b) the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder to the extent it was holding the retention solely as “sponsor” in accordance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (even if the Collateral Manager were to remain subject to UK financial services regulation). See “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements –Transparency Requirements” below.;1;
(ii) receipt of legal advice from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, DLA Piper UK LLP or other reputable legal counsel as selected in the Collateral Manager’s sole discretion that such Retention Cure Action is consistent with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements. The Collateral Manager does not have any obligation to consider or take any Retention Cure Action and, if the Collateral Manager determines not to take any Retention Cure Action, it may no longer be eligible to act as the Retention Holder pursuant to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (and for the avoidance of doubt, even if a Retention Cure Action is taken, it is not certain whether such action would result in compliance with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements).;1;
If a Competent Authority determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the Transparency Requirements, then: (i) investors may be required by their regulator to set aside additional capital against their investment in the Refinancing Notes or take other remedial measures in respect of their investment in the Refinancing Notes and (ii) the Collateral Manager as the originator and/or the Issuer may be subject to the Pecuniary Sanctions as described above. Any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the Refinancing Notes and any such Pecuniary Sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager as the originator may materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes in the secondary market.;1;
If any determination is made that this transaction is subject to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.;1;
EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. The Collateral Manager would not be permitted to be authorised under both AIFMD and under MiFID II. It would therefore not be able to apply for authorisation under AIFMD unless it ceases to maintain its current MiFID II (in which case it may not be able to hold the retention as a “sponsor” as required under the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements (see “Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements - Transparency Requirements” above)). If considered to be an AIF managed by an AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with clearing obligations and/or other risk mitigation techniques (including obligations to post margin to any central clearing counterparty or market counterparty) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the EMIR Refit, all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.;1;
If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.;1;
In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5 per cent. of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100 per cent. of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs;1;
Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially grer than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition, it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.;1;
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New regulations have been proposed but have not yet been fully implemented in all respects. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Refinancing Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Refinancing Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Refinancing Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.;1;
In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.;1;
Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application;1;
Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Furthermore, where one or more Classes of Rated Notes are redeemed through a Refinancing, Noteholders should be aware that any such redemption would occur outside of the Note Payment Sequence and the Priorities of Payment. In addition Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.;1;
Non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non- payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission). Failure on the part of the Issuer to pay Interest Amounts due and payable on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes pursuant to Condition 6 (Interest) and the Priorities of Payment will not constitute a Note Event of Default unless following a Frequency Switch Event only: following redemption in full of the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class C Notes when the same becomes due and payable following redemption if full of the Class C Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class D Notes when the same becomes due and payable, following redemption if full of the Class D Notes, failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class E Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and following redemption if full of the Class E Notes failure to pay any interest in respect of the Class F Notes when the same becomes due and payable, (in each case where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or seven Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission).;1;
Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class X Noteholders and the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.;0;
Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.;0;
Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority to the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments or (B) otherwise, in the case of a Note Event of Default specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv) or (vi) of Condition 10 (Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution (and no other Class of Notes) may direct the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to, contemporaneously or subsequent to such Note Event of Default.;0;
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.;0;
To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.;0;
There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations and Caa Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value/Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.;0;
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.;0;
In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.;0;
The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Refinancing Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to (i) redeem the Refinanced Notes at their respective aggregate Redemption Prices, (ii) pay certain Administrative Expenses (including Refinancing Costs) and/or Trustee Fees and Expenses (including Refinancing Costs), as applicable, in accordance with the Conditions, (iii) pay certain other amounts in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and (iv) to be transferred to the Principal Account to be applied, among other things, toward the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations (including the) Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations). The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.;0;
Neither the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited nor any of their Affiliates have any affirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before offering any investments to other funds, accounts or portfolios (including, without limitation, any collateralised loan obligation transaction) that the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited or any of their Affiliates manage or advise. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also make investments on their own behalf without effecting such investment opportunities on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may be bound by affirmative obligations at present or in the future, whereby it or they are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager Ares Management Limited or their Affiliates effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Alternatively, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise simultaneously with or in addition to effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Thus, other funds, accounts or portfolios that it or they manage or advise could become co-investors with the Issuer.;0;
Claims in respect of principal and interest payable on redemption in full of the relevant Notes while the Notes are represented by a Definitive Certificate will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required by Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) within a period of five years, in the case of interest, and ten years, in the case of principal, from the date on which payment in respect of such Notes is received by the Principal Paying Agent.;0;
Any meeting of the Noteholders shall (in each case, subject to anything else specified in the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the relevant Transaction Document, as applicable) have power by Ordinary Resolution to approve any other matter relating to the Notes not referred to in paragraph (vii) (Extraordinary Resolution) above.;0;
The Trustee may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Trust Deed, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation, agree to a change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes without the consent of the Noteholders of any Class, provided the Issuer does all such things as the Trustee may require in order that such change in the place of residence of the Issuer for taxation purposes is fully effective and complies with such other requirements which are in the interests of the Noteholders as it may direct.;0;
In the event a Global Certificate is to be exchanged, the relevant Global Certificate shall be exchanged in full for Definitive Certificates and the Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any Transfer Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion, authentication and dispatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person having an interest in a Global Certificate must provide the Registrar with (a) a written order containing instructions and such other information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete, execute and deliver such Definitive Certificates and (b) in the case of the Rule 144A Global Certificate only, a fully completed, signed certification substantially to the effect that the exchanging holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or, in the case of simultaneous sale pursuant to Rule 144A, a certification that the transfer is being made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A. Definitive Certificates issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall bear the legends applicable to transfers pursuant to Rule 144A, as set out under “Transfer Restrictions”.;0;
No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Refinancing Notes held within such Clearing System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Refinancing Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the Clearing Systems to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.;0;
Secondary market sales of book entry interests in the Refinancing Notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg to purchasers of book entry interests in the Refinancing Notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will be conducted in accordance with the normal rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds.;0;
S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand.;0;
Other than the issuance of the Original Notes, the Issuer has not previously carried on any business or activities other than those incidental to its incorporation, the acquisition of the Portfolio (including pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement), the authorisation and issue of the Refinancing Notes and activities incidental to the exercise of its rights and compliance with its obligations under the Transaction Documents (including making payments on the Original Notes as required thereunder). On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue the Refinancing Notes and enter into certain documents and agreements entered into in connection with such issuance.;0;
Mrs Harper is Team Leader Accounting at TMF Capital Markets Services in The Netherlands. Before joining TMF Group in 2010, Ms. Harper worked as a Subsidiary Accountant at a South African insurance company in Johannesburg (Renasa Insurance Company). Prior to this position Mrs. Harper worked as an Accountant in a telecommunications company in Johannesburg (MWeb Business) and prior to that worked as an Auditor for one of the big 4 audit firms (Deloitte). Mrs. Harper holds a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Accounting from the University of Johannesburg.;0;
So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer will be subject to the restrictions set out in the Conditions and in the Trust Deed. In particular, the Issuer has undertaken not to carry out any business other than the issue of the Notes and acquiring, holding and disposing of the Portfolio in accordance with the Conditions and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, entering into the Trust Deed, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Issuer Management Agreement, any Collateral Acquisition Agreements, the Subscription Agreement, the Forward Purchase Agreement and any Hedge Agreements and exercising the rights and performing the obligations under each such agreement and all other transaction documents incidental thereto. The Issuer will not have any substantial liabilities other than in connection with the Notes and any secured obligations. The Issuer will not have any subsidiaries and, save in respect of the fees and expenses generated in connection with the issue of the Notes (referred to below), any related profits and the proceeds of any deposits and investments made from such fees or from amounts representing the proceeds of the Issuer’s issued share capital, the Issuer will not accumulate any surpluses.;0;

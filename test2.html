<tr><td> It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.

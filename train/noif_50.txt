The Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests will be used as criteria for purchasing Collateral Debt Obligations. The Collateral Administrator will measure the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Collateral Quality Tests on each Measurement Date (save as otherwise provided herein).
Solely for the purposes of determining satisfaction of the Reinvestment Criteria (both during and following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period), the concentration limits for the Fitch Maximum Obligor Concentration Test and Fixed Rate Collateral Debt Obligations applicable to the case set out in a Fitch Tests Matrix (or a linear interpolation between any Fitch Tests Matrices in the case of a linear interpolation) selected by the Investment Manager in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs, shall be deemed to be a “Collateral Quality Test” for so long as such case remains selected by the Investment Manager.
The following is a summary of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. The summary relates only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain other classes of persons such as dealers in securities.
The summary is based upon Irish tax laws and the practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular, which are subject to prospective or retroactive change. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own advisors as to the Irish or other tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Notes including, in particular, the effect of any state or local tax laws.
Relief from Irish income tax may also be available under other exemptions contained in Irish tax legislation or under the specific provisions of a double tax treaty between Ireland and the country of residence of the holder of the Notes.
A Noteholder will not be subject to Irish taxes on capital gains provided that such Noteholder is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and such Noteholder does not have an enterprise, or an interest in an enterprise, which carries on business in Ireland through a branch or agency or a permanent representative to which or to whom the Notes are attributable.
For as long as the Issuer is a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110, no Irish stamp duty will be payable on either the issue or transfer of the Notes, provided that the money raised by the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer’s business.
An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of more than 182 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year).
This summary is based on interpretations of the Code, regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This summary addresses only holders that purchase Notes for cash at initial issuance (and, in the case of the Rated Notes, at their issue price (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of Rated Notes within the applicable Class was sold to investors)) and beneficially own such Notes as capital assets and not as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “synthetic security” or a “conversion transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment. This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as alternative minimum tax consequences) that may be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts, or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in securities electing mark-to-market treatment; mutual funds or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the United States; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the Notes in tax- deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; or “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes). This summary also does not address the tax consequences to shareholders, or other equity holders in, or beneficiaries of, a holder of Notes, or any state, local or foreign tax
Recent legislation may require a beneficial owner of a Note that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. Although the precise application of this rule is unclear, it might require the accrual of income earlier than is the case under the general tax rules described below. Prospective investors in Notes that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of this legislation to their particular situations.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SUBJECT.
U.S. Investment Restrictions will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Milbank LLP will not cover such deviations from the U.S. Investment Restrictions. The opinion of Milbank LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that causes or allows the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Milbank LLP does not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.
The Issuer may hold certain assets in one or more Issuer Subsidiaries, which will be treated as either U.S. or foreign corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any foreign Issuer Subsidiary may be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and subject to U.S. federal income tax (and possibly a 30 per cent. branch profits tax) on a net income basis at regular corporate tax rates, may file U.S. tax returns and reports (or protective U.S. tax returns and reports), and/or may be subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax on some or all of its income. Any U.S. Issuer Subsidiary would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular corporate tax rates, and would be required to file U.S. tax returns and reports. In addition, distributions from a U.S. Issuer Subsidiary to the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax. U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes will not be permitted to use losses recognised by an Issuer Subsidiary to offset gains recognised by the Issuer, and U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes may be subject to adverse PFIC or CFC rules with respect to the Issuer Subsidiary, as described above. The existence of both a U.S. Issuer Subsidiary and a foreign Issuer Subsidiary may, in and of itself, cause the foreign Issuer Subsidiary to be treated as a CFC.
The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert and a court could ultimately hold that some other method of accruing OID should apply.
A U.S. Holder will generally recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of any principal payments on a Class X Note, Class A Note or Class B Note prior to a sale, exchange, or retirement of such Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of each such principal payment (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date any such payment was received) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the equivalent principal amount of the Note (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date the Note was acquired). Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
A U.S. Holder of Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes or Class F Notes generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Debt Obligations. Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, and Class F Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that some other method of accruing OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, or Class F Notes should apply.
It is possible that the Rated Notes could be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, the timing of a U.S. Holder’s OID inclusions could differ from that described above and any gain recognised on the sale, exchange, or retirement of such Notes would be treated as ordinary income and not as capital gain.
As described above under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes”, the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes—Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” with respect to its Class E Notes and Class F Notes.
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes
The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, the Issuer will provide the information necessary for the U.S. Holder to comply with any filing requirements that arise as a result of the Issuer’s classification as a CFC.
U.S. Holder, and not the Issuer, would be required to make a QEF election with respect to each indirect interest in a PFIC. However, certain PFIC information statements are necessary for U.S. Holders that have made QEF elections, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer can obtain such statements from a PFIC, and thus there can be no assurance that a U.S. Holder will be able to make the election with respect to any indirectly held PFIC.
U.S. dollar value of the amount realised. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Holder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a nontaxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.
Receipt of Euro. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Subordinated Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of those euro generally will be ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder that converts the euro into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise ordinary income or loss in respect of the conversion.
U.S. Holders that fail to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a “tolling” of the statute of limitations with respect to their U.S. tax returns. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirements that may apply with respect to their acquisition or ownership of the Subordinated Notes.
A participant in a “reportable transaction” is required to disclose its participation in such a transaction on IRS Form 8886. Any foreign currency exchange loss in excess of $50,000 recognised by a U.S. Holder may be subject to this disclosure requirement. Failure to comply with this disclosure requirement can result in substantial penalties. U.S. Holders should consult their advisors with respect to the requirement to disclose reportable transactions.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
A Non-U.S. Holder that provides an applicable IRS Form W-8, together with all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person, will not be subject to IRS reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding.
4 The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by Moody�s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date. The ratings assigned to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by KBRA address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes by KBRA address the ultimate payment of principal and interest.

Neither the Issuer nor the Collateral Manager will be registered under the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and each purchaser of Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements. See �Plan of Distribution� and �Transfer Restrictions�.
The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Circular and to the best of the knowledge and belief of the Issuer (which has taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), such information is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any similar requirements. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Agents, the Trustee, their respective Affiliates, corporate officers or professional advisers or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is sufficient for such purposes or any other purpose and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to satisfy the requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements, the implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements in their relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. Each prospective investor in the Notes which is subject to the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or any other regulatory requirement should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisers and/or its national regulator to determine whether, and to what extent, such information is sufficient for such purposes and any other requirements of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements or similar requirements of which it is uncertain. See �Risk Factors�Regulatory Initiatives�Risk Retention and Due Diligence Requirements�Securitisation Regulation� below for further information.
In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Transparency Requirements, (a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations, (b) the Collateral Manager will, at the expense of the Issuer, undertake to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information, subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Collateral Manager, reasonably required and in its possession and/or control in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the Competent Authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements (and prior to the adoption of final disclosure templates in respect of the EU Transparency Requirements, the Issuer (with the assistance of the Collateral Administrator and the Collateral Manager) intends to fulfil those requirements contained in subparagraphs (a) and
Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) or, following an acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) by way of the delivery of an Acceleration Notice (actual or deemed), which Acceleration Notice has been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default), and other than in connection with an Optional Redemption in whole pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event), Interest Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Interest Proceeds Priority of Payments, and Principal Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Principal Proceeds Priority of Payments. Upon any redemption in whole of the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) or in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption following Note Tax Event) or, following the delivery of an Acceleration Notice (actual or deemed) in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) which has not been rescinded and annulled in accordance with Condition 10(c) (Curing of Default), Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds will be applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, in each case as described in the Conditions.
The assets securing the Notes will consist predominantly of a portfolio of Secured Senior Loans, Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations, Second Lien Loans and High Yield Bonds managed by BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC, acting through its Series A entity known as BlueMountain A (�Investment Manager�) or (�BlueMountain A�), in its capacity as investment manager, pursuant to the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement (as defined below). BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC (�BlueMountain�) is a series limited liability company organised under Delaware law and each of BlueMountain A and BlueMountain Fuji Management, LLC, acting through its Series B entity known as BlueMountain B (the �Retention Holder�) or (�BlueMountain B�) (through which BlueMountain will hold the Retention Notes) is a series established and existing under Delaware law as part of BlueMountain. BlueMountain A under the terms of the BlueMountain operating agreement is the �originator�, but is not a separately registered legal entity under Delaware law. BlueMountain is the registered legal entity of which BlueMountain A is a series and therefore is considered to be the legal entity that is the �originator� for the purposes of the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements.

The delivery of this Offering Circular at any time does not imply that the information herein is correct at any time subsequent to the date of this Offering Circular or any document or agreement relating to the Notes or any Transaction Document. None of the Investment Manager, the Arranger or the Initial Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for, any matter which is the subject of, any statement, representation, warranty or covenant of the Issuer contained in the Notes or any Transaction Documents, or any other agreement or document relating to the Notes or any Transaction Document, or for the execution, legality, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence thereof.
The Conditions of the Notes oblige the Trustee following receipt of certain certifications from the Issuer, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of the AIFMD (including any implementing regulation, technical standards and guidance related thereto) which may become applicable at a future date.
Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the "Volcker Rule") relevant banking entities are generally prohibited from, among other things, (i) conducting proprietary trading activities in a wide variety of financial instruments unless the transaction is excluded from the scope of the rule and (ii) acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds.
In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds. Full conformance with the Volcker Rule was required from 21 July 2015, and relevant banking entities are required to engage in good faith efforts in this regard during the current conformance period. In general, there is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule.
Any of the above or any other significant change to the setting of LIBOR could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under, (i) any Collateral Debt Obligations which pay interest linked to a LIBOR rate and (ii) the Notes.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.
On 5 October 2015 the OECD released its final recommendations, including in respect of Action 6 and Action 7 though some important issues regarding treaty entitlement have yet to be finalised.
Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.
The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), the Issuer’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.
The market value of the Collateral Debt Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and bonds and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Debt Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.
After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Investment Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Debt Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Investment Management and Collateral Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio — Management of the Portfolio — Following Expiry of the Reinvestment Period”. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Impaired Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Debt Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.

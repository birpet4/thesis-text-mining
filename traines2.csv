The U.S. Risk Retention Rules prohibit the “sponsor” or its “majority-owned affiliates”, as applicable, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the “credit risk” during the period of time that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules required that the risk be retained.",p,

VOLCKER RULE,h3,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes U.S. banking organisations and their affiliates wheresoever located as well as non-U.S. banking organisations that have a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless of where such banking organisation or its affiliates are located) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund”, subject to certain exemptions.",p,
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"In June 2020, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule adopted amendments to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations, including changes relevant to the treatment of securitisations (the “Volcker Changes”). Among other things, the Volcker Changes create additional exclusions from the “covered fund” definition, and narrow the definition of “ownership interest” to exclude certain “senior debt interests”. In addition, under the Volcker Changes, a debt interest is no longer considered an “ownership interest” solely because the holder has the right to remove or replace the manager following a cause-related default. The Volcker Changes became effective on 1 October 2020; however it should be noted that in certain circumstances, an adopted regulation, including but not limited to the Volcker Changes, can be rescinded under the Congressional Review Act if a joint resolution of disapproval is adopted by both houses of Congress within a limited number of days following adoption of the regulation.",p,
"The Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes are issued in subclasses, some of which have voting rights with respect to the removal of, and selection of a replacement for the Collateral Manager, and others of which do not possess such voting rights. Accordingly, U.S. and non U.S. banking entities investing in those classes of Notes will have the option of investing in subclasses that do not by their terms have a right to remove or select the replacement for the Collateral Manager or investing in subclasses which possess such rights. There can be no assurance, however, that owning the Notes of such a subclass without such voting rights (rather than a note of another subclass identical in every respect but for the right to vote to remove or select a replacement for the Collateral Manager) will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer held by U.S. and non U.S. banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule (whether in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes) not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.",p,
"The Class Z Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in ensuring that investments in the Class Z Notes by",p,
U.S. banking institutions and other “banking entities” subject to the Volcker Rule are not characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.,p,
Prospective investors should make their own determinations as to whether their investment qualifies as an “ownership interest”.,p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, then in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,
"Each investor is responsible for analysing its own position under the Volcker Rule and any other similar laws and regulations and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or the Sole Arranger nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Volcker Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor's investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.",p,
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Volcker Rule” below.,p,

"TO THE EFFECT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS, OR THE COLLATERAL MANAGER OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC AS A “COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR” OR A “COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR” (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, AS AMENDED (THE “CEA”) AND CFTC REGULATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE ISSUER. IN THE EVENT THAT TRADING OR ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE HEDGE AGREEMENTS WOULD RESULT IN THE ISSUER’S ACTIVITIES FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A “COMMODITY POOL” AS DEFINED IN THE CEA, THE COLLATERAL MANAGER WOULD EITHER SEEK TO UTILISE ANY AVAILABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR (A “CPO”) OR A COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR (A “CTA”) OR REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA. UTILIZING ANY SUCH EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COLLATERAL MANAGER, AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUER. IF THE COLLATERAL MANAGER IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A CPO OR A CTA, IT WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A REGISTERED CPO OR CTA, WHICH COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE ISSUER AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ISSUER’S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENT ON THE NOTES.",p,
Applicability of EU Law in the UK,h3,

MIFID II Product Governance,h3,
"Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.",p,
PRIIPs Regulation and Prospectus Regulation,h3,
"The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.",p,

RISK FACTORS,h3,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves certain risks, including risks relating to the Collateral securing such Notes and risks relating to the structure and rights of such Notes and the related arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not incur losses or that investors will receive a return on their investments. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the matters set forth elsewhere in this Offering Circular, prior to investing in any Notes. Terms not defined in this section and not otherwise defined above have the meanings set out in Condition 1 (Definitions) of the “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.",p,
1. GENERAL,p,
1.1 General,p,
"It is intended that the Issuer will invest in Collateral Obligations and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below and subject to the investment policies, restrictions and guidelines described in “The Portfolio”. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in the Notes. Except as is otherwise stated below, such risk factors are generally applicable to all Classes of Notes, although the degree of risk associated with each Class of Notes will vary in accordance with the position of such Class of Notes in the Priorities of Payment. See Condition 3(c) (Priorities of Payment). In particular (i) payments in respect of the Class A Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class B-1 Notes, the Class B-2 Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (ii) payments in respect of the Class B Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iii) payments in respect of the Class C Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (iv) payments in respect of the Class D Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (v) payments in respect of the Class E Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; (vi) payments in respect of the Class F Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes; and (vii) payments in respect of the Class Z Notes are generally higher in the Priorities of Payment than those of the Subordinated Notes. None of the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, or the Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger or the Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.",p,
1.2 Suitability,p,
"Prospective purchasers of the Notes of any Class should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting.",p,
1.3 Limited Resources of Funds to Pay Expenses of the Issuer,p,
"The funds available to the Issuer to pay its expenses on any Payment Date are limited as provided in the Priorities of Payment. In the event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and it may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings brought against it or which it might otherwise bring to protect its interests or be able to pay the expenses of legal proceedings against persons it has indemnified.",p,
"Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutory, regulatory and margin requirements. Certain regulators and self-regulatory organisations and exchanges are authorised to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to this transaction and derivative transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be substantial and adverse.",p,
1.5 Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets,p,
"Over the past several years, European financial markets have experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns over economic contraction in certain EU member states (the “Member States”), rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades and risk of default or restructuring of government debt. These events could cause bond yields and credit spreads to increase.",p,
Many European economies continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment. This economic climate may have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt.,p,
"As discussed further in 1.7 “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict, but is likely to be negative. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"Significant risks for the Issuer and investors exist as a result of current economic conditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets or to purchase new assets in the secondary market, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Issue Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and/or the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Notes prior to their Maturity Date, if at all. As well as reducing opportunities for the Issuer to purchase assets in the primary market, this is likely to increase the refinancing risk in respect of maturing assets. Although there have recently been signs that the primary market for certain financial products is recovering, particularly in the United States of America, the impact of the economic crisis on the primary market may adversely affect the flexibility of the Collateral Manager to invest and, ultimately, reduce the returns on the Notes to investors.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"The ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes can depend on the general economic climate and the state of the global economy. The business, financial condition or results of operations of the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations may be adversely affected by a deterioration of economic and business conditions. To the extent that economic and business conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value and collectability of the Collateral Obligations are likely to decrease. A decrease in market value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the Sale Proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Rated Notes, as well as the ability to make any distributions in respect of the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes.",p,
"Many financial institutions, including banks, continue to suffer from capitalisation issues in a regulatory environment which may increase the capital requirement for certain businesses. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is a grantor of a participation in an asset or is a hedge counterparty to a swap or hedge involving the Issuer, or a counterparty to a buy or sell trade that has not settled with respect to an asset. The bankruptcy or insolvency of another financial institution may result in the disruption of payments to the Issuer. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more additional financial institutions may trigger additional crises in the global credit markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer, the Collateral and the Notes.",p,
"The global credit crisis and its consequences together with the perceived failure of the preceding financial regulatory regime, continue to drive legislation and regulators towards a restrictive regulatory environment including the implementation of further regulation which affects financial institutions, markets, instruments and the bond market. Such additional rules and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect Noteholders as well as the flexibility of the Collateral Manager in managing and administering the Collateral. Increasing capital requirements and changing regulations may also result in some financial institutions exiting, curtailing or otherwise adjusting some trading, hedging or investment activities which may have effects on the liquidity of investments such as the Notes as well as the Collateral.",p,
"While it is possible that current conditions may improve for certain sectors of the global economy, there can be no assurance that the CLO, leveraged finance or structured finance markets will recover from an economic downturn at the same time or to the same degree as such other recovering sectors.",p,
COVID-19,p,
"There has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and related respiratory disease (coronavirus disease (COVID-19)) (“COVID-19”), that was first detected in December 2019 and which has now been found in over 200 countries globally. This outbreak and measures being put in place to restrict its spread have disrupted (and may continue to disrupt) economies and slowed (and may continue to slow) economic growth both in countries where the outbreak has been detected and in others. This may result, and in some cases (including in respect of the United Kingdom) has resulted, in the downgrade of certain sovereign credit ratings by certain rating agencies. This has (and may continue to) materially and adversely impact the global supply chain, market and economies. At this time, it remains uncertain whether the outbreak can be contained and what its impact will be in different affected areas, or how disruptive such outbreak and preventive measures may be to the global and regional economies. This state of affairs is causing (and may continue to cause) significant uncertainty in both domestic and global financial markets, has led to (and may continue to cause) volatility and disruption in the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on certain Obligors of Collateral Obligations. These additional risks and market disruptions may materially and adversely affect the ability of Obligors to make payments under Collateral Obligations, the liquidity and value of the Notes, the ratings applicable to Collateral Obligations (see 4.20 “Ratings on Collateral Obligations”), the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes and the Issuer’s ability to acquire and sell Collateral Obligations.",p,
"1.6 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders",p,
"In previous years, events in the collateralised debt obligation (including CLO), leveraged finance and fixed income markets have resulted in substantial fluctuations in prices for leveraged loans and high-yield debt securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. No assurance can be made that conditions giving rise to similar price fluctuations and limited liquidity may not emerge following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer’s ability to acquire or dispose of Collateral Obligations at a price and time that the Issuer deems advantageous may be severely impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is unable to acquire desired positions quickly; and the Issuer’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets may exacerbate losses suffered by the Issuer when Collateral Obligations are sold. Furthermore, significant additional risks for the Issuer and investors in the Notes may exist. Such risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that, after the Issue Date, the prices at which Collateral Obligations can be sold by the Issuer may deteriorate from their purchase price, (ii) the possibility that opportunities for the Issuer to sell its Collateral Obligations in the secondary market, including Credit Risk Obligations, Credit Improved Obligations, and Defaulted Obligations, may be impaired, and (iii) increased illiquidity of the Notes because of reduced secondary trading in CLO securities. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors or otherwise adversely affect Noteholders.",p,
1.7 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,p,
"Investors should carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes. Since the global economic crisis, the deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, has continued to pose risks. This situation has also raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.",p,
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,
"Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk that some countries could leave the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily including as a result of an electoral decision to leave the European Union), and that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a negative impact on the Collateral.",p,
"Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any affected assets), the Issuer, and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.",p,
1.8 The UK’s Withdrawal from the European Union,p,
"On 31 January 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU (as more particularly described below). At this time, the full consequences of such withdrawal are not clear.",p,
"In particular, there is uncertainty as to the final trade arrangements to be put in place following the expiry of the Transition Period (as defined below). Investors should be aware that the Issuer’s risk profile may be materially affected by this uncertainty which might also have an adverse impact on the Portfolio and the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders. Any such potential adverse economic conditions may also affect the ability of the obligors to make payment under the Collateral Obligations which in turn may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to pay interest and repay principal to the Noteholders.",p,
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,
"The negotiated withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK provides for a transition period, commencing on 31 January 2020 and ending at 11.00 p.m. GMT on 31 December 2020 (such period, the “Transition Period”). The UK government has stated that it will not seek such an extension. The negotiated withdrawal agreement states that, unless otherwise provided in the agreement, EU law will be applicable to and in the UK during the Transition Period. Accordingly, during the Transition Period any references in this Offering Circular to the “EU” and its “Member States” in the context of EU legislation and the application thereof shall be interpreted so as to include the UK (except where expressly indicated otherwise).",p,
During the Transition Period negotiations will continue between the UK and the EU in respect of the nature of their future relationship. It is at present unclear what type of future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will be established. It is possible that a new relationship would preserve the applicability of certain EU rules (or equivalent rules) in the UK. At this time it is not possible to state with any certainty to what extent that might be so or when negotiations of such relationship will be finalised.,p,
"Following the end of the Transition Period, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the final trade arrangements to be put in place, substantial amendments to English law may occur and may diverge from the corresponding provisions of EU law applicable after the Transition Period. Consequently, English law may change and differ from EU law and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio, the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects or any potential investors. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Regulatory Risk,p,
"Under the EU single market directives, mutual access rights to markets and market infrastructure exist across the EEA and the mutual recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes applies. In addition, regulated entities licensed or authorised in one EEA jurisdiction may operate on a cross-border basis in other EEA countries without the need for a separate licence or authorisation. There is uncertainty as to how, following the expiry of the Transition Period, the existing passporting regime will apply (if at all). Depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the EEA and the UK, it is likely that, UK regulated entities may, following the expiry of the Transition Period, lose the right to passport their services to EEA countries, and EEA entities may lose the right to reciprocal passporting into the UK. Also, UK entities may no longer have access rights to market infrastructure across the EU and the recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes across the EU may no longer be mutual.",p,
"There can be no assurance that the terms of the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU will include arrangements for the continuation of the existing passporting regime or mutual access rights to market infrastructure and recognition of insolvency, bank recovery and resolution regimes. Such uncertainty could adversely impact the Issuer and, in particular, the ability of third parties to provide services to the Issuer, and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Regulatory Risk – UK Collateral Manager,p,
"If, at the end of the Transition Period, the UK were no longer within the scope of EU Directive 2014/65/EU and EU Regulation 600/2014/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) and an alternative passporting regime or third country recognition of the UK is not in place, then (a) a UK manager such as the Collateral Manager may be unable to continue to provide collateral management services to the Issuer in reliance upon the passporting of relevant regulated services within the EU on a cross-border basis provided for under MiFID II and (b) the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to act as Retention Holder to the extent it was required to hold the retention solely as “sponsor” in accordance with the EU Retention Requirements (even if the Collateral Manager were to remain subject to UK financial services regulation), however, we note that the Collateral Manager intends to act as an “originator” retention holder for the purposes of this transaction. As of the date hereof, an “originator” retention holder is not required to be regulated in the EU in order to act in such capacity.",p,
"MiFID II, which has applied since 3 January 2018, provides (among other things) for the ability for non-EU investment firms to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In order to qualify to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis, non-EU investment firms will be required (i) to be authorised in a third country to provide collateral management services which are regulated under MiFID II (A) in respect of which the European Commission (the “Commission”) has adopted an equivalency decision and (B) where the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has established cooperation arrangements with the relevant competent authorities, and (ii) to be registered with ESMA to do so. It is not possible to guarantee or predict the timing of any Commission equivalency decision, cooperation arrangements or registration by ESMA in relation to the UK.",p,
"However, MiFID II provides certain transitional measures so that third country investment firms may continue to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis in accordance with the relevant national regimes (i) until the time of any Commission equivalency decision and",p,
"(ii) following any Commission equivalency decision, for a maximum of three years.",p,
"The European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 S.I. No. 375 of 2017 (the “2017 MiFID Regulations”) implemented Directive 2014/65/EU into Irish law, effective 3 January 2018. The 2017 MiFID Regulations contain a “safe-harbour” for non-EU investment firms, however, services to ‘retail clients’ (as defined in MiFID II) are excluded.",p,
"Until non-EU investment firms qualify under the MiFID II measures to provide collateral management services in the EU on a cross-border basis, the “safe harbour” provision for non-EU investment firms providing services into Ireland to Irish persons contained in the 2017 MiFID Regulations will apply, provided that:",p,
(a) the non-EU investment firm’s headquarters are in a non-EU country;,p,
(b) the non-EU investment firm is subject to authorisation and supervision in its country of origin and that country observes Financial Action Task Force anti-money laundering recommendations;,p,
(c) there are co-operation agreements in place between the Central Bank of Ireland and the relevant non-EU country; and,p,
(d) the non-EU investment firm’s services are provided only to professional clients or eligible counterparties (i.e. as defined in MiFID II) and are not provided to retail clients.,p,
Market Risk,p,
"Following the result of the referendum on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and its subsequent withdrawal, the financial markets have experienced volatility and disruption. This volatility and disruption may continue or increase, and investors should consider the effect thereof on the market for",p,
securities such as the Notes and on the ability of Obligors to meet their obligations under the Collateral Obligations.,p,
"Investors should be aware that as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, any negotiation between the UK and the EU with respect to their future trading relationship and following the expiry of the Transition Period, changes to legislation may introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instabilities in the financial markets. These uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, the Obligors, the Portfolio, the Collateral Manager and the other parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
Exposure to Counterparties,p,
"The Issuer will be exposed to a number of counterparties (including in relation to any Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions and also each of the Agents) throughout the life of the Notes. Investors should note that following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the end of the Transition Period and depending on the terms of any future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, such counterparties may be unable to perform their obligations due to changes in regulation, including the loss of, or changes to, existing regulatory rights to do cross-border business in the EU or the costs of such transactions with such counterparties may increase. In addition, counterparties may be adversely affected by rating actions or volatile and illiquid markets (including currency markets and bank funding markets) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, therefore increasing the risk that such counterparties may become unable to fulfil their obligations. Such inability could adversely impact the Issuer and could be materially detrimental to Noteholders. For further information on counterparties, see “Counterparty Risk” below.",p,
Ratings actions,p,
"Since the results of the referendum on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU each of S&P, Fitch Ratings Limited (and any successor or successors thereto) (“Fitch”) and Moody’s has downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, each of Fitch and Moody’s has further downgraded the UK’s sovereign credit rating and Fitch has also placed such rating on negative outlook, suggesting possible further negative rating action.",p,
"The credit rating of a country affects the ratings of entities operating in its territory, and in particular the ratings of financial institutions. Accordingly, such downgrades of the UK’s sovereign credit rating and any further downgrade action may trigger downgrades in respect of parties to the Transaction Documents. If a counterparty no longer satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement, the Transaction Documents may require that such counterparty be replaced with an entity that satisfies the relevant Rating Requirement. If rating downgrades are widespread, it may become difficult or impossible to replace counterparties with entities that satisfy the relevant Rating Requirement.",p,
"While the extent and impact of these issues are unknown, investors should be aware that they could have an adverse impact on the Issuer, its service providers, the payment of interest and repayment of principal on the Notes and therefore, the Noteholders. For further information, see “Counterparty Risk” below.",p,
1.9 Third Party Litigation; Limited Funds Available,p,
"Investment activities such as the purchase, selling, holding and participation in voting or the restructuring of Collateral Obligations may subject the Issuer to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’s direction. The expense of defending claims against the Issuer by third parties (including bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, except in the unlikely event that that Issuer is indemnified for such amounts, be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the funds available for distribution and the Issuer’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator and for payment of the Issuer’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited amounts available in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. If such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses",p,
"incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be bought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.",p,
2. REGULATORY INITIATIVES,p,
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be, increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,
"This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S. and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal, investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to invest in the Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. All prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws, rules and regulations (including risk retention laws, rules and regulations that apply currently to the investor, or which may do so in the future), regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve requirements or other consequences. None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Retention Holder and the Collateral Manager nor any of their affiliates makes any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the structure of the Notes is compliant with any applicable legal, regulatory, or other framework (nor regarding the manner in which such a framework applies to any investor’s investment in the Notes).",p,
2.2 Basel III and Basel IV,p,
"Following the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) approved significant changes to the Basel regulatory capital and liquidity framework (such changes being commonly referred to as “Basel III”) and proposed revisions to the securitisation framework including increasing risk weights for asset backed securities. Basel III provided for a substantial strengthening of prior prudential rules, including new requirements intended to reinforce capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks) and to establish a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to transitional and phase-in arrangements for certain requirements (for example, the LCR requirements referred to implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements referred to implementation from January 2018). As implementation of any changes to the Basel framework (including those made via Basel III) required legislation in each jurisdiction, the final rules and the timetable for its implementation in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset-backed securities (for example, as LCR eligible assets or not), may be subject to some level of variation between jurisdictions. It should also be noted that changes to regulatory capital requirements have been introduced for insurance and reinsurance undertakings through jurisdiction specific initiatives, such as the Solvency II framework in the EU.",p,
"In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks",p,
"to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework’s standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,
"Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the changes and requirements described above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described above and any other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
2.3 Risk Retention and Transparency Requirements,p,
Securitisation Regulation – Background,p,
"A regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2401) (the “CRR Amendment Regulation”) to amend Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Council (the “CRR”) and a regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/2402) aiming to create a general European framework for securitisation and a specific framework for “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation (the “Securitisation Regulation”) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 December 2017 and entered into force on the twentieth day thereafter. The Securitisation Regulation applies to securitisations the securities of which are issued on or after 1 January 2019. The CRR Amendment Regulation applied from 1 January 2019 (subject to certain transitional provisions regarding securitisations the securities of which were issued before 1 January 2019).",p,
"There are uncertainties regarding the scope of the obligations in the Securitisation Regulation and the obligations in the technical standards that will be adopted pursuant thereto which will provide details of the requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, as further described below. Most of the relevant technical standards have not yet been adopted.",p,
"Investors should be aware and in some cases are required to be aware of the risk retention and due diligence and transparency requirements in Europe under the Securitisation Regulation which affects certain investors, sponsors, original lenders, originators and securitisation special purpose entities (“SSPEs”) in relation to securitisations issued from and including 1 January 2019 (and of any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), in addition to any other regulatory requirements that are (or may become) applicable to them and/or with respect to their investment in the Notes. Each investor should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator before committing to acquire any Notes to determine whether, and to what extent, the information set out in this Offering Circular and in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of satisfying such requirements.",p,
Due-diligence requirements for Institutional Investors,p,
"The Securitisation Regulation imposes due diligence requirements on various types of EU regulated investors (“Institutional Investors”) including institutions for occupational retirement, credit institutions, alternative investment fund managers who manage or market alternative investment funds in the EU, investment firms as defined in the CRR, insurance and reinsurance undertakings and management companies of UCITS funds (or internally managed UCITS).",p,
"These requirements restrict such Institutional Investors from investing in securitisations unless such investors have verified that, among other things: (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than five per cent. in the securitisation in accordance with Article 6 of the Securitisation Regulation and the risk retention is disclosed to the Institutional Investors in accordance with Article 5 of the Securitisation Regulation; (ii) the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation (as to which, see below) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article; and (iii) where the originator or original lender is established in the EU or the UK, and is not a credit institution or an investment firm (as defined in points (1) and (2) of Article 4(1) of the CRR), the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Securitisation Regulation.",p,
Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR consolidated subsidiaries of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRR may also be subject to these requirements.,p,
"Failure to comply with one or more of the requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those Institutional Investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge in respect of the Notes acquired by the relevant investor.",p,
"Uncertainties in the scope of the EU Retention Requirements, the EU Transparency Requirements and the due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation",p,
Aspects of the requirements and what is or will be required to demonstrate compliance to national regulators remain unclear.,p,
"Each prospective investor in the Notes is required to independently assess and determine whether the information provided herein and in any reports provided to investors in relation to this transaction is sufficient to comply with the EU Retention Requirements, EU Transparency Requirements and investor due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation or any similar requirements and none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Retention Holder, nor any of their respective Affiliates or any other person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the information described herein is sufficient in all circumstances for such purposes or any other purpose or that the structure of the Notes, the Retention Holder (including its holding of the Retention Notes) and the transactions described herein are compliant with the EU Retention Requirements, EU Transparency Requirements and investor due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation, any implementing provisions in respect of the EU Retention Requirements, EU Transparency Requirements and investor due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation in any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements and no such person shall have any liability to any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to any deficiency in such information or any failure of the transactions or structure contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy such requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, investors should be aware that at this time, the EU authorities have published only limited binding guidance relating to the satisfaction of the EU Retention Requirements and the EU Transparency Requirements. Furthermore, any relevant regulator’s views with regard to the EU Retention Requirements and the EU Transparency Requirements may not be based exclusively on technical standards, guidance or other information known at this time.",p,
"Securitisation Regulation, including maximum administrative pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Collateral Manager (as Retention Holder) may materially adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Issuer may materially adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to repay principal and pay interest on the Notes.",p,
"Any changes in the law or regulation, the interpretation or application of any law or regulation or changes in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes for some or all investors may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, may have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. Without limitation to the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the EU Retention Requirements and the EU Transparency Requirements, or the interpretation or application thereof, will not change, and, if any such change is effected, whether such change would affect the regulatory position of current or future investors in the Notes. The Retention Holder does not have an obligation to change the quantum or nature of its holding of the Retention Notes due to any future changes in the EU Retention Requirements or in the interpretation thereof. Any costs incurred by the Issuer in connection with satisfying the requirements of the Securitisation Regulation shall be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses.",p,
"The Securitisation Regulation imposes a direct obligation on the originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than five per cent. A failure by the Retention Holder to comply with the Securitisation Regulation’s direct retention requirements may result in administrative and/or criminal penalties being imposed on the Retention Holder including, in the case of a legal person, maximum administrative pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR 5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or up to 10 per cent. of total annual net turnover. With respect to the commitment of the Retention Holder to retain a material net economic interest in the securitisation, please see the summary set out in “The Retention Holder and EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” below.",p,
Transparency Requirements,p,
"Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation contains transparency requirements (the “EU Transparency Requirements”) that require the originator, sponsor and securitisation special purpose entity (“SSPE”) of a securitisation to make certain prescribed information relating to the securitisation available to investors, competent authorities and, upon request, to potential investors. Article 7 also requires that one of those parties is designated as the reporting entity and the Issuer has been designated as such as further described below.",p,
Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation includes ongoing reporting obligations which include quarterly portfolio level disclosure required under Article 7(1)(a) (“Loan Reports”); quarterly investor reports required under Article 7(1)(e) (“Investor Reports”); any inside information relating to the securitisation that the reporting entity is obliged to make public under the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) under Article 7(1)(f) (“Inside Information”); and any “significant events” under Article 7(1)(g) (“Significant Events”).,p,
"The Loan Reports and the Investor Reports are to be made available simultaneously on a quarterly basis and, at the latest (a) one month after each Payment Date or (b) with respect to any period where no Payment Date occurs quarterly, within one month of (i) the last quarterly date that the Loan Report and Investor Report were provided or (ii) the Issue Date, as applicable. Disclosures relating to any Inside Information and Significant Events are required to be made available without delay.",p,
"On 16 October 2019 the Commission adopted certain technical standards under the EU Transparency Requirements containing detailed draft disclosure templates that are required to be completed with respect to the Loan Reports, Investor Reports and, in relation to public transactions only, Inside Information and Significant Events (the “Transparency RTS”). The Transparency RTS were published",p,
in the Official Journal of the European Union on 3 September 2020 and apply from 23 September 2020. There remains significant uncertainty as to the jurisdictional scope of the reporting requirements contained in the Transparency RTS.,p,
"The originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation must designate amongst themselves one entity to fulfil the disclosure requirements (the “reporting entity”) under the Securitisation Regulation. The Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity in relation to the issuance of the Notes and shall be liable for ensuring the satisfaction of the disclosure requirements. Although the Issuer has undertaken to act as the reporting entity, it should be noted that the Securitisation Regulation’s reporting obligations will apply to both the Collateral Manager as the originator as well as to the Issuer. Any failure by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, or by Collateral Manager, to fulfil the EU Transparency Requirements applicable to them or covenants relating thereto may cause the transaction to be non-compliant with the Securitisation Regulation. If there is a breach of the reporting requirements of Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation, the Collateral Manager could be subject to administrative sanctions, including maximum administrative pecuniary sanctions of at least EUR5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or up to 10 per cent. of its total annual net turnover. Any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Collateral Manager may materially adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents and could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market. The Collateral Manager is required to indemnify the Issuer for Collateral Manager Breaches and the Collateral Manager may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to indemnification from the Issuer in respect of any such pecuniary sanctions levied on the Collateral Manager. See “Description of The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement - Issuer Indemnity” below.",p,
"Prospective investors should also note that any such pecuniary sanction levied on the Issuer will be paid to the Competent Authority on each Payment Date as an Administrative Expense pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Should the amount of the sanction exceed the Senior Expenses Cap in any period, payment in full will be subject to the Issuer making such payment in accordance with the priority of payments and after all amounts due on the Rated Notes have been paid. There is no guarantee that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to pay the sanction in full or in a timely manner and there is no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to agree a payment plan with the regulator so that payments can be spread over several Payment Dates. The regulator may take further action against the Issuer in respect of any outstanding amounts including, for example, imposing daily penalty interest or taking further enforcement action. Any such further actions taken by the regulator, could have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Rated Notes and the return the investors receive on the Rated Notes may be impacted.",p,
"In addition, in relation to the reporting obligations in the EU Transparency Requirements:",p,
(a) the Issuer will be designated as the entity responsible to fulfil such reporting obligations;,p,
"(b) the Collateral Manager will undertake to use its reasonable endeavours to provide to the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer (and any applicable third party reporting entity) any reports, data and other information (or access to such information):",p,
(i) which is in the possession of the Collateral Manager;,p,
"(ii) which is not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on its disclosure (unless the relevant information can be summarised or disclosed in an anonymised form, as appropriate);",p,
"(iv) which is required by the Collateral Administrator and the Issuer in connection with the proper performance by the Issuer, as the reporting entity, of its obligation to make available to the Noteholders, potential investors in the Notes and the competent",p,
authorities the reports and information necessary for the Issuer to fulfil the reporting requirements of the EU Transparency Requirements;,p,
"(c) the Issuer, in consultation with the Collateral Manager, shall procure the compilation of each of the Loan Reports and Investor Reports (each as defined in the Conditions), in each case in the form required by and in accordance with the frequency requirements set out in the EU Transparency Requirements; and",p,
"(d) the Collateral Administrator shall make such Loan Reports and Investor Reports, together with any other information, data and reports (in each case as provided to it and instructed by the Collateral Manager and the Issuer) available to the Relevant Recipients via the Reporting Website or such other method of dissemination as is required by the Securitisation Regulation (as notified to the Collateral Administrator by the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and as agreed with the Collateral Administrator) as provided to it.",p,
"The Collateral Administrator shall not assume any responsibility for the Issuer’s obligations as the entity responsible for fulfilling the reporting obligations under the EU Transparency Requirements. In making available such information, documents and reporting, the Collateral Administrator also assumes no responsibility or liability to any third party, including the Noteholders and potential Noteholders (including for their use and/or onward disclosure of such information, documents and reporting), and shall have the benefit of the powers, protections and indemnities granted to it under the Transaction Documents.",p,
"In addition, the Issuer may incur additional costs and expenses in seeking to comply with such disclosure obligations and certain amendments may be required in relation to the Transaction Documents. Such costs and expenses would be payable by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. In the event that the Issuer is not able to comply with these requirements, the imposition of sanctions or remedial measures on the Issuer may directly and adversely affect the amounts payable under Notes and otherwise affect the performance of the Issuer’s obligations and such non-compliance may also have a negative impact on the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.",p,
"The Issuer shall (with assistance from the Collateral Manager, to the extent reasonably required) notify the Central Bank of Ireland of the transaction described in the Transaction Documents no later than 15 Business Days after the date hereof, which notification shall comply with the Central Bank of Ireland’s guidance in relation to the Irish STS Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall be the entity responsible for submitting the notification to the Central Bank of Ireland.",p,
U.S. Risk Retention Rules,p,
"On October 21, 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. Except with respect to asset-backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require a “sponsor” of asset-backed securities or its “majority-owned affiliate” (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities (the “Minimum Risk Retention Requirement”). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules became effective on December 24, 2016 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by assets other than residential mortgages. As further discussed in the adopting release with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the entity acting as the collateral manager of a collateralized loan obligation transaction (a “CLO”) was initially considered the “sponsor” of such CLO.",p,
"However, on February 9, 2018, a three-judge panel (the “Panel”) of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in The Loan Syndications and Trading Association v. Securities and Exchange Commission and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, No. 1:16-cv-0065 ( the “LSTA Decision”), instructed the District Court for the District of Columbia (the “District Court”) to grant summary judgment in favor of the LSTA on the issue of whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules apply to collateral managers of “open market” CLOs (described in the LSTA Decision as CLOs where assets are acquired from “arms-length negotiations and trading on an open market”) under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Panel’s opinion in the LSTA Decision became effective on April 5, 2018,",p,
"when the District Court entered its order following the issuance of the appellate mandate on April 3, 2018 (the “Mandate”) in respect thereof. As a result of the LSTA Decision, certain CLO managers of “open market CLOs” (including the Collateral Manager) may no longer be required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules because of its role as manager of an “open market CLO”, and there may be no “sponsor” of the securitisation transaction and no party may be required to acquire and retain the Minimum Risk Retention Requirement on the Issue Date in reliance on the Mandate.",p,
"If it is determined that this CLO transaction does not constitute an “open-market CLO” (including as a result of the Collateral Manager’s activities with respect to Originated Assets and the EU Retention Requirements), the Collateral Manager may fail to comply (or not be able to comply) with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, which may have a material adverse effect on the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and/or the market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"Investors will not be entitled to the protections previously afforded by the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that required CLO collateral managers to have “skin in the game” and to comply with certain disclosure obligations specified in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to past or future economic crises, or otherwise, including by adopting new credit risk retention rules for “open market CLOs”, and the effect (and extent) of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted (any such future credit risk retention law, rule or regulation in the U.S. that is applicable to the collateral manager and/or the transaction, as determined by the Collateral Manager (a “New Risk Retention Rule” and together with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, “U.S. Retention Regulations”).",p,
"In the event that the U.S. Retention Regulations become applicable to this transaction in the future, whether as a result of regulatory action or governmental action, the Collateral Manager (or a “majority-owned affiliate” thereof) may be required to acquire additional Notes (either in the secondary market or through an additional issuance of Notes). In addition, in the event that U.S. Retention Regulations become applicable to this transaction in the future, failure to comply with the U.S. Retention Regulations may have an adverse effect on the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates, as such failure could constitute a violation of the Exchange Act (or other statute under which any New Risk Retention Rule is promulgated). Any such failure to comply may result in significant negative reputational consequences and may adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or the Trust Deed or the market value and liquidity of the Notes.",p,
"In the event that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules become applicable to this transaction in the future, the Issuer’s ability to effect any additional issuance of Notes, any Refinancing or any material amendment may be impaired or limited due to the consent rights of the Collateral Manager with respect to each such action. In granting or withholding its consent to any such action to the extent it is required under the Trust Deed with respect thereto, it should be expected that the Collateral Manager will act in its own self-interest (and will not take into account the interests of any other Person, including the Issuer and/or any holders of Notes).",p,
The statements contained herein regarding the U.S. Risk Retention Rules and the LSTA Decision are based on publicly available information solely as of the date of this Offering Circular. To the extent the,p,
"U.S. Risk Retention Rules (or any New Risk Retention Rules) apply after the date hereof, the ultimate interpretation as to whether any action taken by an entity complies with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (or such New Risk Retention Rules) will be a matter of interpretation by the applicable governmental authorities or regulators.",p,
"All investors whose investment activities are subject to investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
Japanese Retention Requirements,p,
"On March 15, 2019, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”) published a rule (the “JFSA Securitization Regulation”) concerning the regulatory capital treatment of securitization transactions for Japanese banks, bank holding companies, certain Japanese credit unions and cooperatives and certain other Japanese financial institutions and their respective affiliates (such investors, “Affected Japanese Investors”). The JFSA Securitization Regulation subjects Affected Japanese Investors to punitive capital charges and/or other regulatory penalties for securitization exposures they purchase after March 31, 2019 unless the applicable investor (i) has conducted satisfactory due diligence on the assets underlying such securitization, including the establishment and utilization of a due diligence system for evaluating securitized products and (ii) has determined that either (a) the underlying assets of the applicable securitization transaction were “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” or (b) the relevant “originator” (as defined in the JFSA Securitization Regulation), or another party “deeply involved in the organization of the securitized product”, retains at least 5% of the securitized exposures. At this time there are several unresolved questions relating to the JFSA Securitization Regulation (for which no official English translation is yet available) and little guidance on many aspects of the rule including, among others, (i) what is meant by assets “not inadequately or inappropriately formed” and what materials an Affected Japanese Investor may be required to review to make such a determination, (ii) the eligibility requirements for a retention holder for purposes of the rule and (iii) on what basis to calculate the 5% retention requirement (i.e., how to determine the amount of “securitized exposures”).",p,
The JFSA Securitization Regulation is expected to apply to Affected Japanese Investors investing in the Notes and potentially to any securities issued in connection with a Refinancing or additional issuance of Notes purchased by Affected Japanese Investors.,p,
"The JFSA Securitization Regulation may lead to decreased participation of Affected Japanese Investors in the market for CLO securities, which may adversely affect (i) the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market, (ii) the leveraged loan and CLO markets generally and (iii) the ability of the Issuer to effect a Refinancing and/or additional issuance of Notes.",p,
"Notwithstanding the fact that the Retention Holder is purchasing on the Issue Date and retaining Notes of each Class with the intention of satisfying the EU Retention Requirements, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that such retention would enable any Affected Japanese Investor to comply with the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,
"Furthermore, no party including, without limitation, the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation, warranty or guaranty that the Collateral Obligations were not, or will not be, “inadequately or inappropriately formed”, that the information made available with respect to the Collateral Obligations is sufficient to make such a determination or that this transaction otherwise satisfies the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,
"It is the responsibility of each Affected Japanese Investor to conduct adequate due diligence to confirm and verify that the requirements of the JFSA Securitization Regulation have been satisfied and none of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or the Trustee assumes any responsibility or liability for the failure of any Affected Japanese Investor to conduct the due diligence that is necessary to satisfy the JFSA Securitization Regulation.",p,
2.4 European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR),p,
"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation EU 648/2012 as amended from time to time (“EMIR”) and its various delegated regulations and technical standards impose a range of obligations on parties to “over the counter” (“OTC”) derivative contracts according to whether they are “financial counterparties” (“FCs”) (such as certain investment firms, alternative investment funds (in respect of which, see Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive below), credit",p,
institutions and insurance companies) “non-financial counterparties” (“NFCs”) (or third country entities equivalent to FCs or NFCs).,p,
Types of entities and obligations,p,
"EMIR sets out thresholds for entities to assist with the categorisation thereof: (i) in the case of NFCs, the aggregate month-end average position for the previous 12 months of all OTC derivative contracts entered into by the NFC and other non-financial entities within its “group” (as defined in EMIR), excluding eligible hedging transactions, does not exceed certain thresholds (set per asset class of OTC derivatives), however, once the threshold for one asset class is exceeded, the NFC will be categorised as an NFC+ and (ii), in the case of FCs, the same thresholds apply, but FCs: (A) cannot exclude their hedging transactions from the threshold calculations, and (B) once the threshold for one asset class is exceeded, the FC must clear all OTC derivatives via an authorised or recognised central counterparty. FCs and NFCs, in each case, which are above the “clearing threshold” (“FC+s” and “NFC+s” respectively) are subject to an obligation to clear through an authorised or recognised central counterparty (the “clearing obligation”) all “eligible” OTC derivative contracts entered into with other counterparties (NFC+s need only clear those asset classes in respect of which the clearing threshold is exceeded). All counterparties must report the details of all derivative contracts to a trade repository (the “reporting obligation”) (provided that from 18 June 2020, FCs have been responsible under EMIR for reporting in connection with OTC derivative contracts on behalf of both themselves and their NFC counterparties that are not subject to the clearing obligation, and accordingly, each Hedge Counterparty will be required to report details of any relevant Hedge Transactions for both itself and the Issuer) and undertake certain risk-mitigation techniques in respect of OTC derivative contracts which are not cleared by a central counterparty such as timely confirmation of terms, portfolio reconciliation and compression and the implementation of dispute resolution procedures (the “risk mitigation obligations”). Non-cleared OTC derivatives entered into by FCs and NFC+s must also be marked-to-market on a daily basis and collateral may be required to be exchanged (the “margin requirement”) to the extent that the FC or NFC+ enters into OTC derivatives transactions with other counterparties subject to the margin requirement.",p,
"NFCs which are below such “clearing threshold” (each, an “NFC-”) and small financial counterparties (as described under EMIR) are not subject to the clearing obligation. An NFC- is also exempted from certain additional risk mitigation obligations, such as the posting of collateral.",p,
Margin requirement,p,
"The margin requirement applies to non- cleared OTC derivatives. The margin requirement applies to FCs and NFC+s which transact with other FCs, NFC+s and third country equivalents (subject to exemptions) and, depending on the counterparty, will require collection and posting of variation margin and, for the largest counterparties/groups, initial margin. Variation margin requirements already apply and initial margin requirements are taking effect through a staged implementation period.",p,
"Under EMIR, NFCs may choose to calculate their aggregate month-end average positions for the previous 12 months. However, if an entity (such as the Issuer) is classified as NFC-, it is important that the calculation is made to avoid any concern or questions arising relating to the correct classification of the entity as an NFC-.",p,
"The Issuer expects to be an NFC-. However, if the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and/or if the aggregate month-end average position of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non-financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement. Also, please see 2.5 “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive” below in respect of the potential classification of the Issuer as an AIF.",p,
"Prospective investors should be aware that if the Issuer becomes subject to the clearing obligation or to the margin requirement, it is unlikely that it would be able to comply with such requirements, which",p,
"would adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into or materially amend Hedge Transactions (and may also lead to termination of existing Hedge Transactions and/or Hedge Agreements) and/or may significantly increase the cost of entering into derivative contracts (to the extent that the Issuer is reclassified as a FC or NFC+ and becomes subject to marking to market and collateral posting requirements in respect of non-cleared OTC derivatives such as the Currency Hedge Transactions and the Interest Rate Hedge Transactions). These changes may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions and therefore the Issuer’s ability to acquire Non-Euro Obligations and manage interest rate risk. As a result of such increased costs and/or additional regulatory requirements, investors may receive significantly less or no interest or return, as the case may be, as the Collateral Manager may not be able to execute its investment strategy as anticipated. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by EMIR in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
The Hedge Agreements may also contain early termination events which are based on the application of EMIR and which may allow the relevant Hedge Counterparty to terminate a Hedge Transaction upon the occurrence of an adverse EMIR related event. The termination of a Hedge Transaction in these circumstances may result in a termination payment being payable by the Issuer. See “Hedging Arrangements”.,p,
"The Conditions permit the Issuer to amend, modify and/or supplement any Transaction Document and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to consent to the making of such amendment, modification or supplement to the Transaction Documents which the Issuer certifies are required to comply with the requirements of EMIR which may become applicable in the future.",p,
2.5 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,p,
"EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) introduced authorisation and regulatory requirements for managers of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). If the Issuer were to be considered to be an AIF within the meaning in AIFMD, it would need to be managed by a manager authorised under AIFMD (an “AIFM”). The Collateral Manager is not authorised under AIFMD but is authorised under MiFID II. As the Collateral Manager is not permitted to be authorised under both AIFMD and under MiFID II, it will not be able to apply for an authorisation under AIFMD unless it gives up its authorisation under MiFID II (in which case it may not be able to hold the retention as a “sponsor”, although the Collateral Manager shall hold the retention as “originator” under the EU Retention Requirements (see 2.3 “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Transparency Requirements – EU Retention and Transparency Requirements”) above). If considered to be an AIF managed by an authorised AIFM, the Issuer would also be classified as an FC under EMIR and may be required to comply with the EMIR clearing obligation and/or risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives contracts (including obligations to exchange margin) with respect to Hedge Transactions (under the Proposal, all AIFs will be FCs whether or not managed by an authorised AIFM). See also 2.4 “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above.",p,
"There is an exemption from the definition of AIF in AIFMD for “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”). The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it. However, as regards the position in Ireland, the Central Bank has confirmed that pending such further clarification from ESMA, “registered financial vehicle corporations” with the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 24/2009 of the European Central Bank (which has now been recast pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank), such as the Issuer, do not need to seek authorisation as an AIF or appoint an AIFM unless the Central Bank issues further guidance advising them to do so.",p,
"If the SSPE Exemption does not apply and the Issuer is considered to be an AIF, the Collateral Manager may not be able to continue to manage the Issuer’s assets, or its ability to do so may be impaired. As a result, any application of the AIFMD may affect the return investors receive from their investment.",p,
"The Conditions of the Notes allow the Issuer and oblige the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Noteholders, to concur with the Issuer in the making of modifications to the Transaction Documents",p,
and/or the Conditions of the Notes to comply with the requirements of AIFMD which may become applicable at a future date.,p,
2.6 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act,p,
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the",p,
"U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Issuer and the businesses of the Collateral Manager and its subsidiaries and affiliates, will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and come into effect.",p,
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed changes to Regulation AB (as defined under the Securities Act) under the Securities Act which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on securities offerings pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. Such rules, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a new prospectus in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any Refinancing. On 27 August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals. However, the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. If such amendments are made to Regulation AB in the future, they may place additional requirements and expenses on the Issuer in the event of the issuance and sale of any additional notes, which expenses may reduce the amounts available for distribution to the Noteholders.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger makes any representation as to such matters. As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks posed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any investment decision in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.7 CFTC Regulations,p,
"Pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators in the United States have promulgated and continue to promulgate a range of new regulatory requirements that may affect the pricing, terms and compliance costs associated with the entry into any Hedge Transaction by the Issuer and the availability of such Hedge Transactions. Some or all of the Hedge Transactions that the Issuer may enter into may be affected by U.S. derivatives requirements, including: (i) the requirement that certain swaps be centrally cleared and traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, (ii) initial or variation margin requirements of any central clearing organisation (with respect to cleared swaps) or initial or variation margin requirements with respect to uncleared swaps, (iii) swap reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other matters. These new requirements may (x) significantly increase the cost to the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager of entering into Hedge Transactions such that the Issuer may be unable to purchase certain types of Collateral Obligations, (y) have unforeseen legal consequences on the Issuer or the Collateral Manager or (z) have other material adverse effects on the Issuer or the Noteholders.",p,
"Furthermore, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and prudential regulator regulations requiring the posting of variation margin on certain types of uncleared swaps entered into by entities such as the Issuer entered into effect in late 2017. Margin regulations have also been adopted by the SEC, but compliance with such regulations will not be required for in-scope entities until October",p,
"2021 at the earliest. Hedge Transactions may be subject to such requirements, depending on the identity of the Hedge Counterparty and the type of transaction. The Trust Deed does not permit the Issuer to post variation margin. Accordingly, the application of United States regulations to a Hedge Transaction or a proposed Hedge Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to hedge its interest or currency rate exposure, or on the cost of such hedging.",p,
2.8 Commodity Pool Regulation,p,
"The Issuer’s ability to enter into Hedge Transactions may cause the Issuer to be a “commodity pool” as defined in the United States Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (“CEA”) and the Collateral Manager to be a “commodity pool operator” (“CPO”) and/or a “commodity trading advisor” (a “CTA”), each as defined in the CEA in respect of the Issuer. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines a “commodity pool” to include certain investment vehicles operated for the purpose of trading in “commodity interests” which includes swaps. CPOs and CTAs are subject to regulation by the CFTC and must register with the CFTC unless an exemption from registration is available. Based on applicable CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and as such, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into Hedge Agreements (or any other agreement that would fall within the definition of “swap” as set out in the CEA) following receipt of legal advice from reputable counsel to the effect that the entry into such arrangements should not require any of the Issuer, its directors or officers, the Collateral Manager or any of its directors, officers or employees to register with the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CPO or a CTA with the CFTC with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"In the event that trading or entering into one or more Hedge Agreements would result in the Issuer’s activities falling within the definition of a “commodity pool”, the Collateral Manager may cause the Issuer to be operated in compliance with the exemption set forth in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) for CPOs to pools whose interests are sold to qualifying investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and that limit transactions in commodity interests to the trading thresholds set forth in the Rule. Specifically, under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), the Issuer would be required to limit transactions in commodity interests so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the Issuer’s assets is used as margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the Issuer’s positions in commodity interests does not exceed 100% of the Issuer’s liquidation value. If the Collateral Manager elects to file for a registration exemption under CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a CFTC-registered CPO, the Collateral Manager would not be required to deliver a CFTC-mandated disclosure document or a certified annual report to investors, or otherwise comply with the requirements applicable to CFTC-registered CPOs and CTAs. Utilising any such exemption from registration may impose additional costs on the Collateral Manager and the Issuer and may significantly limit the Collateral Manager’s ability to engage in hedging activities on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the CFTC guidance referred to above changes or the Issuer engages in one or more activities that might cause it to fall within the definition of a “commodity pool” under the CEA and no exemption from registration is available, registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO or a CTA may be required before the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on the Issuer’s behalf) may enter into any Hedge Agreement. Registration of the Collateral Manager as a CPO and/or a CTA could cause the Collateral Manager to be subject to extensive compliance and reporting requirements that would involve material costs which may be passed on to the Issuer. The scope of such compliance costs is uncertain but could adversely affect the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes.",p,
"Further, if the Collateral Manager determines that additional Hedge Transactions should be entered into by the Issuer in excess of the trading limitations set forth in any applicable exemption from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA, the Collateral Manager may elect to withdraw its exemption from registration and instead register with the CFTC as the Issuer’s CPO and/or CTA. The costs of obtaining and maintaining these registrations and the related compliance obligations may be paid by the Issuer as Administrative Expenses. Such costs would reduce the amount of funds available to make payments on the Notes. These costs are uncertain and could be materially greater than the Collateral Manager anticipated when deciding to enter into the transaction and register as a CPO and/or a CTA. In addition,",p,
"it may not be possible or advisable for the Collateral Manager to withdraw from registration as a CPO and/or a CTA after any relevant swap transactions terminate or expire. The costs of CPO and/or CTA registration and the ongoing CPO and/or CTA compliance obligations of the Collateral Manager could exceed, perhaps significantly, the financial risks that are being hedged pursuant to any Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Neither the CFTC nor the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) pass upon the merits of participating in a pool or upon the adequacy or accuracy of offering memoranda. Consequently, neither the CFTC not the NFA has reviewed or approved this Offering Circular or any related subscription agreement.",p,
2.9 Volcker Rule,p,
"Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”) prevents “banking entities” (a term which includes affiliates of a U.S. banking organisation as well as affiliates of a foreign banking organisation that has a branch or agency office in the U.S., regardless where such affiliates are located) from",p,
"(i) engaging in proprietary trading in financial instruments, or (ii) acquiring or retaining any “ownership interest” in, or in “sponsoring”, a “covered fund”, subject to certain exemptions.",p,
"An “ownership interest” is defined widely and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profits and losses of the “covered fund”, as well as through certain rights of the holder to participate in the selection or removal of an investment advisor, investment manager, or general partner, trustee, or member of the board of directors of the “covered fund”. A “covered fund” is defined widely, and includes any issuer which would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 (the “ICA”) but is exempt from registration solely in reliance on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, subject to certain exemptions found in the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations.",p,
"It should be noted that a commodity pool as defined in the CEA (see 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation”, above) could, depending on which CEA exemption is used by such commodity pool or its commodity pool operator, also fall within the definition of a covered fund as described above.",p,
"In June 2020, the five federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule adopted amendments to the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations, including changes relevant to the treatment of securitisations (the “Volcker Changes”). Among other things, the Volcker Changes create additional exclusions from the “covered fund” definition, and narrow the definition of “ownership interest” to exclude certain “senior debt interests”. In addition, under the Volcker Changes, a debt interest is no longer considered an “ownership interest” solely because the holder has the right to remove or replace the manager following a cause-related default. The Volcker Changes became effective on 1 October 2020; however it should be noted that in certain circumstances, an adopted regulation, including but not limited to the Volcker Changes, can be rescinded under the Congressional Review Act if a joint resolution of disapproval is adopted by both houses of Congress within a limited number of days following adoption of the regulation.",p,
"The Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes are issued in subclasses, some of which have voting rights with respect to the removal of, and selection of a replacement for the Collateral Manager, and others of which do not possess such voting rights. Accordingly, U.S. and non U.S. banking entities investing in those classes of Notes will have the option of investing in subclasses that do not by their terms have a right to remove or select the replacement for the Collateral Manager or investing in subclasses which possess such rights. There can be no assurance, however, that owning the Notes of such a subclass without such voting rights (rather than a note of another subclass identical in every respect but for the right to vote to remove or select a replacement for the Collateral Manager) will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer held by U.S. and non U.S. banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule (whether in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes or CM Exchangeable Non-Voting Notes) not being characterised as “ownership interests” in the Issuer.",p,
"The Class Z Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that this feature will be effective in ensuring that",p,
investments in the Class Z Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other “banking entities” subject to the Volcker Rule are not characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.,p,
Prospective investors should make their own determinations as to whether their investment qualifies as an “ownership interest”.,p,
"If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund” the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions will severely limit the ability of “banking entities” to hold an “ownership interest” in the Issuer. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in “ownership interests” of the Issuer should consult its own legal advisors and consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment. If investment by “banking entities” in the Notes of any Class is prohibited or restricted by the Volcker Rule, this could impair the marketability and liquidity of such Notes.",p,
No assurance can be made as to the effect of the Volcker Rule on the ability of certain investors subject thereto to acquire or retain an interest in the Notes. Each prospective investor in the Notes should independently consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of any investment in the Notes. Investors should conduct their own analysis to determine whether the Issuer is a “covered fund” for their purposes.,p,
2.10 Reliance on Rating Agency Ratings,p,
"The Dodd-Frank Act requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings, including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. Investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Changes in capital requirements have been announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and it is uncertain when all such changes will be fully implemented. When such regulations are fully implemented, investments in asset-backed securities like the Notes by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own such securities, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of such securities for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, all prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other regulatory restrictions, unfavourable accounting treatment, capital charges or reserve requirements.",p,
2.11 Flip Clauses,p,
"The validity and enforceability of certain provisions in contractual priorities of payments which purport to alter the priority in which a particular secured creditor is paid as a result of the occurrence of one or more specified trigger events, including the insolvency of such creditor (“flip clauses”), have been challenged recently in the English and U.S. courts on the basis that the operation of a flip clause as a result of such creditor’s insolvency breaches the “anti-deprivation” principles of English and U.S. insolvency law. This principle prevents a party from agreeing to a provision that deprives its creditors of an asset upon its insolvency.",p,
"The English Supreme Court has, in Belmont Park Investments Pty Limited v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. [2011] UKSC 38, upheld the validity of a flip clause contained in an English-law governed security document, stating that the anti-deprivation principle was not breached by such provisions.",p,
"In the U.S. courts, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited. (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Adv. Pro. No. 09-1242-JMP (Bankr S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009) examined a flip clause contained in an indenture related to a swap agreement and held that such a provision, which seeks to modify one creditor’s position in a priority of payments when that creditor files for bankruptcy, is unenforceable",p,
"under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Judge Peck also found that the Code’s safe harbour provisions, which protect certain contractual rights under swap agreements, did not apply to the flip clause because the flip clause provisions were contained in the indenture, and not in the swap agreement itself. Judge Peck acknowledged that this has resulted in the U.S. courts coming to a decision “directly at odds with the judgement of the English Courts”. While BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd filed a motion for and was granted leave to appeal with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case was settled before the appeal was heard.",p,
"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), 553 B.R. 476 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were ipso facto clauses which, in the absence of safe harbour protection, are unenforceable under the Code. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s holding that priority of distribution was a part of the liquidation of a swap agreement and therefore protected by the Code’s safe harbour provisions was affirmed on appeal by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on 14 March 2018 (Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), No. 17 CIV. 1224 (LGS), 2018 WL 1322225 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2018))",p,
"and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 11 August 2020 (Lehman Bros. Special Fin. Inc. v. Branch Banking and Tr. Co. (In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.), No. 18-1079, 2020 WL 4590247 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2020)) These judgments highlight the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,
"The flip clause examined in the Belmont case is similar in substance to the relevant provisions in the Priorities of Payment, however the context and manner of subordination which may be applied to a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with such provisions will not be identical; and the judgments in Belmont and subsequent litigation in which the same rule has been applied have noted that English law questions relating to the anti-deprivation principle will be determined on the basis of the particular terms at hand and their commercial context. As such, it is not necessarily settled that the particular flip clauses contained in the Priorities of Payment would certainly be enforceable as a matter of English law, in the case of insolvency of a Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"Moreover, if the Priorities of Payment are the subject of litigation in any jurisdiction outside England and Wales, in particular in the United States of America, and such litigation results in a conflicting judgment in respect of the binding nature of the Priorities of Payment, it is possible that termination payments due to the Hedge Counterparties would not be subordinated as envisaged by the Priorities of Payment and as a result, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Noteholders in full may be adversely affected. There is a particular risk of such conflicting judgments where a Hedge Counterparty is the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside England and Wales.",p,
2.12 LIBOR and EURIBOR Reform,p,
"The London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has been reformed, with developments including:",p,
(a) the activities of administering a specified benchmark and of providing information in relation to a specified benchmark becoming regulated activities in the United Kingdom (LIBOR has been a specified benchmark since April 2013);,p,
(b) ICE Benchmark Administration Limited becoming the LIBOR administrator in place of the British Bankers’ Association in February 2014;,p,
(c) a reduction in the number of currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated; and,p,
(d) the introduction of a LIBOR code of conduct for contributing banks.,p,
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited intends to make further reforms to the submission methodology for LIBOR panel banks.,p,
"In a speech on 27 July 2017, Andrew Bailey, the Chief Executive of the FCA, announced the FCA’s intention to cease sustaining LIBOR from the end of 2021.",p,
"The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR where necessary. The FCA has decided not to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit contributions to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. The FCA has indicated that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain LIBOR until the end of 2021. The FCA’s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to persuade, or to compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR through using its influence or legal powers beyond that date.",p,
"It is possible that the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR on the current basis after 2021, if they are willing and able to do so. However, the survival of LIBOR in its current form, or at all, is not guaranteed after 2021. If LIBOR does not survive in its current form or at all, this could adversely affect the value of, and amounts payable under, any Collateral Obligations which pay interest calculated with reference to LIBOR and therefore reduce amounts which may be available to the Issuer to pay Noteholders. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will survive in its current form or at all may lead to adverse market conditions, which may have an adverse effect on the amounts available to the Issuer to pay to Noteholders.",p,
"The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (for the purposes of this risk factor, “EURIBOR”), together with LIBOR, and other so-called “benchmarks” are the subject of reform measures by a number of international authorities and other bodies.",p,
"In the EU, in September 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and entered into force on 30 June 2016. The application date for the majority of its provisions was 1 January 2018. It is directly applicable law across the EU.",p,
"The Benchmarks Regulation applies principally to “administrators” and also, in some respects, to “contributors” and certain “users” of “benchmarks”, and will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime) and make significant changes to the way in which benchmarks falling within scope of the Benchmarks Regulation are governed (including reforms of governance and control arrangements, obligations in relation to input data, certain transparency and record-keeping requirements and detailed codes of conduct for contributors) and (ii) prevent certain uses of “benchmarks” provided by unauthorised administrators by supervised entities in the EU. The scope of the Benchmarks Regulation is wide and, in addition to so-called “critical benchmark” indices, could also potentially apply to many interest rate and foreign exchange rate indices, equity indices and other indices (including “proprietary” indices or strategies) where used to determine the amount payable under or the value or performance of certain financial instruments traded on a trading venue, financial contracts and investment funds. EURIBOR and LIBOR have been designated “critical benchmarks” for the purposes of the Benchmarks Regulation, by way of European Commission Implementing Regulations published on 12 August 2016 and 28 December 2017, respectively.",p,
"Benchmarks such as EURIBOR or LIBOR may be discontinued if they do not comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the benchmark either fails to apply for authorisation or is refused authorisation by its home regulator. On 2 July 2019, the European Money Markets Institute, administrator for EURIBOR, was granted authorisation under the Benchmarks Regulation by the Financial Services and Markets Authority of Belgium. EURIBOR is now considered compliant with the Benchmarks Regulation.",p,
Potential effects of the Benchmarks Regulation include (among other things):,p,
"(a) an index which is a “benchmark” could not be used by a supervised entity in certain ways if its administrator does not obtain authorisation or, if based in a non-EU or non-UK jurisdiction, the administrator is not otherwise recognised as equivalent; and",p,
"(b) the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” could be changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmarks Regulation, and such changes could (among other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.",p,
Investors should be aware that:,p,
"(a) any of the international, national or other measures or proposals for reform, or general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks” could have a material adverse effect on the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or participate in certain “benchmarks”, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the disappearance of certain “benchmarks”;",p,
"(b) any of these changes or any other changes could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be;",p,
(c) if the applicable rate of interest on any Collateral Obligation is calculated with reference to a benchmark (or currency or tenor) which is discontinued:,p,
"(i) such rate of interest will then be determined by the provisions of the affected Collateral Obligation, which may include determination by the relevant calculation agent in its discretion; and",p,
"(ii) there may be a mismatch between the replacement rate of interest applicable to the affected Collateral Obligation and the replacement rate of interest the Issuer must pay under any applicable Hedge Agreement. This could lead to the Issuer receiving amounts from affected Collateral Obligations which are insufficient to make the due payment under the Hedge Agreement, and potential termination of the Hedge Agreement;",p,
"(d) if any of the relevant EURIBOR benchmarks referenced in Condition 6 (Interest) is discontinued, interest on the Rated Notes will be calculated under Condition 6(e) (Interest on the Rated Notes). In general, fall-back mechanisms which may govern the determination of interest rates where a benchmark rate is not available (such as those described in paragraph (c) immediately above) are not suitable for long term use. Accordingly, in the event a benchmark rate is permanently discontinued, it may be desirable to amend the applicable interest rate provisions in the affected Collateral Obligation, Hedge Agreement or the Notes. Investors should note that the Issuer may, in certain circumstances, amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the reference rate in respect of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders to certain Alternative Base Rates set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver), provided that an amendment to any other rate not already set out in paragraph (LL) of Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) shall require a consent of the Controlling Class and the Subordinated Noteholders within the timescale provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification",p,
"and Waiver), in each case, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver); and",p,
(e) the administrator of a relevant benchmark will not have any involvement in the Collateral Obligations or the Notes and may take any actions in respect of such benchmark without regard to the effect of such actions on the Collateral Obligations or the Rated Notes.,p,
"Any of the above or any other significant changes to EURIBOR or any other benchmark could have a material adverse effect on the value of, and the amount payable under (i) any Collateral Obligations which pay interest linked to a EURIBOR rate or other benchmark (as applicable), and (ii) the Notes (other than the Class B-2 Notes).",p,
2.13 Financial Transaction Tax,p,
"In February 2013 the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission Proposal”) for a Council Directive implementing enhanced cooperation for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) requested by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, save for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”). On 16 March 2016, Estonia completed the formalities required to cease participation in the enhanced cooperation on FTT.",p,
"Under the Commission Proposal, the proposed FTT would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State or the financial instrument in which the parties are dealing is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may apply to both transaction parties where one of these circumstances applies. The FTT may also apply to dealings in the Collateral to the extent the Collateral constitutes financial instruments within its scope, such as bonds. In such circumstances, it is not possible to predict with certainty what effect the proposed FTT might have on the business of the Issuer, there will be no gross-up by any party to the transaction and amounts due to Noteholders may be adversely affected.",p,
"Certain aspects of the Commission Proposal are controversial and, while the Commission Proposal initially identified the date of introduction of the FTT across the Participating Member States as being 1 January 2014, this anticipated introduction date has been extended on several occasions due to disagreement among the Participating Member States regarding a number of key issues concerning the scope and application of the FTT. Accordingly, the date of implementation of the FTT remains uncertain. Additional Member States may also decide to participate in the FTT. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to any FTT and its potential impact on their dealings in the Notes before investing.",p,
"2.14 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism, Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Similar Laws May Require Certain Actions or Disclosures",p,
"Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “AML Requirements”). Any of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee or the Agents could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. It is expected that each of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith. A Noteholder may also be obliged to provide information they may have previously identified or regarded as confidential to satisfy the Issuer AML Requirements.",p,
2.15 CRA,p,
Regulation (EU) 462/2013 of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending Regulation EC 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (“CRA3”) came into force on 20 June 2013. CRA3 has subsequently been supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/3 of 30 September 2014 (the “CRA3 RTS”).,p,
"Article 8(c) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to solicit a credit rating of a structured finance instruments, it shall obtain two independent ratings for such instruments. Article 8(d) of CRA3 has introduced a requirement that where an issuer or a related third party intends to appoint at least two credit rating agencies to rate the same instrument, the issuer or a related third party shall consider appointing at least one rating agency having less than a 10 per cent. market share among agencies capable of rating that instrument. The Issuer intends to have two rating agencies appointed, but does not make any representation as to market share of either agency, and any consequences for the Issuer, related third parties and investors if an agency does not have a less than 10 per cent. market share are not specified. Investors should consult their legal advisors as to the applicability of CRA3 and any consequence of non-compliance in respect of their investment in the Notes.",p,
2.16 Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,p,
"On 5 October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published final reports, analyses and sets of recommendations for all of the fifteen actions it identified as part of its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) , which G20 finance ministers then endorsed during a meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru (the “Final Report”). The Final Report was endorsed by G20 Leaders during their annual summit on 15-16 November 2015 in Antalya, Turkey.",p,
"The focus of one of the actions (Action 6) is the prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The Final Report recommends, as a minimum, that countries should include in their tax treaties: (i) an express statement that the common intention of each contracting state which is party to such treaties is to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance; and one, or both, of (ii) a “limitation-on-benefits” (“LOB”) rule; and (iii) a “principal purposes test” (“PPT”) rule.",p,
"The PPT rule could deny a treaty benefit (such as a reduced rate of withholding tax) if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty.",p,
"On 24 November 2016, the OECD published the text and explanatory statement of the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting”, developed by an ad hoc group of 99 countries which included Ireland and the UK (the “Multilateral Instrument”). The Multilateral Instrument is to be applied alongside existing tax treaties (rather than amending them directly), modifying the application of those existing treaties in order to implement BEPS measures.",p,
"The United Kingdom and Ireland signed the Multilateral Instrument with both countries indicating that the double tax treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and Ireland is to be designated as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”), being a tax treaty that is to be modified by the Multilateral Instrument. The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 June 2018 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2018. Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification with the OECD on 29 January 2019 and therefore the Multilateral Instrument came into force in respect of Ireland on 1 May 2019. In the case of the UK- Ireland double tax treaty, this change has effect in relation to withholding taxes from 1 January 2020 and for other taxes from 1 November 2019.",p,
"Upon ratifying the Multilateral Instrument the United Kingdom and Ireland each provided a list of reservations and notifications to be made pursuant to it. Based on the information contained in these documents and the Multilateral Instrument, Action 6 would be implemented into the CTAs Ireland has entered into with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions which have ratified the Multilateral Instrument by the inclusion of a PPT.",p,
"In particular it remains to be seen what will be the impact of the specific changes that will be made to the UK-Ireland double tax treaty and any other double tax treaty on which the Issuer may rely (for example, in receiving interest from an overseas borrower at a potentially reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable double tax treaty). A change in the application or interpretation of these double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the recommendations of the Final Report by way of the Multilateral Instrument or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable permanent establishment outside of Ireland, in denying the Issuer the benefit of Ireland’s network of double tax treaties or in other tax consequences for the Issuer. In each case, this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business, tax and financial position.",p,
It is also possible that Ireland will negotiate other bespoke amendments to its double tax treaties on a bilateral basis in the future which may affect the ability of the Issuer to obtain the benefits of those treaties.,p,
"Investors should note that other action points which form part of the OECD BEPS project (such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for financing costs (see EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti- Tax Avoidance Directive 2)) may be implemented in a manner which affects the tax position of the Issuer.",p,
2.17 EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2,p,
"As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was to be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law. Amongst the measures contained in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. Ireland previously notified the Commission that it intended to derogate from the interest limitation rules meaning the provisions of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on interest deductibility may be deferred in the case of Ireland until potentially 1 January 2024. However, the Department of Finance in its “Corporate Tax – Tax Strategy Group 20/03” paper dated September 2020 has indicated its intention to include final legislation dealing with the interest limitation rule in Finance Bill 2021, to take effect from 1 January 2022. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent. of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under Collateral Obligations (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The European Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. On 21 February 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union agreed an amendment to the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to provide for minimum standards for counteracting hybrid mismatches involving EU Member States and third countries (“Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2”). Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 requires EU Member States to either deny (or, in some circumstances, delay) deduction of payments, expenses or losses or include payments as taxable income, in case of hybrid mismatches. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 applies as of 1 January 2020, except for the provision on reverse hybrid mismatches for which implementation can be postponed to 31 December 2021, and will apply as of 1 January 2022. In accordance with ATAD 2 Ireland has introduced hybrid mismatch rules. These rules are designed to",p,
"neutralise cross border arrangements where amounts are deductible from the income of one entity but are not taxable for another, or the same amounts are deductible for two entities. These rules could potentially apply to the Issuer where, for example: (i) the interest that it pays under the Notes, and claims deductions for, is not brought into account as taxable income by the relevant Noteholder, either because of the characterisation of the Notes, or the payments made under them, or because of the nature of the Noteholder itself; and (ii) the mismatch arises between associated enterprises, between the Issuer and an associated enterprise or under a structured arrangement.",p,
"It is not clear if the Issuer would have any associated enterprise; however, if the Issuer has or had at any time an associated enterprise, unless there is a hybrid mismatch, then the measures should not impact payments on the Notes.",p,
"For the purposes of the hybrid rules, a structured arrangement is one involving a mismatch outcome where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or the arrangement was designed to give rise to a mismatch outcome. Absent any guidance from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on how they will approach structured arrangements, it is not yet clear whether there is any potential for the hybrid rules to apply to the Notes.",p,
2.18 Taxation Implications of Contributions,p,
"A Subordinated Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash by way of a contribution in accordance with Condition 3(e)(i) (Reinvestment Amounts). Subordinated Noteholders may become subject to taxation in relation to the making of a contribution. Subordinated Noteholders are responsible for any and all taxation liabilities that may be applicable in such circumstances. Subordinated Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax treatment to them of making a contribution in accordance with Condition 3(e)(i) (Reinvestment Amounts).",p,
2.19 Diverted Profits Tax,p,
"The Finance Act 2015 introduced a relatively new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent. of any “taxable diverted profits”. The tax has had effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident company’s trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.",p,
"The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the investment manager exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non-UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company. Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to diverted profits tax, it will in certain circumstances be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the Interest Proceeds Priorities of Payment, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that H.M. Revenue & Customs would be entitled to seek to assess the Issuer to any diverted profits tax due directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK tax representative. Should the Issuer be assessed directly on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay such amounts in accordance with the Interest Priorities of Payment, the Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. If United Kingdom diverted profits tax were to be imposed upon the Issuer, then in certain circumstances the Notes may be redeemed (in whole but not in part) at the option of each of either (i) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders in each case acting by Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) the Collateral Manager. See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following a Note Tax Event).",p,
2.20 Imposition of unanticipated Taxes on Issuer / Irish Value Added Tax Treatment of the Collateral Management Fees,p,
"The Issuer has been advised that under current Irish domestic law, the Collateral Management Fees should be exempt from VAT. This is on the basis that they should be treated as consideration paid for collective portfolio management services provided to a “qualifying company” as defined in section 110 of the TCA.",p,
"This exemption is based upon Article 135(1)(g) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the Common System of Value Added Tax (the “VAT Directive”), which provides that EU member states shall exempt from VAT the management of “special investment funds” as defined by EU member states.",p,
"Historically, a similar position has been taken by the Netherlands. However, recent developments have changed this and, in February 2020, the Dutch tax authorities issued letters to participants in the Dutch CLO market explaining that collateral management and administration services are subject to VAT in the Netherlands with effect from 1 April 2019. This change in approach stems in part from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 9 December 2015 in the case of Staatssecretaris van Financiën v Fiscale Eenheid X NV cs Case C-595/13. The Fiscale Eenheid X case concerned whether a Dutch fund investing in real estate could qualify as a “special investment fund”. The Court decided that funds such as those under consideration that are not UCITS could only qualify as “special investment funds” if they are “subject to specific State supervision” because only “investment funds that are subject to specific State supervision can be subject to the same conditions of competition and appeal to the same circle of investors” as UCITS. However, on 22 April 2020, the Dutch tax authorities subsequently provided written guidance confirming that, although collateral management and administration fees remain subject to VAT, this will not apply with retroactive effect.",p,
"Partly in response to the Fiscale Eenheid X case, the European Commission has asked an advisory body (the “VAT Committee”) (comprising representatives from tax authorities of all of the Member States and chaired by a representative from the European Commission) to shed light on the types of entities that can also qualify as “special investment funds”. A large majority of the VAT Committee concluded that an entity cannot qualify as a “special investment fund” if it cannot be seen to target the same circle of investors as UCITS either because of the characteristics of its investment portfolio or because of the conditions under which investors are permitted to participate in the fund.",p,
"The views expressed by the VAT Committee are merely advisory and do not necessarily have the agreement of the European Commission. Furthermore, its views are not legally binding and the courts may disagree with them. There is nevertheless a risk that the European Commission will accept the views of the VAT Committee and will conclude that entities such as the Issuer cannot qualify as a “special investment funds” because they are either not subject to the right sort of regulatory supervision in Ireland and/or because they do not target the same circle of investors as UCITS.",p,
Member States have a degree of discretion on how to define “special investment funds” and therefore there are some discrepancies amongst Member States on the meaning of the term. The Fiscale Eenheid X case was about how broad that discretion is. The application of the VAT exemption for “special investment funds” could now be reviewed at a Member State level and/or by the European Commission to ensure that the definitions used are within the ambit of discretion permitted by the VAT Directive.,p,
"The Issuer is not aware of any proposal to amend Irish domestic law to remove the exemption from VAT on collateral management fees paid by entities such as the Issuer. However, it is possible that some Member States (including Ireland) could change their domestic VAT laws, or the European Commission could require them to do so. If so, the Issuer could from then be required to account for VAT in Ireland in respect of the Collateral Management Fees. The standard VAT rate in Ireland is currently 23%. It is also possible that Ireland could be required to recover the benefit of the VAT exemption obtained before the date on which the law changes from the Issuer together with interest.",p,
"The imposition of VAT in Ireland on the Collateral Management Fees will not constitute a Note Tax Event or a Collateral Tax Event. Accordingly, Noteholders will not become entitled to redeem the Notes in accordance with Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) or Condition 7(b)(iii) (Optional Redemption upon the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event) as a consequence thereof. Furthermore, it may not be possible to substitute the Issuer with another company that is incorporated in",p,
another jurisdiction within the European Economic Area that does not charge VAT on CLO collateral management fees.,p,
2.21 The Common Reporting Standard,p,
"The common reporting standard framework was first released by the OECD in February 2014 as a result of the G20 members endorsing a global model of automatic exchange of information in order to increase international tax transparency. On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”). The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local reporting financial institutions (as defined) (“FIs”) relating to account holders who are tax resident in other participating jurisdictions.",p,
Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implements the CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis.,p,
"Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS. Sections 891F and 891G of the TCA contain measures necessary to implement the CRS internationally and across the European Union, respectively. The Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 of Ireland (the “Regulations”) gave effect to the CRS and the Mandatory Automatic Exchange of Information in the Field of Taxation Regulations 2015 gave effect to DAC II from 1 January 2016.",p,
"The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations to implement the requirements of the CRS and DAC II into Irish law under which Irish FIs (such as the Issuer) will be obliged to make a single return in respect of CRS and DAC II. For the purposes of complying with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, an Irish FI (such as the Issuer) shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence in order to satisfy any reporting requirements which the Issuer may have as a result of CRS and DAC II and Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) or any other person to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will exchange the information with the tax authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. Failure by an Irish FI to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in the Issuer being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed on a non-compliant FI under Irish legislation.",p,
"The Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree that information (including the identity of any Noteholder) supplied for the purposes of CRS and DAC II compliance is intended for the Issuer’s (or any nominated service provider’s) use for the purposes of satisfying CRS and DAC II requirements and the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) will agree, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will take reasonable steps to treat such information in a confidential manner, except that the Issuer may disclose such information (i) to its officers, directors, agents and advisors, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with tax matters, including achieving CRS and DAC II compliance,",p,
"(iii) to any person with the consent of the applicable Noteholder, or (iv) as otherwise required by law or court order or on the advice of its advisors. Further information in relation to CRS can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information webpage on www.revenue.ie.",p,
2.22 Regulated Banking Activity,p,
"While non-bank lending is currently being promoted within the EU, in many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions particularly via the original extension of credit granting a loan and in some cases including purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Regulated Banking Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws (or the AIFMD, in the case of European long-term investment funds).",p,
"Although a number of jurisdictions have consulted and published guidance on non-bank lending, in many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Regulated Banking Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"Collateral Obligations subject to these local law requirements may restrict the Issuer’s ability to purchase the relevant Collateral Obligation or may require it to obtain exposure via a Participation. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency, or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
2.23 EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,p,
"The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) (collectively with secondary and implementing EU rules, and national implementing legislation, the “BRRD”) equips national authorities in Member States (the “Resolution Authorities”) with tools and powers for preparatory and preventive measures, early supervisory intervention and resolution of credit institutions and significant investment firms (collectively, “relevant institutions”). If a relevant institution enters into an arrangement with the Issuer and is deemed likely to fail in the circumstances identified in the BRRD, the relevant Resolution Authority may employ such tools and powers in order to intervene in the relevant institution’s failure (including in the case of derivatives transactions, powers to close-out such transactions or suspend any rights to close-out such transactions). In particular, liabilities of relevant institutions arising out of the Transaction Documents or Underlying Instruments (for example, liabilities arising under Participations or provisions in Underlying Instruments requiring lenders to share amounts) not otherwise subject to an exception, could be subject to the exercise of “bail-in” powers of the relevant Resolution Authorities. It should be noted that certain secured liabilities of relevant institutions are excepted. If the relevant Resolution Authority decides to “bail-in” the liabilities of a relevant institution, then subject to certain exceptions set out in the BRRD, the liabilities of such relevant institution could, among other things, be reduced, converted or extinguished in full. As a result, the Issuer and ultimately, the Noteholders may not be able to recover any liabilities owed by such an entity to the Issuer. In addition, a relevant Resolution Authority may exercise its discretions in a manner that produces different outcomes amongst institutions resolved in different EU Member States. It should also be noted that similar powers and provisions are being considered in the context of financial institutions of other jurisdictions.",p,
"The European Commission adopted a set of draft regulatory technical standards in respect of the valuation of derivatives for the purposes of the BRRD on 23 May 2016. They were published in the Official Journal on 8 July 2016 and entered into force on 28 July 2016 and provide, among other things, that the relevant Resolution Authorities will have the power to terminate swap agreements (as part of the bail-in process) and to value the position thereunder. This will therefore limit any control the Issuer or the Trustee may have in respect of the valuation process, which may be detrimental to the Issuer and consequently, the Noteholders.",p,
"Resolution Authorities also have the right to amend certain agreements, under applicable laws, regulations and guidance (“Stay Regulations”), to ensure stays or overrides of certain termination rights. Such special resolution regimes (“SRRs”) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including differences in their respective implementation dates. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) has implemented rules (Appendix 1 to the PRA’s policy statement 25/15) which requires relevant institutions to ensure that the discretion of the PRA to temporarily suspend termination and security interests under the relevant SRR is respected by counterparties. Any applicable Stay Regulations may result in the Issuer not being able to immediately enforce liabilities owed by relevant institutions that are subject to “stays” under SRRs.",p,
"The resolution mechanisms under the BRRD correspond closely to those available to the Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”) and the European Commission under the single resolution mechanism provided for in Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the “SRM Regulation”). The SRM Regulation applies to participating Member States (including Member States outside the Euro zone that voluntarily participate through a close co-operation agreement). In such jurisdictions, the SRB will take on many of the functions that would otherwise be assigned to national Resolution Authorities by the BRRD. If a Member State outside the Euro zone has chosen not to participate in the bank single supervisory mechanism, relevant institutions established in such Member State will not be subject to the SRM Regulation, but to the application of the BRRD by the Resolution Authorities. It is possible, on the specific facts of a case, that resolution plans and resolution decisions made by the SRB may differ from the resolution schemes that would have been applied by the Resolution Authorities. Therefore, the way in which a relevant institution is resolved and ultimately, the effect of any such resolution on the Issuer and the Noteholders may vary depending on the authority applying the resolution framework.",p,
2.24 Centre of Main Interests,p,
"The Issuer has its registered office in Ireland. Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), the Issuer’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the Issuer did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.",p,
"As the Issuer’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute “proof to the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties” would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.",p,
"As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has retained an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut the presumption that its COMI is located in Ireland, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision. If the Issuer’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.",p,
2.25 Central Securities Depositories Regulation,p,
"Regulation (EU) No. 909/2014 of 23 July 2014 (the “CSDR”) requires that, amongst other things, from 1 January 2025 any EU issuer that issues transferable securities which are admitted to trading on a trading venue, multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility must arrange for such securities to be represented in book-entry form. The Global Exchange Market is a multilateral trading facility for this purpose, and it is therefore expected that the Issuer will be required to comply with the CSDR in respect of the Notes. Accordingly, if any Notes are represented by Definitive Certificates, the Issuer will be required to take action prior to 1 January 2025 to exchange such Definitive Certificates for interests in a Global Certificate, and in connection with which any holders of Definitive Certificates would be required to accept interests in a Global Certificate in exchange for their Definitive Certificates (and in particular, any Class E Noteholders, Class F Noteholders, Class Z Noteholders or Subordinated Noteholders who acquire and hold Definitive Certificates on or following the Issue Date in accordance with the terms hereof, will be so required to exchange their Definitive Certificates for interests in Global Certificates). There is no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to successfully implement such an exchange in all cases",p,
"in order to comply with the CSDR and, any failure to so comply could result in the Issuer (or other transaction parties) becoming subject to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on Noteholders.",p,
3. RELATING TO THE NOTES,p,
3.1 Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer,p,
"Neither the Sole Arranger nor the Initial Purchaser (or any of their affiliates) is under any obligation to make a market for the Notes. The Notes are illiquid investments. Any indicative prices provided by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be determined in the Initial Purchaser’s sole discretion taking into account prevailing market conditions and shall not be a representation by the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates that any instrument can be purchased or sold at such prices (or at all). Notwithstanding the above, the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates may suspend or terminate making a market and/or providing indicative prices without notice, at any time and for any reason. There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of such Notes or that any available sale price will be at par. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the Maturity Date. In addition, no sale, assignment, participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer or any of their officers or Directors (as the case may be) to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.",p,
"In addition, CM Non-Voting Notes may not be exchanged at any time into CM Voting Notes or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes and there are restrictions as to the circumstances in which CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged for CM Voting Notes. Such restrictions on exchange may limit the liquidity of the CM Non-Voting Notes and the CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes.",p,
3.2 Optional Redemption and Market Volatility,p,
"The market value of the Collateral Obligations may fluctuate, with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, foreign exchange rates, general economic conditions, the conditions of financial markets (particularly the markets for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds), European and international political events, events in the home countries of the issuers of the Collateral Obligations or the countries in which their assets and operations are based, developments or trends in any particular industry and the financial condition of such issuers. The secondary market for senior and mezzanine loans and high yield bonds is still limited. A decrease in the market value of the Portfolio would adversely affect the amount of proceeds which could be realised upon liquidation of the Portfolio and ultimately the ability of the Issuer to redeem the Notes.",p,
"A form of liquidity for the Subordinated Notes is the optional redemption provision set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption). There can be no assurance, however, that such optional redemption provision will be capable of being exercised in accordance with the conditions set out in Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption) which may, in some cases, require a determination that the amount realisable from the Portfolio in such circumstances is greater than the aggregate of all amounts which would be due and payable on redemption of the Rated Notes and to the other creditors of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 11(b) (Enforcement) which rank in priority to payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and certain other amounts.",p,
3.3 The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption in whole or in part by Class.,p,
"The Rated Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part from Sale Proceeds and/or Refinancing Proceeds and, in the case of a partial redemption, Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds:",p,
"(a) in the case of a redemption in whole on any Business Day falling on or after the expiry of the Non-Call Period (x) by way of a Refinancing, at the option of (i) the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) subject to the consent of the Collateral Manager or (ii) the Collateral Manager, subject to the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (which may be by Written Resolution)), and (y) solely through the liquidation or realisation of the Portfolio, at the option of (i) the holders of the Subordinated Notes (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or (ii) the Collateral Manager, subject to the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution (which may be by Written Resolution)) in each case (in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption)), subject to and in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed;",p,

"(c) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Note Tax Event at the direction of (i) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) the Collateral Manager; or",p,
"(d) on any Business Day following the occurrence of a Collateral Tax Event in whole (with respect to all Classes of Rated Notes) at the option of (i) the Subordinated Noteholders acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) the Collateral Manager,",p,
"in each case subject to certain requirements and conditions set out in the Conditions (including, where such Optional Redemption is effected through Refinancing, the consent of the Collateral Manager). See Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Investors should carefully review the circumstances and requirements set out in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase).",p,
"In addition, the Rated Notes of any Class may be redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable Redemption Prices, from Refinancing Proceeds and, in the case of a partial redemption, Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds (in accordance with Condition 7(b)(vii) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing)) on any Business Day falling on or after expiry of the Non-Call Period (A) at the direction of both the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) and the Collateral Manager, or (B) at the written direction of the Collateral Manager, subject to the consent of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution), to redeem such Class of Rated Notes. No such Optional Redemption may occur unless the Rated Notes to be redeemed represent the entire Class of such Rated Notes. See Condition 7(b) (Optional Redemption).",p,
"Following the expiry of the Non-Call Period, the Issuer shall redeem the Rated Notes in whole from Sale Proceeds on any Business Day, if the Collateral Principal Amount is less than 20 per cent. of the Target Par Amount and such redemption is directed in writing by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed.",p,
"Prior to any Optional Redemption, the Issuer shall procure that at least 15 (or such shorter period of time as may be agreed between the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Collateral Administrator) days’ prior to the scheduled Redemption Date, written notice is given to the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, each Hedge Counterparty and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).",p,
"As described in Condition 7(b)(vii) (Optional Redemption effected in whole or in part through Refinancing), Refinancing Proceeds may be used in connection with either a redemption in whole of the",p,
"Rated Notes or a redemption in part of the Rated Notes by Class. In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in whole but not in part, such Refinancing will only be effective if (among other things) the Refinancing Proceeds, all Sale Proceeds from the sale of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments received in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Trust Deed, and all other available funds will be at least sufficient to pay all accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses and Trustee Fees and Expenses and all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes (including without limitation Deferred Interest on any Class of Notes entitled thereto) save for the Subordinated Notes and all amounts payable in priority thereto (subject to any election to receive less than 100 per cent. of Redemption Price) on such Redemption Date when applied in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments.",p,
"In the case of a Refinancing upon a redemption of the Rated Notes in part by Class, such Refinancing will only be effective if certain conditions are satisfied including but not limited to: (i) receipt of consent from the Collateral Manager; (ii) any redemption of a Class of Notes is a redemption of the entire Class which is subject to the redemption; and (iii) the sum of (A) the Refinancing Proceeds and (B) the Partial Redemption Interest Proceeds, will be at least sufficient to pay in full (x) the aggregate Redemption Prices of the entire Class or Classes of Rated Notes subject to the Optional Redemption; plus (y) all Trustee Fees and Expenses and all Administrative Expenses (in the order of priority set out in the definition thereof), each to the extent incurred in connection with such Refinancing.",p,
"As described in Condition 7(b)(viii) (Optional Redemption effected through Regulatory Refinancing), the Issuer may, on any Business Day (including any time prior to the Non-Call Period) at the written direction of the Collateral Manager, in order for the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder and/or any “sponsor” or “originator” (or analogous party) of the Issuer (in each case, as applicable) to comply with the EU Retention Requirements and/or the U.S. Retention Regulations (if applicable) and provided that certain conditions are met (as further described in Condition 7(b)(viii) (Optional Redemption effected through Regulatory Refinancing), redeem in part on a pro rata basis the Specified Percentage of each Class of Notes. Investors should note that such Regulatory Refinancing may result in their voting rights being diluted.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that the holders of the Subordinated Notes will not have any cause of action against any of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator or the Trustee for any failure to obtain a Refinancing. If a Refinancing meeting the requirements of the Trust Deed is entered into, the Issuer and, at the direction of the Collateral Manager, the Trustee shall amend the Trust Deed if the Issuer certifies to the Trustee (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without enquiry or liability) that such amendment is in order to facilitate such Refinancing or is necessary to reflect the terms of the Refinancing (including any modification to remove the rights of the Subordinated Noteholders or any other party to direct the Issuer to redeem the Refinancing Obligations issued in respect thereof by way of a further Refinancing) and no consent for such amendments shall be required from the holders of the Notes other than the holders of the Subordinated Notes acting by way of Ordinary Resolution. No assurance can be given that any such amendments to the Trust Deed or the terms of any Refinancing will not adversely affect the holders of any Class or Classes of Notes not subject to redemption (or, in the case of the Subordinated Notes, the holders of the Subordinated Notes who do not direct such redemption).",p,
"The Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed at their Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, on any Business Day on or after the redemption or repayment in full of the Rated Notes, at the direction of either of (x) the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of Ordinary Resolution) or (y) the Collateral Manager.",p,
"In the event of an early redemption, the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date. Where the Notes are to be redeemed by liquidation, there can be no assurance that the Sale Proceeds realised and other available funds would permit any distribution on the Subordinated Notes after all required payments are made to the holders of the Rated Notes. In addition, an Optional Redemption could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realised value of the Collateral Obligations sold.",p,
"Where the Rated Notes are redeemable at the discretion of a transaction party or a particular Class of Noteholders, there is no obligation to consider the interests of any other party or Class of Noteholders when exercising such discretion. Noteholders of a Class of Rated Notes that are redeemed through a Refinancing in whole should be aware that the Applicable Margin of any new notes will be equal to or lower than the Applicable Margin of such Rated Notes immediately prior to such Refinancing.",p,
3.4 The Notes are subject to Special Redemption at the option of the Collateral Manager,p,
"The Notes will be subject to redemption in part by the Issuer on any Payment Date during the Reinvestment Period if the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion provides written certification to the Trustee (on which the Trustee may rely without enquiry or liability) that it (A) has been unable, for a period of at least 20 consecutive Business Days using commercially reasonable endeavours, to identify additional Collateral Obligations or Substitute Collateral Obligations that are deemed appropriate by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion and which would meet the Eligibility Criteria and where acquisition by the Issuer would be in compliance with, to the extent applicable, the Reinvestment Criteria in sufficient amounts to permit the investment or reinvestment of all or a portion of the funds then in the Principal Account to be invested in additional or Substitute Collateral Obligations or (B) at any time after the Effective Date, has determined, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, that a redemption is required in order to avoid a Rating Event. On the Special Redemption Date, the Special Redemption Amount will be applied in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The application of funds in that manner could result in an elimination, deferral or reduction of amounts available to make payments with respect to the Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.5 Mandatory Redemption of the Notes,p,
"Certain mandatory redemption arrangements may result in an elimination, deferral or reduction in the interest payments or principal repayments made to the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders and the Class Z Noteholders or the level of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders, including in relation to mandatory redemption following the breach of any of the Coverage Tests. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,
3.6 The Reinvestment Period may terminate early,p,
"The Reinvestment Period may terminate early if any of the following occur: (a) acceleration following a Note Event of Default or (b) the Collateral Manager certifies to the Issuer, the Rating Agencies and the Trustee that it is unable to reinvest in additional Collateral Obligations in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Early termination of the Reinvestment Period could adversely affect returns to the Subordinated Noteholders and may also cause the holders of Rated Notes to receive principal payments earlier than anticipated.",p,
3.7 The Collateral Manager may reinvest after the end of the Reinvestment Period,p,
"After the end of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may continue to reinvest Unscheduled Principal Proceeds received in respect of Collateral Obligations and the Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Reinvestment of Unscheduled Principal Proceeds and Sale Proceeds from the sale of Credit Risk Obligations and Credit Improved Obligations will likely have the effect of extending the Weighted Average Life of the Collateral Obligations and the average lives of the Notes.",p,
"3.8 Certain Actions May Prevent the Failure of Coverage Tests and/or a Note Event of Default Investors should note that, pursuant to the Transaction Documents:",p,
(a) Additional issuances,p,
"At any time, subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may issue and sell additional Notes and use the net proceeds to acquire Collateral Obligations and, if applicable, enter into additional Hedge Transactions in connection with the Issuer’s issuance of, and making payments on, the Notes",p,
and ownership of and disposition of the Collateral Obligations or (in the case of the proceeds of a further issuance of Subordinated Notes) deposit the net proceeds into the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied for the purposes of a Permitted Use (see Condition 17 (Additional Issuances)).,p,
(b) Redirection of funds,p,
"The Collateral Manager may, pursuant to the Priorities of Payment, redirect funds, including by deferring or waiving payment of some or all of its Collateral Management Fees that would otherwise have been payable to it to be applied towards the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations, Loss Mitigation Loans or other Permitted Uses or designated as a Supplemental Reserve Amount.",p,
"A Class Z Noteholder may, in certain circumstances, provide the Issuer with cash or designate an amount that would otherwise have been due to it under the Priorities of Payments, to be applied toward the acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations or other Permitted Uses.",p,
(c) Collateral Manager Advances,p,
The Collateral Manager may make Collateral Manager Advances (as defined herein) pursuant to Condition 3(m) (Collateral Manager Advances) from time to time prior to the expiry of the Reinvestment Period to the extent there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised or for any other Permitted Use. Outstanding Collateral Manager Advances may accrue interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 2.0 per cent. per annum.,p,
(d) Reinvestment Amounts,p,
"The Subordinated Noteholders may provide the Issuer with a cash advance at any time or may elect to designate some or all of the Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds otherwise due to them in accordance with the Priorities of Payments at any time provided that the procedures of the clearing systems can facilitate such designation) by way of a Reinvestment Amount. The Collateral Manager will decide (in its sole discretion) whether such Reinvestment Amount is accepted and, if so accepted, the Permitted Use to which such Reinvestment Amount shall be applied.",p,
The Collateral Manager may also designate all or a portion of any Incentive Collateral Management Fee as a Reinvestment Amount pursuant to the Priorities of Payments.,p,
"Any of the above actions could result in satisfaction of a Coverage Test that would otherwise be failing and therefore potentially decrease the occurrence of principal prepayments of the highest ranking Class of Notes. Likewise, any such action could prevent a Note Event of Default which would otherwise have occurred and therefore potentially result in the Notes continuing to be outstanding in circumstances where the Controlling Class may otherwise have had the right to direct the Trustee to accelerate the Notes. Consequentially, the average life of the Notes may be longer than it would otherwise be (see 3.17 (“Average Life and Prepayment Considerations”) below).",p,
3.9 Additional Issuances of Notes may Result in the Dilution of Existing Noteholders,p,
"The issuance and sale of additional Notes in accordance with Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) requires that existing Noteholders shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase additional Notes of the relevant Class in an amount not to exceed the percentage of the relevant Class of Notes each holder held immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Notes. To the extent that an existing Noteholder determines not to purchase such additional Notes, or purchases only a portion of its entitlement thereof, the proportion of the Notes held by such holder may be diluted following such additional issuance.",p,
3.10 Limited Recourse Obligations,p,
"The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and are payable solely from amounts received in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to and following enforcement of the security over the Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer and to payment of principal and interest on prior ranking Classes of Notes. See Condition 4(c) (Limited Recourse and Non-Petition). None of the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Noteholders of any Class, the Corporate Services Provider, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Retention Holder, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s Affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes of any Class. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes for the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the distributions on the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on any Class of Notes after making payments on more senior Classes of Notes and certain other required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with such Class pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Retention Holder, any Agent, any Hedge Counterparty, the Corporate Services Provider or any Affiliates of any of the foregoing) will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realisation of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) by (a) firstly, the Subordinated Noteholders; (b) secondly, the Class Z Noteholders; (c) thirdly, the Class F Noteholders; (d) fourthly, the Class E Noteholders;",p,
"(e) fifthly, the Class D Noteholders; (f) sixthly, the Class C Noteholders; (g) seventhly, the Class B Noteholders; and (h) lastly, the Class A Noteholders, in each case in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"In addition, at any time while the Notes are Outstanding, none of the Noteholders nor the Trustee nor any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to institute against the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, or join in any institution against the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary of any examinership, bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement, insolvency, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary which is initiated by another party (which is not an Affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration as to the obligations of the Issuer nor shall any of them have a claim arising in respect of the share capital of the Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary.",p,
3.11 Failure of a Court to Enforce Non-Petition Obligations will Adversely Affect Noteholders,p,
"Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non-petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under applicable bankruptcy laws, and a winding-up (or similar) petition was presented in respect of the Issuer, then the presentation of such a petition could (subject to certain Conditions) result in one or more payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be preferential transfers subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.",p,
3.12 Subordination of the Notes,p,
"Except as described below, the Class B Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class C Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the Class D Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, the Class E Notes are fully",p,
"subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes, the Class F Notes are fully subordinated to the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes, the Class Z Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes, and the Subordinated Notes are fully subordinated to the Rated Notes and the Class Z Notes.",p,
"The payment of principal and interest on any other Classes of Notes may not be made until all payments of principal and interest due and payable on any Classes of Notes ranking in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment have been made in full, subject to and as more fully described in the Priorities of Payment. Payments on the Subordinated Notes will be made by the Issuer to the extent of available funds and no payments thereon will be made until the payment of certain fees and expenses have been made and until interest on the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the relevant Class Z Noteholder Amount has been paid and, subject always to the right of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer to transfer amounts which would have been payable on the Subordinated Notes to the Supplemental Reserve Account to be applied in the acquisition of Substitute Collateral Obligations or in the acquisition or exercise of rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and the requirement to transfer amounts to the Principal Account (or to repay principal on the Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence) in the event that the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test is not met during the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"Non-payment of any Interest Amounts due and payable in respect of the Class A Notes or the Class B Notes on any Payment Date will constitute a Note Event of Default (where such non-payment continues for a period of at least five Business Days or ten Business Days in the case of an administrative error or omission after the Issuer, the Collateral Administrator or the Principal Paying Agent receives written notice of or has actual knowledge of such error or omission). In such circumstances, the Class A Noteholders (or following redemption in full of the Class A Notes, the Class B Noteholders), acting by Extraordinary Resolution, may request the Trustee to accelerate the Notes pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default). However, non-payment of any Interest Amount due and payable in respect of the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes or the Subordinated Notes on any Payment Date will not constitute a Note Event of Default, even if such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class.",p,
"In the event of any acceleration of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes will also be subject to automatic redemption and/or acceleration and the Collateral will, in each case, be liquidated. Liquidation of the Collateral at such time or remedies pursued by the Trustee upon enforcement of the security over the Collateral could be adverse to the interests of the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders or the Subordinated Noteholders, as the case may be. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the Issuer in respect of any Collateral, such losses will be borne first by the Subordinated Noteholders, then by the Class Z Noteholders, then by the Class F Noteholders, then by the Class E Noteholders, then by the Class D Noteholders, then by the Class C Noteholders, then by the Class B Noteholders, and, finally, by the Class A Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class A Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class B Noteholders, the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class B Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class C Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class D Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class E Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class F Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class F Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders. Remedies pursued on behalf of the Class Z Noteholders could be adverse to the interests of the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that in the event of any conflict of interest among or between the Class A Noteholders, the Class B Noteholders (comprising the holders of the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes), the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders, the interests of the Controlling Class will prevail. If the holders of the Controlling Class do not have an interest in the outcome of the conflict, the Trustee shall give priority to the interests of: (i) the Class B Noteholders over the Class C Noteholders, the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (ii) the Class C Noteholders over the Class D Noteholders, the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iii) the Class D Noteholders over the Class E Noteholders, the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (iv) the Class E Noteholders over the Class F Noteholders, the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; (v) the Class F Noteholders over the Class Z Noteholders and the Subordinated Noteholders; and (vi) the Class Z Noteholders over the Subordinated Noteholders. In the event that the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests from two or more groups of holders of the Controlling Class (or another Class is given priority as described in this paragraph), the Trustee shall give priority to the group which holds the greater aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of such Class.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides further that the Trustee will act upon the directions of the holders of the Controlling Class (or other Class given priority as described in this paragraph) in such circumstances, and shall not be obliged to consider the interests of the holders of any other Class of Notes, provided that such action is consistent with the applicable law and with all other provisions of the Trust Deed. See Condition 14(e) (Entitlement of the Trustee and Conflicts of Interest).",p,
3.13 Calculation of Interest,p,
"If the relevant EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i) (Floating Rate of Interest) there can be no guarantee that the Issuer will be able to select four Reference Banks to provide quotations, in order to determine any Rate of Interest in respect of the Floating Rate Notes. Certain financial institutions that have historically acted as Reference Banks have indicated that they will not currently provide quotations and there can be no assurance that they will agree to do so in the future. No Reference Banks have been selected as at the date of this Offering Circular.",p,
"If a EURIBOR screen rate does not appear, or the relevant page is unavailable, and the Issuer is unable to select Reference Banks to provide quotations in the manner described in Condition 6(e)(i)(B) (Floating Rate of Interest), the relevant Rate of Interest in respect of such Payment Date shall be determined, pursuant to Condition 6(e)(i)(C) (Floating Rate of Interest), as the Rate of Interest in effect as at the immediately preceding Accrual Period that was determined by reference to a EURIBOR screen rate or through quotations provided by four Reference Banks provided that, in respect of any Accrual Period during which a Frequency Switch Event occurs, the relevant Rate of Interest shall be calculated using the offered rate for six month Euro deposits using the rate available as at the previous Interest Determination Date. To the extent interest amounts in respect of the Floating Rate Notes are determined by reference to a previously calculated rate, Noteholders may be adversely affected. In such circumstances, neither the Calculation Agent nor the Trustee shall have any obligation to determine the Rate of Interest on any other basis.",p,
3.14 Amount and Timing of Payments,p,
"To the extent that interest payments on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are not made on a relevant Payment Date, such unpaid interest amounts will be deferred and the amount thereof added to the principal amount Outstanding of the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes as the case may be, and earn interest at the interest rate applicable to such Notes. Any failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes or to pay interest and principal on the Class Z Notes or the Subordinated Notes at any time, due to there being insufficient funds available to pay such interest in accordance with the applicable Priorities of Payment, will not be a Note Event of Default. Payments of interest and principal on the Subordinated Notes will only be made to the extent that there are Interest",p,
"Proceeds and Principal Proceeds available for such purpose in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. No interest or principal may therefore be payable on the Subordinated Notes for an unlimited period of time, to maturity or at all.",p,
"A Class Z Noteholder may waive, defer payment or designate for reinvestment its portion of a payment in respect of Class Z Notes. The Class Z Noteholder Amounts may be deferred or waived in full at the election of all of the Class Z Noteholders and, in respect of a partial or full deferral, will not earn interest.",p,
"Investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"As described above, failure to pay scheduled interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes, even where such Class of Notes is the Controlling Class, will not be a Note Event of Default. Holders of such Classes of Notes will consequently have no right to accelerate their Notes or to direct that the Trustee take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral to recover the principal amount of their Notes outstanding in such circumstances.",p,
3.15 Reports Will Not Be Audited,p,
"The Monthly Reports, Effective Date Report, Payment Date Reports, Investor Reports and Loan Reports made available to Noteholders will be compiled by the Collateral Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, in consultation with and based on certain information provided to it by the Collateral Manager. Information in the reports will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm.",p,
3.16 Ratings of the Rated Notes Not Assured and Limited in Scope,p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency at any time. Credit ratings represent a rating agency’s opinion regarding the credit quality of an asset but are not a guarantee of such quality. There is no assurance that a rating accorded to any of the Notes will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a Rating Agency if, in its judgement, circumstances in the future so warrant. In the event that a rating initially assigned to any of the Notes is subsequently lowered for any reason, no person or entity is required to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to any such Notes and the market value of such Notes is likely to be adversely affected.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that, as a result of the recent economic events, Rating Agencies have undertaken extensive reviews of their rating methodology and criteria used to rate notes issued as part of CLO transactions. This could impact on the ratings assigned to the Notes after the Issue Date and potentially result in the downgrade or withdrawal thereof following the Issue Date.",p,
"The Rating Agencies may change their published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the Rated Notes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agencies may retroactively apply any new standards to the ratings of the Rated Notes. Any such action could result in a substantial lowering (or even withdrawal) of any rating assigned to any Rated Note, despite the fact that such Rated Note might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth for such Rated Note in this Offering Circular and the Transaction Documents. The rating assigned to any Rated Note may also be lowered following the occurrence of an event or circumstance despite the fact that the related Rating Agency previously provided confirmation that such occurrence would not result in the rating of such Rated Note being lowered. Additionally, any Rating Agency may, at any time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower or withdraw any rating assigned by it to any Class of Rated Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, holders",p,
of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount. Any reduction or withdrawal to the ratings on any Class of Rated Notes may significantly reduce the liquidity of the Notes and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make certain changes to the composition of the Collateral.,p,
"As at the date of this Offering Circular, each of the Rating Agencies is established in the European Union and is registered under the CRA. As such each Rating Agency is included in the list of credit rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA. ESMA may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies for registration under the CRA and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of the Rated Notes.",p,
Rating Agencies may refuse to give rating agency confirmations,p,
"Historically, many actions by issuers of collateralised loan obligation vehicles (including but not limited to issuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be reduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances under which they are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, regardless of the requirements of the Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents. If the Transaction Documents require that written confirmation from a Rating Agency be obtained before certain actions may be taken and an applicable Rating Agency is unwilling to provide the required confirmation, it may be impossible to effect such action, which could result in losses being realised by the Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of the Notes.",p,
"If a Rating Agency announces or informs the Trustee, the Collateral Manager or the Issuer that confirmation from such Rating Agency is not required for a certain action or that its practice is to not give such confirmations for certain types of actions, the requirement for confirmation from such Rating Agency will not apply. Further, in connection with the Effective Date, if an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, the applicable Rated Notes may be subject to redemption in part in an amount and in the manner described under Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event). There can be no assurance that a Rating Agency will provide such rating confirmations upon request, regardless of the terms agreed to among transaction participants, or not subsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Rated Notes, which could materially adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.",p,
Requirements imposed on Rating Agencies could result in withdrawal of ratings if certain actions are not taken by the Sole Arranger,p,
"On 2 June 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance product (such as this transaction) paid for by the “arranger” (defined as the issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the arranger to (i) create a password protected website,",p,
"(ii) post on that website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the initial rating of any Class of Rated Notes and all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding their use of the information. In this transaction, the arranger is the Issuer.",p,
"Each Rating Agency must be able to reasonably rely on the arranger’s certifications. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its ratings of the Rated Notes. In such case, the withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may adversely affect the price or transferability of the Rated Notes and may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes.",p,
"Under Rule 17g-5, rating agencies providing the requisite certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Rated Notes (“Unsolicited Ratings”) which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings provided by the Rating Agencies. The Unsolicited Ratings may be",p,
"issued prior to, on or after the Issue Date and will not be reflected herein. Issuance of any Unsolicited Rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. A rating agency that has reviewed the transaction may have a fundamentally different methodology or approach to or opinion of the structure or the nature or quality of all or some of the underlying Collateral Obligations which may result in a view or rating which differs significantly from the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies. Issuance of an Unsolicited Rating lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies on the applicable Rated Notes might adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of the Rated Notes as an investment or the capital treatment of the Rated Notes.",p,
The SEC may determine that one or both of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as a nationally recognised statistical rating organisation for purposes of the federal securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market value of the Rated Notes.,p,
Actions of any Rating Agency can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the Notes,p,
"The SEC adopted Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10 to the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on 27 August 2014, which require certain filings or certifications to be made in connection with the performance of “due diligence services” for rated asset-backed securities on or after 15 June 2015. Under Rule 17g-10, a provider of third-party due diligence services must provide to each nationally recognised statistical rating organisation that is rating the applicable transaction, a written certification in a prescribed form (which obligation may be satisfied if the Issuer posts such certification in the required form to the Rule 17g-5 website referred to above, maintained in connection with the transaction). It is presently unclear what, if any, services provided or to be provided by third parties to the Issuer in connection with the transaction described in this Offering Circular, would constitute “due diligence services” under Rule 17g-10, and consequently, no assurance can be given as to whether any certification will be posted by the Issuer or delivered by any applicable third party service provider to the Rating Agencies in circumstances where such certification is deemed to have been required under the rules. If the Issuer or any third party that provides due diligence services to the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under Rule 17g-10, the Rating Agencies may withdraw (or fail to confirm) their ratings of the Notes. In such case, the price or transferability of the Notes (and any beneficial owner of Notes that relies on ratings of securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes) may be adversely affected.",p,
3.17 Average Life and Prepayment Considerations,p,
"The Maturity Date of the Notes is the Payment Date falling on 15 January 2034 or, if such day is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day (unless it would fall in the following month, in which case it shall be moved to the immediately preceding Business Day); however, the principal of the Notes of each Class is expected to be repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date. Average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of delivery of a Note until each Euro of the principal of such Note will be paid to the investor. The average lives of the Notes will be determined by the amount and frequency of principal payments, which are dependent upon, among other things, the amount of payments received at or in advance of the scheduled maturity of the Collateral Obligations (whether through sale, maturity, redemption, default or other liquidation or disposition). The actual average lives and actual maturities of the Notes will be affected by the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral Obligations and the characteristics of such assets, including the existence and frequency of exercise of any optional or mandatory redemption features, the prevailing level of interest rates, the redemption price, the actual default rate, the actual level of recoveries on any Defaulted Obligations and the timing of defaults and recoveries, and the frequency of tender or exchange offers for such Collateral Obligations. Collateral Obligations may be subject to optional prepayment by the Obligor of such loans. Any disposition of a Collateral Obligation may change the composition and characteristics of the remaining Portfolio and the rate of payment thereon and, accordingly, may affect the actual average lives of the Notes. The rate of and timing of future defaults and the amount and timing of any cash realisation from Defaulted Obligations also will affect the maturity and average lives of the Notes.",p,
"Projections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inherently uncertain",p,
"Estimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided to prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward-looking statements. Projections are",p,
"necessarily speculative in nature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialise or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such variations may be material. Some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; market, financial or legal uncertainties; the timing of acquisitions of Collateral Obligations; differences in the actual allocation of Collateral Obligations among asset categories from those assumed; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Proceeds from the Collateral Obligations. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction or any of their respective Affiliates has any obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",p,
3.18 Volatility of the Class Z Notes and Subordinated Notes,p,
"The Subordinated Notes represent a leveraged investment in the underlying Collateral Obligations and the Class Z Notes represent an investment in certain fees which may become due in respect of the transaction. Accordingly, it is expected that changes in the market value of the Subordinated Notes will be greater than changes in the market value of the underlying Collateral Obligations, which themselves are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. Utilisation of leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks to investors and will generally magnify the Subordinated Noteholders’ opportunities for gain and risk of loss. In certain scenarios, the Notes may not be paid in full, and the Subordinated Notes, the Class Z Notes and one or more Classes of Rated Notes may be subject to a partial or a complete loss of invested capital. The Subordinated Notes represent the most junior securities in a leveraged capital structure. As a result, any deterioration in performance of the asset portfolio, including defaults and losses, a reduction of realised yield or other factors, will be borne first by holders of the Subordinated Notes, then the Class Z Notes and then by the holders of the Rated Notes in reverse order of seniority.",p,
"In addition, the failure to meet certain Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test will result in cash flow that may have been otherwise available for distribution to the Subordinated Notes, to pay interest on the Class Z Notes and to pay interest on one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes or for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations being applied on the next Payment Date to make principal payments on the more senior classes of Rated Notes until such Coverage Tests and Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test have been satisfied. This feature will likely reduce the return on the Subordinated Notes, the Class Z Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes and cause temporary or permanent suspension of distributions to the Subordinated Notes, the Class Z Notes and/or one or more subordinate Classes of Rated Notes. See 3.5 (“Mandatory Redemption of the Notes”) above.",p,
"Issuer expenses (including management fees) are generally based on a percentage of the total asset portfolio of the Issuer, including the assets obtained through the use of leverage. Given the leveraged capital structure of the Issuer, expenses attributable to the Subordinated Notes will be higher because such expenses will be based on total assets of the Issuer.",p,
3.19 Net Proceeds less than Aggregate Amount of the Notes,p,
"It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Issuer on the Issue Date from the issuance of the Notes will be less than the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes in full. Consequently, it is anticipated that on the Issue Date the Collateral would be insufficient to redeem the Notes in full upon the occurrence of a Note Event of Default on or about that date.",p,
3.20 Withholding Tax on the Notes,p,
"Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes there can be no assurance that the law will not change. In the event that any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will not be",p,
"entitled to receive grossed-up amounts to compensate for such withholding tax and no Note Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. In addition, as described under Condition 2(j) (Forced Transfer pursuant to FATCA), the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a holder if the holder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA.",p,
"In the event of the occurrence of a Note Tax Event pursuant to which any payment on the Notes of any Class becomes properly subject to any withholding tax or deduction on account of tax (other than in the circumstances set out in the definition thereof), the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of (i) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) the Collateral Manager, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
3.21 Security,p,
"Clearing Systems: Collateral Obligations or other assets forming part of the Collateral which are in the form of securities (if any) will be held by the Custodian on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to the Agency Agreement. The Custodian will hold such assets which can be cleared through Euroclear in an account with Euroclear unless the Trustee otherwise consents and will hold the other securities comprising the Portfolio which cannot be so cleared (i) through its accounts with Clearstream, Luxembourg and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as appropriate, and (ii) through its sub-custodians who will in turn hold such assets which are securities both directly and through any appropriate clearing system. Those assets held in clearing systems will not be held in special purpose accounts and will be fungible with other securities from the same issue held in the same accounts on behalf of the other customers of the Custodian or its sub custodian, as the case may be. A first fixed charge over the Portfolio will be created under English law pursuant to the Trust Deed on the Issue Date which will, in relation to the Collateral Obligations that are held through the Custodian, take effect as a security interest over (i) the beneficial interest of the Issuer in its share of the pool of securities fungible with the relevant Collateral Obligations held in the accounts of the Custodian on account for the Issuer and (ii) the Issuer’s ancillary contractual rights against the Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement (each as defined in the Conditions) which may expose the Secured Parties to the risk of loss in the case of a shortfall of such securities in the event of insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodian.",p,
"In addition, custody and clearance risks may be associated with Collateral Obligations or other assets comprising the Portfolio which are securities that do not clear through The Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”), Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. There is a risk, for example, that such securities could be counterfeit, or subject to a defect in title or claims to ownership by other parties, including custody liens imposed by standard custody terms at various stages in the chain of intermediary ownership of such Collateral Obligations.",p,
"Any risk of loss arising from any insufficiency or ineffectiveness of the security for the Notes or the custody and clearance risks which may be associated with assets comprising the Portfolio will be borne by the Noteholders without recourse to the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian, the Hedge Counterparties or any other party.",p,
"Fixed Security: Although the security constituted by the Trust Deed over the Collateral held from time to time, including the security over the Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge, it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments contemplated by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and the payments to be made from the Accounts in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed) without the consent of the Trustee.",p,
"3.22 Resolutions, Amendments and Waivers",p,
The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of Resolutions by the Noteholders. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.,p,
"Decisions may be taken by Noteholders by way of Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, in each case, either acting together or, to the extent specified in any applicable Transaction Document, as a Class of Noteholders acting independently. Such Resolutions can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the applicable Noteholders or by the applicable Noteholders resolving in writing. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the Issuer, the Trustee (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes of a particular Class, subject to certain conditions including minimum notice periods.",p,
"The Trustee may, in its discretion, determine that any proposed Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution affects only the holders of one or more Classes of Notes, in which event the required quorum and minimum percentage voting requirements of such Ordinary Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution may be determined by reference only to the holders of that Class or Classes of Notes.",p,
"In the event that a meeting of Noteholders is called to consider a Resolution, determination as to whether the requisite number of Notes has been voted in favour of such Resolution will be determined (assuming such meeting is quorate as described below and all Noteholders attending such meeting vote in respect of such Resolution) by reference to the percentage which the Notes voted in favour represent of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all such Notes held or represented by any person or persons entitled to vote and voted at such meeting.",p,
The quorum requirements for Noteholder meetings require one or more persons holding or representing:,p,
"(i) in the case of a Noteholder meeting convened to consider or an Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class not less than 75 per cent.; (ii) in the case of Noteholder meeting convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution not less than 66⅔ per cent.; or (iii) in the case of a Noteholder meeting convened to consider an Ordinary Resolution not less than 50 per cent., in each case of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of all Notes (or the relevant Class or Classes only, if applicable) held or represented by any persons entitled to vote at the relevant meeting, to be present. In addition, in the case of a Noteholder meeting convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class, in the event that such quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, the same quorum requirement will apply at the relevant adjourned meeting. In all other cases, in the event that a quorum requirement is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum as set out in Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution) and in the Trust Deed. There are no quorum requirements for passing a Written Resolution.",p,
"Prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that the quorum requirement for an Extraordinary Resolution of the Controlling Class solely in relation to instructing the Trustee to accelerate the Notes in accordance with Condition 10(b) (Acceleration) and instructing the Trustee to sell the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes, is at least 75 per cent. of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the Controlling Class. This is a higher quorum threshold than in respect of any other Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders.",p,
"The voting threshold at any Noteholders’ meeting in respect of an Ordinary Resolution or an Extraordinary Resolution of all Noteholders is, respectively, more than 50 per cent. or at least 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the Notes voted at the meeting.",p,
"Certain decisions, including the removal of the Collateral Manager, instructing the Trustee to accelerate the Notes and instructing the Trustee to sell the Collateral following the acceleration of the Notes require authorisation solely by the Noteholders of a Class or Classes (acting by Extraordinary Resolution).",p,
"Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes that are in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes will have no right to vote in connection with and will not",p,
be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum or the result of voting on any CM Removal Resolution or any CM Replacement Resolution but shall carry a right to vote on and be counted in respect of all other matters in respect of which the CM Voting Notes have a right to vote and be counted.,p,
"Any Notes (including Rated Notes, Class Z Notes and Subordinated Notes) held by (i) Collateral Manager Related Persons shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Removal Resolution; and (ii) the Collateral Manager shall have no voting rights with respect to, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Replacement Resolution following a CM Removal Resolution.",p,
"Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes in the form of CM Voting Notes may form a small percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) and/or be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should be aware that such CM Voting Notes, together with the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, will be entitled to vote to pass a CM Removal Resolution and a CM Replacement Resolution and the remaining percentage of the Controlling Class (or other relevant Class or Classes) held in the form of CM Non-Voting Notes and/or CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes will be bound by such resolution. Holders of the CM Voting Notes may have interests that differ from other holders of the Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes (in the form of CM Voting Notes) and the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their voting rights. The entire Class of Subordinated Notes may also be held by a concentrated group of Noteholders. Investors should also be aware that such group of Noteholders would in such circumstances exercise effective control over the exercise of rights granted to Subordinated Noteholders as a Class pursuant to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and may have interests that differ from other Noteholders and may seek to profit or seek direct benefits from their effective control over the exercise of such rights.",p,
"Investors in Class A Notes should be aware that for so long as Class A Notes have not been redeemed and paid in full, if no Class A Notes are held in the form of CM Voting Notes, the Class A Notes will not be entitled to vote in respect of such CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution and such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes in accordance with the definition of Controlling Class.",p,
"Similarly, investors in the other Classes of Notes should be aware that if there are no Notes in their Class that would be entitled to vote and be counted in respect of a CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution such right shall pass to a more junior Class of Notes.",p,
"Certain amendments and modifications may be made without the consent of Noteholders. See Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver). Such amendment or modification could be adverse to certain Noteholders. Without limitation to the foregoing, potential investors should note that the Issuer may amend the Transaction Documents to modify or amend the components of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Eligibility Criteria, the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, the Reinvestment Criteria, the Collateral Quality Tests and the related definitions, provided that Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained and (to the extent provided in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver)) the Controlling Class has consented by way of Ordinary Resolution.",p,
"Certain entrenched rights relating to the Conditions including the currency thereof, Payment Dates applicable thereto, the Priorities of Payment, the provisions relating to quorums and the percentages of votes required for the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution cannot be amended or waived by Ordinary Resolution but require an Extraordinary Resolution. It should however be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the provisions of the Trust Deed will be binding on all such dissenting Noteholders.",p,
"In addition to the Trustee’s right to agree to changes to the Transaction Documents to correct a manifest error, or to changes which, in its opinion, are not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders of any Class without the consent of the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be obliged to consent to",p,
"modifications and waivers granted in respect of certain other matters, subject to prior notice thereof being given to the Trustee without the consent of the Noteholders as set out in Condition 14(c) (Modification and Waiver) but in the event of any amendments to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the consent of the Collateral Manager shall be required.",p,
"Each Hedge Counterparty may also need to be notified and its consent required to the extent provided for in the applicable Hedge Agreement in respect of a modification, amendment or supplement to any provision of the Transaction Documents. The Hedge Agreements may allow a certain period for the relevant Hedge Counterparty to consider and respond to such a consent request. During such period and pending a response from the relevant Hedge Counterparty, the Issuer may not be able to make such modification, amendment or supplement and therefore implementation thereof may be delayed. Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders or in a manner required in order to ensure regulatory compliance.",p,
"In addition, any amendment that is made to the Transaction Documents contemporaneously with a Refinancing in whole (including any such amendment that would otherwise have required an Extraordinary Resolution of the Subordinated Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution)), may be approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Subordinated Noteholders. See Condition 14(b)(viii) (Extraordinary Resolution).",p,
"Investors should also note that for the purposes of determining voting rights attributable to the Notes and the applicable quorum at any meeting of the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 14 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution), the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall be deemed to constitute a single class, in respect of any voting rights specifically granted to them (including as the Controlling Class). As a consequence holders of the Class B-1 Notes and the Class B-2 Notes shall act not separately but together as a single Class for voting purposes, including in relation to amendments where the interests of such Noteholders may not be aligned.",p,
3.23 Concentrated Ownership of One or More Classes of Notes,p,
"If at any time one or more investors that are Affiliates hold a majority of any Class of Notes, it may be more difficult for other investors to take certain actions that require consent of any such Classes of Notes without their consent. For example, optional redemption and the removal of the Collateral Manager for cause and appointment are at the direction of holders of specified percentages of Subordinated Notes and/or the Controlling Class (as applicable).",p,
3.24 Enforcement Rights Following a Note Event of Default,p,
"If a Note Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), at the request of the Controlling Class acting by way of Extraordinary Resolution, give notice to the Issuer and the Collateral Manager that all the Notes are immediately due and repayable, provided that following the occurrence of a Note Event of Default described in Condition 10(a)(vi) (Insolvency Proceedings) of the definition thereof, such notice shall be deemed to have been given and all the Notes shall automatically become immediately due and repayable.",p,
"At any time after the Notes become due and repayable and the security under the Trust Deed becomes enforceable, the Trustee may, at its discretion, and shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), if so directed by the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution, take Enforcement Action (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the security over the Collateral provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken by the Trustee unless: (A) it determines in accordance with Condition 11 (Enforcement) that the anticipated proceeds realised from such Enforcement Action (after deducting any expenses properly incurred in connection therewith), would be sufficient to discharge in full all amounts due and payable in respect of all Classes of Notes other than the Class Z Notes and the Subordinated Notes (including, without limitation, Deferred Interest on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes) and all amounts payable in priority thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment; or otherwise (B) (1) in the case of a Note",p,
"Event of Default specified in Condition 10(a)(i), (ii) or (iv) (Note Events of Default) the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action without regard to any other Note Event of Default which has occurred prior to such Note Event of Default; or (2) in the case of any other Note Event of Default, each Class of Rated Notes (acting independently and each by way of Extraordinary Resolution) directs the Trustee to take Enforcement Action.",p,
"The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests of certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,
3.25 Investment Company Act,p,
"The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exemption under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for investment companies (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.",p,
"If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.",p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines at any time that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder demanding that such Non-Permitted Noteholder transfer its interest to a non U.S. Person in an “offshore transaction” in accordance with Regulation S or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Noteholder within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such Non-Permitted Noteholder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30 day period, (a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB/QP and",p,
"(b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.",p,
3.26 Certain ERISA Considerations,p,
"Under a regulation of the U.S. Department of Labor, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, if certain employee benefit plans or other retirement arrangements subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) or entities whose underlying assets are treated as assets of such plans or arrangements (collectively, “Plans”) invest in a Class of Notes that is treated as equity under the regulation (which could include the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes, the Class Z Notes or the Subordinated Notes), the assets of the Issuer could be considered",p,
to be assets of such Plans and certain of the transactions contemplated under such Notes could be considered “prohibited transactions” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. See the section entitled “Certain ERISA Considerations” below.,p,
3.27 Forced Transfer,p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is both a QIB and a QP. In addition each Noteholder will be deemed or in some cases required to make certain representations in respect of ERISA.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines at any time that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act (a “U.S. Person”) and is not both a QIB and a QP (any such person, a “Non-Permitted Noteholder”) or a Noteholder is a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder, the Issuer shall, promptly after determination that such person is a Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder by the Issuer, send notice to such Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) demanding that such Holder transfer its interest outside of the United States to a non-U.S. Person in an “offshore transaction” in accordance with Regulation S or to a person that is not a Non-Permitted Noteholder or Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder (as applicable) within 30 days (or 10 days in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder) of the date of such notice. If such Holder fails to effect the transfer required within such 30-day period (or 10-day period in the case of a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder), (a) the Issuer or the Collateral Manager on its behalf and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause such beneficial interest to be transferred in a commercially reasonable sale to a person or entity that certifies to the Issuer, in connection with such transfer, that such person or entity either is not a U.S. Person or is a QIB and a QP and is not a Non-Permitted ERISA Noteholder; and (b) pending such transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such beneficial interest.",p,
"In addition, the Trust Deed generally provides that, if a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes (other than the Retention Notes), and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes (other than the Retention Notes) within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.",p,
3.28 U.S. Tax Risks,p,
Changes in tax law; imposition of tax on Non-U.S. Holders,p,
"Distributions on the Notes to a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) that provides appropriate tax certifications to the Issuer and gain recognised on the sale, exchange or retirement of the Notes by the Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the payments or gain are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States or, in the case of gain, the Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual who holds the Notes as a capital asset and is present in the United States for more than 182 days in the taxable year of the sale, and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, no assurance can be given that Non-U.S. Holders will not in the future be subject to tax imposed by the United States.",p,
U.S. trade or business,p,
"Although the Issuer intends to operate so as not to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income, if the Issuer were to breach certain of its covenants and acquire certain assets (for example, a “United States real property interest” or an equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is itself engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S.",p,
"federal income tax purposes), including upon a foreclosure, or breach certain of its other covenants, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, a breach of certain of these covenants may not give rise to a Note Event of Default and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. A change in law or its interpretation also could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis. If it is determined that the Issuer is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Issuer has taxable income that is effectively connected with such",p,
"U.S. trade or business, the Issuer will be subject under the Code to the regular U.S. corporate income tax on its effectively connected taxable income, which may be imposed on a gross basis, and possibly to a 30 per cent. branch profits tax and state and local taxes as well. The imposition of such a tax liability could materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
Additional Notes may not be fungible for tax purposes,p,
"Any additional Notes issued after the Issue Date in accordance with Condition 17 (Additional Issuances) may not be treated as part of the same issue for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the Outstanding Notes of the same Class that were previously issued. As a result, different blocks of Notes could be treated differently for U.S. federal income tax purposes from other blocks of the same Class. If all blocks of a Class of Notes bear the same securities identifier, the Issuer and holders may not be able to distinguish between different blocks of that Class. As a result, information returns furnished to investors may not accurately reflect the amount of OID required to be accrued by them.",p,
FATCA,p,
"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income. Under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and Ireland, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with Irish implementing regulations that require the Issuer to provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, which would then provide this information to the IRS. The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and these regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Moreover, the intergovernmental agreement or the Irish implementing regulations could be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “passthru” payments to holders that fail to provide certain information to the Issuer or are certain “foreign financial institutions” that do not comply with FATCA.",p,
"If a Noteholder fails to provide the Issuer or its agents with any correct, complete and accurate information or documentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA and to prevent the imposition of tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to tax under FATCA, the Issuer is authorised to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholder, to compel the Noteholder to sell its Notes (other than the Retention Notes), and, if the Noteholder does not sell its Notes (other than the Retention Notes) within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell the Noteholder’s Notes on behalf of the Noteholder.",p,
Possible treatment of the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes,p,
"The Class E Notes and Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or the Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of such Notes could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a “protective” qualified electing fund election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes. Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of those Notes could be subject to the rules pertaining to 10 per cent. United States shareholders of CFCs (as defined below). See “Tax",p,
Considerations – Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Rated Notes – Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes”.,p,
U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain,p,
"The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Because of this uncertainty, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in a Note. For a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in a Note, please see the summary under “Tax Considerations — Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” below.",p,
3.29 Class Z Notes,p,
"As further described in the section of this Offering Circular titled “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement — Compensation of the Collateral Manager”, the Senior Management Fees do not include a subordinated fee payable to the Collateral Manager that is senior to the payments on the Subordinated Notes but subordinated to the Rated Notes in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Collateral Manager expects to be one of the holders of the Class Z Notes in connection with which the Class Z Noteholder Amount will be payable subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Such Class Z Notes may be transferred (subject to the restrictions set out in the Conditions and the Trust Deed) and a portion of such Class Z Notes shall be issued on the Issue Date to one or more Subordinated Noteholders. The Collateral Manager’s compensation may therefore be reduced. Further, the U.S. federal income tax characterisation of the Class Z Notes is uncertain. Potential holders of Class Z Notes are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of acquiring, beneficially owning and transferring Class Z Notes.",p,
4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL,p,
4.1 The Portfolio,p,
"The decision by any prospective holder of Notes to invest in such Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests (other than paragraph (m) thereof), Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case (save as described herein) thereafter. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time. Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria.",p,
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds), Unsecured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Unsecured Senior Loans and/or Unsecured Senior Bonds), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.",p,
"In particular, prospective purchasers of the Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the underlying Collateral Obligations. (See “Ratings of the Notes”). If, however, actual payment deficiencies arising from defaults on Collateral Obligations exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. The financial markets periodically experience substantial fluctuations in prices for obligations of the types that may be Collateral Obligations and limited liquidity for such obligations. No assurance can be made that the",p,
"conditions giving rise to such price fluctuations and limited liquidity will not occur, subsist or become more acute following the Issue Date. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the ability of the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire or dispose of a price and time that the Collateral Manager deems advantageous may be impaired. As a result, in periods of rising market prices, the Issuer may be unable to participate in price increases fully to the extent that it is either unable to dispose of Collateral Obligations whose prices have risen or to acquire Collateral Obligations whose prices are on the increase; the Collateral Manager’s inability to dispose fully and promptly of positions in declining markets will conversely cause the value of the Portfolio to decline as the value of unsold positions is marked to lower prices. A decrease in the value of the Collateral Obligations would also adversely affect the proceeds of sale that could be obtained upon the sale of the Collateral Obligations and could ultimately affect the ability of the Issuer to pay in full or redeem the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
4.3 The Warehouse Arrangements,p,
"On behalf of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager has acquired, and will continue to enter into binding commitments to acquire, Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date (the “Warehouse Assets”) pursuant to a financing arrangement (the “Warehouse Arrangements”) between the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser as lender, one or more Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and certain other third parties as subordinated noteholders (such parties, collectively, the “Warehouse Providers”).",p,
"The Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer) has purchased or entered into certain agreements to purchase a substantial portion of the Portfolio on or prior to the Issue Date and will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to settle any outstanding trades on the Issue Date and to repay the Warehouse Providers in respect of the funds provided pursuant to the Warehouse Arrangements which were used to finance the purchase of such Collateral Obligations prior to the Issue Date and all Warehouse Arrangements must be terminated in all respects on the Issue Date, and all amounts owing to the Warehouse Providers in connection with such arrangements must be repaid on or prior to the Issue Date, including from the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
"Some of the Collateral Obligations may have been acquired from the Warehouse Providers. Under the terms of the Warehouse Arrangements, the Collateral Manager has sole responsibility for the selection of Collateral Obligations, although the senior lender has the right to approve or reject any Collateral Obligations that are selected by the Collateral Manager. However, the lenders’ involvement in such process should not be viewed as a determination by the Initial Purchaser or a lender as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether such asset satisfies the portfolio criteria applicable to the Issuer.",p,
"The prices paid for such Collateral Obligations will be the market value thereof on the date the Issuer entered into the commitment to purchase, which may be greater or less than the market value thereof on the Issue Date. Events occurring between the date of the Issuer first acquiring a Collateral Obligation and the Issue Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Collateral Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Issue Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions, international political events and other macroeconomic events, could adversely affect the market value of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”.",p,
"Although Barclays Bank PLC was involved in the Warehouse Arrangements, its involvement in such arrangements, and its approval of the purchase of assets acquired under such arrangements, was solely in its capacity as a Warehouse Provider and should not be viewed as a determination by the Initial Purchaser as to whether a particular asset is an appropriate investment by the Issuer or whether such asset",p,
"satisfies the Eligibility Criteria applicable to the Issuer. The Initial Purchaser's determination to approve the acquisition of such assets was not based on any credit analysis undertaken by, or available to it in relation to such assets, and the Initial Purchaser will not, nor is required to, monitor the value of such assets or the creditworthiness of the Obligor of any such asset.",p,
"In addition, any interest or other amounts paid or accrued on such Collateral Obligations during the period prior to the Issue Date will be paid to the Warehouse Providers on the Issue Date. Investors in the Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in the Collateral Obligations from the date such Collateral Obligations are acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date but will not receive the benefit of interest earned on the Collateral Obligations during such period provided that any risk in relation to any Collateral Obligations which are ineligible collateral as at the Issue Date or which do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date shall be borne by the Warehouse Providers, provided further that any net realised gains and/or losses in respect of the Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date will be for the account of the Warehouse Providers. Certain costs and expenses related to the Warehouse Arrangements, including payment of certain fees and reimbursement of certain expenses to the lenders under the Warehouse Arrangements and any agents appointed in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements, will therefore be borne by the Issuer as such amounts will be paid by application of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes.",p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Warehouse Assets in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies only at the time that any commitment to purchase a Collateral Obligation is entered into, and any failure by such Collateral Obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action (other than in the case of Issue Date Collateral Obligations which must satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as of the Issue Date).",p,
"During the period of the Warehouse Arrangements, the Issuer may have purchased Warehouse Assets directly from the Initial Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and the price at which such Warehouse Assets were purchased by the Issuer may have resulted in the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliate, as the case may be, earning a profit from the sale of such asset. See “Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates” below.",p,
4.4 Loss Mitigation Loans,p,
"The Collateral Manager has the discretion at any time on and after the Issue Date but subject to certain conditions and limitations, to purchase Loss Mitigation Loans from amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account, the Interest Account or the Supplemental Reserve Account. Loss Mitigation Loans shall not be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria at the time the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such obligation, but will only be designated as a Collateral Obligation by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Until their designation as Collateral Obligations and notwithstanding that they may not have satisfied the Eligibility Criteria or the Reinvestment Criteria, such assets may, subject to certain conditions, be given some value in the calculation of the Par Value Tests. In relation to amounts received in respect of such assets, the Collateral Manager may determine their constitution as either Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds, subject to certain conditions. The Collateral Manager can sell such assets at any time. Amounts standing to the credit of the Principal Account, the Interest Account or the Supplemental Reserve Account which may otherwise be used to repay Noteholders can be used by the Collateral Manager to purchase Loss Mitigation Loans in certain circumstances to the extent permitted pursuant to Condition 3(l) (Payments to and from the Accounts). Whilst the discretions of the Collateral Manager to purchase Loss Mitigation Loans may permit the Collateral Manager to more significantly participate in restructuring processes, proceeds which may have otherwise been utilised for the purchase of Collateral Obligations may be used to purchase Loss Mitigation Loans and there is no guarantee that the acquisition of Loss Mitigation Loans",p,
will serve to maintain or improve the value of the related Defaulted Obligations or Credit Risk Obligation held by the Issuer.,p,
"There is no guarantee that a Loss Mitigation Loan will satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at any time and if such Loss Mitigation Loan does satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at any time, the Collateral Manager is not obliged to designate such asset as a Collateral Obligation.",p,
4.5 Acquisitions of Collateral Obligations and purchase price for such acquisitions,p,
"Although the Collateral Manager is required to determine and use reasonable endeavours in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement that obligations satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time of entering into a binding commitment to purchase them, it is possible that such obligations may no longer satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the later settlement of the acquisition thereof due to intervening events and any failure by such obligation to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at a later stage will not result in any requirement to sell it or take any other action.",p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
4.6 Considerations Relating to the Initial Investment Period,p,
"During the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy as at the Effective Date each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests (other than paragraph (m) thereof) and Target Par Amount requirement. See 4.1 (“The Portfolio”). The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. See 1.5 “Events in the CLO and Leveraged Finance Markets”. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend upon a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager, including its ability to identify a suitable Hedge Counterparty. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
"Investors should note that, during the Initial Investment Period, the Collateral Manager may apply some or all amounts standing to the credit of the First Period Reserve Account to be applied for the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations. Such application may affect the amounts which would otherwise",p,
"have been payable to Noteholders and, in particular, may reduce amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
4.7 Characteristics and Risks relating to the Portfolio,p,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Secured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds), Unsecured Senior Obligations (which may consist of Unsecured Senior Loans and/or Unsecured Senior Bonds), Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"An investment in the Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of the Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each of the Classes of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are “Defaulted Obligations”.",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield bond, senior secured bond and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"Characteristics of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds",p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that, as of the Effective Date, at least 92.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations (which shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account and the Unused Proceeds Account, in each case as at the relevant Measurement Date). Investors should note that Secured Senior Obligations are defined as Secured Senior Loans and/or Secured Senior Bonds and at least 70.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Loans. Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations (including such obligations that are Secured Senior Bonds) may not comprise more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount. Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively)",p,
"to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the Obligor in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Secured Senior Obligations, and Unsecured Senior Obligations and, in some but not all cases, High Yield Bonds are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with the security claim in respect of Second Lien Loans being subordinated thereto and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. High Yield Bonds may represent a senior or subordinated claim, both in respect of security and of ranking of the debt claim represented thereby. Secured Senior Obligations and (to a lesser extent) High Yield Bonds are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Senior Obligations may be in the form of loans or a security, which may present different risks and concerns. Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Obligations do not have the benefit of such security. Secured Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example, High Yield Bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at 4.17 (“Interest Rate Risk”) below.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical Senior Loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond, Unsecured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond, Unsecured Senior Bond or High Yield Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer. See also 4.10 (“Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders”) in respect of the Issuer’s interest in syndicated loan facilities.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable Underlying Instrument) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the Obligor a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. However, in the case of EURIBOR, as of 3 December 2018, the calculation of two month and nine month EURIBOR was ceased. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders or bondholders,p,
"to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of, principal of the loans or bonds. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may share many similar features with other loans, bonds and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan or bond may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees. In addition, Floating Rate Collateral Obligations are similar in nature to Cov-Lite Loans and typically do not provide for financial covenants and thus, may result in difficulties in triggering a default. See “Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks”.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds",p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the Underlying Instrument relating to such Senior Loan or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the loan, Senior Loans and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds have been predominantly commercial banks and investment banks. The range of investors for such obligations has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and investment managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk in the event that such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Loans, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds, Unsecured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to their bondholders may typically be less than would be provided on a Senior Loan.",p,
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Loan and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,
Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Loans. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors,p,
"thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies. Mezzanine Obligations are likely to be subject to intercreditor arrangements that may include restrictions on the ability of the holders of the relevant Mezzanine Obligations from taking independent enforcement action.",p,
Prepayment Risk,p,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds and Unsecured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or make whole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
Defaults and Recoveries,p,
"There is limited historical data available as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds and no assurance can be given as to the levels of default and/or recoveries that may apply to any Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds purchased by the Issuer. As referred to above, although any particular Senior Obligation, Mezzanine Obligation or High Yield Bond often will share many similar features with other loans, securities and obligations of its type, the actual terms of any particular Senior Obligation, Mezzanine Obligation or High Yield Bond will have been a matter of negotiation and will thus be unique. The types of protection afforded to creditors will therefore vary from investment to investment. Recoveries on Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds may also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different jurisdictions, the availability of comprehensive security packages in different jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation are uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative investment managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and/or High Yield Bonds therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity or an extension of its maturity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the Obligor continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable",p,
"legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for Obligors with little connection to the UK. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes. In addition, the Collateral Manager has the ability, at any time during the Reinvestment Period, to direct the Issuer to enter into Bankruptcy Exchanges where Defaulted Obligations can be exchanged for other debt obligations issued by another obligor which, but for the fact that such debt obligation is a Defaulted Obligation or Credit Risk Obligation would otherwise qualify as a Collateral Obligation, but there can be no guarantee that such new obligations will have a better likelihood of recovery or are of better value or quality than the Defaulted Obligations being exchanged.",p,
"In some European jurisdictions, obligors or lenders may seek a “scheme of arrangement”. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. Recoveries on both Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See 4.21 (“Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations”) below.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Portfolio may consist of Cov-Lite Loans, subject to the Portfolio Profile Tests which provide that not more than 25.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must be comprised of Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants but they usually have incurrence covenants in the same manner as a High Yield Bond. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such Collateral Obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loan as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,
"The definition of Cov-Lite Loan does not include any loan that, although it has no maintenance or incurrence covenants, contains a cross default or cross acceleration provision to another obligation of the Obligor that requires it to comply with such covenants (each, an “excluded loan”). If the application of such covenants is subject to certain conditions (for example, in the case of a revolver, the condition that such revolver has been drawn above a certain threshold), and those conditions have not been satisfied, such covenants will afford no protection to the Issuer. As a result of the ownership of such excluded loans and Cov-Lite Loans, the Issuer’s exposure to losses may be increased, which could result in an adverse impact on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.",p,
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Obligations,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds in aggregate. Such Collateral Obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Obligations will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Obligations occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of High Yield Bonds, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations in aggregate. High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.",p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by investors in determining whether to purchase the Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Notes.",p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash-generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue-generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European High Yield Bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See 4.21 (“Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations”) below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.",p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, High Yield Bonds frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 7.5 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of Second Lien Loans, Unsecured Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds in aggregate and further that not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations in aggregate. The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a pledge of collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the Obligor. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors;",p,
"(b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in-possession” financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,
"For the purposes of the foregoing, “Senior Loan” means a Collateral Obligation that is a Secured Senior Loan, an Unsecured Senior Loan or a Second Lien Loan.",p,
4.8 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,p,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
"4.9 Participations, Novations and Assignments",p,
"The Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may acquire interests in Collateral Obligations which are loans either directly (by way of novation or assignment) or indirectly (by way of sub participation). Each institution from which such an interest is taken by way of participation or acquired by way of assignment is referred to herein as a “Selling Institution”. Interests in loans acquired directly by way of novation or assignment or participation are referred to herein as “Assignments”. Interests in loans acquired indirectly by way of sub-participation are referred to herein as “Participations”.",p,
"The purchaser of an Assignment typically succeeds to all the rights of the assigning Selling Institution and becomes entitled to the benefit of the loans and the other rights of the lender under the Underlying Instrument. The Issuer, as an assignee, will generally have the right to receive directly from the Obligor all payments of principal and interest to which it is entitled, provided that notice of such Assignment has been given to the Obligor. As a purchaser of an Assignment, the Issuer typically will have the same voting rights as other lenders under the applicable Underlying Instrument and will have the right to vote to waive enforcement of breaches of covenants. The Issuer will generally also have the same rights as other lenders to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the Underlying Instrument, to set off claims against the Obligor and to have recourse to collateral supporting the loan. As a result, the Issuer will generally not bear the credit risk of the Selling Institution and the insolvency of the Selling Institution should have no effect on the ability of the Issuer to continue to receive payment of principal or interest from the Obligor once the novation or assignment is complete. The Issuer will, however, assume the credit risk of the Obligor. The purchaser of an Assignment also typically succeeds to and becomes entitled to the benefit of any other rights of the Selling Institution in respect of the loan agreement including the right to the benefit of any security granted in respect of the loan interest transferred. The Underlying Instrument usually contains mechanisms for the transfer of the benefit of the loan and the security relating thereto. The efficacy of these mechanisms is rarely tested, if ever, and there is debate amongst counsel in continental jurisdictions over their effectiveness. With regard to some of the Underlying Instrument, security will have been granted over assets in different jurisdictions. Some of the jurisdictions will require registrations, filings and/or other formalities to be carried out not only in relation to the transfer of the loan but, depending on the mechanism for transfer, also with respect to the transfer of the benefit of the security.",p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise of Participations and also require the limits set out in the Bivariate Risk Table determined by reference to the ratings of Selling Institutions to be satisfied. Participations by the Issuer in a Selling Institution’s portion of the loan typically results in a contractual relationship only with such Selling Institution and not with the Obligor under such loan. The Issuer would, in such case, only be entitled to receive payments of principal and interest to the extent that the Selling Institution has received such payments from the Obligor. In purchasing Participations, the Issuer generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the Obligor with the terms of the applicable Underlying Instrument and the Issuer may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the loan in respect of which it has purchased a Participation. As a result, the Issuer will assume the credit risk of both the Obligor and the Selling Institution selling the Participation. In the event of the insolvency of the Selling Institution selling a Participation, the Issuer may be treated as a general creditor of the Selling Institution and may not benefit from any set off between the Selling Institution and the Obligor and the Issuer may suffer a loss to the extent that the Obligor sets off claims against the Selling Institution. The Issuer may purchase a Participation from a Selling Institution that does not itself retain any economic interest in the loan, and therefore, may have limited interest in monitoring the terms of the Underlying Instrument and the continuing creditworthiness of the Obligor. When the Issuer holds a Participation in a loan it generally will not have the right to participate directly in any vote to waive enforcement of any covenants breached by an Obligor. A Selling Institution voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant may have interests which are different from those of the Issuer and such Selling Institution may not be required to consider the interest of the Issuer in connection with the exercise of its votes. Whilst the Issuer may have a right to elevate a Participation to a direct interest in the participated loan, such right may be limited by a number of factors.",p,
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” above.",p,
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments.,p,
4.10 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
4.11 Corporate Rescue Loans,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Corporate Rescue Loans. Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
A Corporate Rescue Loan is secured where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law and it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or Section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest and principal (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.,p,
4.12 Bridge Loans,p,
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 5.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may be comprised of Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are generally a temporary financing instrument and as such the interest rate may increase after a short period of time in order to encourage an Obligor to refinance the Bridge Loan with more long-term financing. If an Obligor is unable to refinance a Bridge,p,
"Loan, the interest rate may be subject to an increase and as such Bridge Loans may have greater credit and liquidity risk than other types of loans.",p,
4.13 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations will consist of any Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations or Post-Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations (each as defined below) determined by the Collateral Manager in its sole discretion in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and any warrant, equity security or debt obligation, in each case excluding any Exchanged Security, but including without limitation, warrants relating to Mezzanine Obligations and any equity security received upon conversion or exchange of, or exercise of an option under, or otherwise in respect of a Collateral Obligation; or any warrant, equity security or debt obligation purchased independently or as part of a unit with a Collateral Obligation (but in all cases, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Obligation (if any)), in each case, the acquisition or reclassification (as applicable) of which will not result in the imposition of any present or future, actual or contingent liabilities or obligations on the Issuer other than those which may arise at its option.",p,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may (acting on behalf of the Issuer), in its sole discretion reclassify as a Collateral Enhancement Obligation",p,
"(i) any Non-Eligible Issue Date Collateral Obligations (as reclassified by the Collateral Manager hereunder, “Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations”) provided the aggregate Reclassification Price (as defined below) in respect thereof is no greater than €10,000,000) or (ii) any assets held by the Issuer that do not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria after the Issue Date (whether on the date they were required to do so or thereafter) or that do not satisfy the Restructured Obligation Criteria at the Restructuring Date (if applicable) (as reclassified by the Collateral Manager hereunder, “Post-Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations” and together with any Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations, “Ineligible Portfolio Obligations”), provided that any such assets may only be reclassified if an amount representing the market value thereof (or, in the sole discretion of the Collateral Manager, any greater amount) as at the relevant date of such reclassification (such date, the “Reclassification Date” and such amount the “Reclassification Price”) is, on the Reclassification Date, either:",p,
"in respect of any Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations, credited to the Unused Proceeds Account as a Collateral Manager Advance to be made on the Issue Date by the Collateral Manager to be applied towards such reclassification; or",p,
"in respect of any Post-Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligations, credited to the Principal Account out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time, or from the proceeds of a Collateral Manager Advance or as a permitted use of certain other proceeds specified to be used to acquire Collateral Enhancement Obligations.",p,
"Any transfer of a Reclassification Price and the related reclassification of a Collateral Obligation as a Collateral Enhancement Obligation shall be deemed to be the acquisition of a Collateral Enhancement Obligation and the sale of the relevant Collateral Obligation, in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Any such reclassification so deemed to be a sale of the relevant Collateral Obligation shall therefore only be permissible if such reclassification satisfies the relevant criteria and terms in respect of the sale of any Collateral Obligation in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations, and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amounts which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are subject to the following restrictions: (i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed",p,

All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid out of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment (or on any Business Day, at the Collateral Manager’s discretion, out of the proceeds standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account). Each Collateral Manager Advance shall be in an amount no less than",p,

There can therefore be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. If sufficient amounts are not so available, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, fund the payment of any shortfall by way of a Collateral Manager Advance. However, the Collateral Manager is under no obligation to make any Collateral Manager Advance. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,

Furthermore, in the event that an asset did not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria on the date on which the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer entered into a binding commitment to acquire it, the Collateral Manager will be required to sell such asset, however, in respect of any Post-Issue Date Ineligible Portfolio Obligation, such asset shall no longer be required to be sold but shall instead constitute a Collateral Enhancement Obligation.",p,

The Reclassification Price transferred to the Principal Account or the Unused Proceeds Account, as applicable for such Ineligible Portfolio Obligations in connection with any reclassification thereof as a Collateral Enhancement Obligation is likely to be less than the purchase price originally paid by the Issuer. As well as the relevant Eligibility Criteria in respect of the Ineligible Portfolio Obligation not being satisfied, events occurring between the time at which the Issuer enters into a binding commitment to acquire such obligation and the Reclassification Date, including changes in prevailing interest rates, prepayments of principal, developments or trends in any particular industry, changes in the financial condition of the Obligors of Ineligible Portfolio Obligations, the timing of purchases prior to the Reclassification Date and a number of other factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including the condition of certain financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events, could adversely affect the market value of the",p,

Conversely, in the event that the market value of the relevant Ineligible Portfolio Obligation after the Reclassification Date is greater than the market value thereof at the Reclassification Date, any proceeds in respect thereof will constitute Collateral Enhancement Obligation Proceeds (rather than Principal Proceeds) and will be available for distribution (including in accordance with the Interest Priority of Payments) in accordance with Condition 3(l)(vi) (Supplemental Reserve Account), (rather than for reinvestment in Collateral Obligations or repayment of the Rated Notes).

4.14 Counterparty Risk,p,
"Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"In the event that a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the terms of the applicable Hedge Agreement will generally provide for a termination event unless such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other strategy that results in the rating of the Rated Notes being maintained at their then current level within the remedy period specified in the ratings methodology of the Rating Agencies or take other actions subject to Rating Agency Confirmation. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction (see 4.17 (“Interest Rate Risk”) and 4.18 (“Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions – Currency Risk” below). For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. In the event that the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement on substantially the same terms as the Agency Agreement within the time limits for such action set out in the Transaction Documents.",p,
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or,p,
similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” above.,p,
4.15 Concentration Risk,p,
"The Issuer will invest in Collateral Obligations consisting primarily of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds. Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio — Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”. Although the resulting diversification of the Portfolio may reduce the risk described above, the diversification requirements applicable to the Issuer may cause the Issuer to invest in Obligors or industries that suffer more defaults than if the Issuer were not required to invest in a diversified portfolio.",p,
4.16 Credit Risk,p,
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,
4.17 Interest Rate Risk,p,
"The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate based on EURIBOR. It is possible that Collateral Obligations (in particular Secured Senior Bonds and High Yield Bonds) may bear interest at fixed rates and there is no requirement that the amount or portion of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes must bear interest on a particular basis, save for the Portfolio Profile Test which requires that not more than 10.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Fixed Rate Collateral Obligations.",p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch, and/or a floating rate basis mismatch (including in the case of Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments which pay a floating rate based on a benchmark other than EURIBOR), maturity date mismatch and mismatch in timing of determination of the applicable floating rate benchmark, in each case between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of the applicable floating rate benchmark could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into the Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof and subject to satisfaction of the Hedging Condition, discussed in 2.8 “Commodity Pool Regulation” above. However, the Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any",p,
"such termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer’s exposure to interest rate exposure increasing, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See further “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
"Collateral Obligations may pay interest on a semi-annual basis. In addition, some Collateral Obligations permit the Obligor to reset the applicable interest period from quarterly to semi-annual (and vice versa). Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event (as described below) and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations pay interest on a semi-annual basis there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any such timing mismatch, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”) (at all times other than following the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event when interest on the Notes will switch to semi-annual pay). In addition, to mitigate reset risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations reset from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate such timing and interest reset risks.",p,
"There may be a timing or interest rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the Floating Rate Collateral Obligations as the interest rate on such Floating Rate Collateral Obligations may adjust more frequently or less frequently, on different dates and based on different indices as compared to the interest rates on the Notes. As a result of such risks, an increase in the level of EURIBOR could adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and the Eligible Investments will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes.",p,
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank and the Custodian. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,

Currency Risk,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that not more than 20.0 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations.

"Obligations must be Currency Hedge Obligations or Principal Hedged Obligations, as the case may be, and some may be Unhedged Collateral Obligations. Accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may lead to the proceeds of the Collateral Obligations being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Notes. The Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) is also authorised to enter into spot exchange transactions, as necessary, to fund the Issuer’s payment obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction.",p,
"Furthermore, although the Issuer may enter in FX Forward Transactions in respect of Principal Hedged Obligations, such FX Forward Transactions will not, among other things, hedge income and will not, in the case of credit losses, fully hedge principal risk.",p,
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations may have an associated Currency Hedge Transaction which will include currency protection provisions, losses may be incurred due to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rates and in the event of a default by the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty under any such Currency Hedge Transaction. In addition, fluctuations in Euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof upon enforcement of the security over it. Furthermore, the terms of the Hedge Agreements may provide for the ability of the Hedge Counterparty to terminate such Hedge Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including related to certain regulatory matters. Any such termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction, and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Hedge Counterparty. See further “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
"In addition, it may be necessary for the Issuer to make substantial upfront payments in order to enter into currency hedging arrangements on the terms required by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, and the Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including any termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.",p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events increase the risk of a mismatch between the Currency Hedge Transactions and the Non-Euro Obligations which may result in losses. In addition, the Collateral Manager may be limited at the time of reinvestment in the choice of Non-Euro Obligations that it is able to purchase on behalf of the Issuer because of the cost of such hedging and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect to such hedging.",p,
"The Issuer will depend on each Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Currency Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and, if any Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its currency risk exposure.",p,
4.19 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,
"To the extent the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of",p,
"Principal Proceeds (see 3.7 (The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of the Reinvestment Period) above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the yield of the Portfolio. Any decrease in the yield on the Portfolio will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer on the Issue Date and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of, and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of Underlying Instruments and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the Obligors thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior Obligations usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes, then by holders of the Class Z Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
4.20 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test are sensitive to variations in the ratings applicable to the underlying Collateral Obligations. Generally, deteriorations in the business environment or increases in the business risks facing any particular Obligor may result in downgrade of its obligations, which may result in such obligation becoming a Credit Risk Obligation, a S&P CCC Obligation or Moody’s Caa Obligation (and therefore potentially subject to haircuts in the determination of the Par Value Tests and restriction in the Portfolio Profile Tests) or a Defaulted Obligation. The Collateral Management and Administration Agreement contains detailed provisions for determining the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating in respect of a Collateral Obligation. In some instances, the Moody’s Rating and the S&P Rating will not be based on or derived from a public rating of the Obligor or the actual Collateral Obligation but may be",p,
"based on either a private rating of the Obligor or Collateral Obligation or, in certain cases, on a confidential credit estimate determined separately by Moody’s and/or S&P. Such private ratings and confidential credit estimates are private and therefore not capable of being disclosed to Noteholders. In addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different Rating Agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the Moody’s Rating is derived from an S&P Rating. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Coverage Tests and the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.",p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised as of the date of this Offering Circular, despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set out in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of Moody’s Caa Obligations and S&P CCC Obligations and/or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders. See Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests).",p,
4.21 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,p,
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.",p,
"The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.",p,
4.22 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of Obligors to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the Obligor or has assumed a degree of control over the Obligors resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the Obligors or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of the",p,
"Obligor to the detriment of other creditors of such Obligor, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control the Obligor to the detriment of other creditors of such Obligor, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
4.23 Loan Repricing,p,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the Subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,
"Downward movements in interest rates could also adversely affect the performance of non-investment grade bonds with call or redemption features. Such a call or redemption feature would permit the obligor of such debt securities to repurchase such securities from the Issuer. If a call were exercised by such an obligor during a period of declining interest rates, the Issuer likely would have to replace such called non-investment grade Collateral Obligations with lower yielding Collateral Obligations.",p,
4.24 Changes in Tax Law; No Gross Up; General,p,
"At the time when the Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer (or, in the case of the Issue Date Collateral Obligations, on the Issue Date), the Eligibility Criteria require that payments on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax or other similar tax (other than U.S. withholding tax on commitment fees, amendment fees, waiver fees, consent fees, letter of credit fees, extension fees, or similar fees) imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can be eliminated by application being made under a double tax treaty or otherwise, (ii) the relevant Obligor will be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of such withholding tax, (iii) such withholding tax is imposed under FATCA as a result of the Issuer being unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA due to (x) a holder or beneficial owner of a Note failing to provide the required information to comply with FATCA or otherwise causing the Issuer to be unable to achieve or maintain compliance with FATCA or",p,

However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation",p,
"thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations (including payment by Selling Institutions in the case of Participations) might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor (or, in the case of Participations, the Selling Institution) will not be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may, where relevant, be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between Ireland and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made, (b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the relevant Obligor or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross without withholding or deduction of tax. In the event that the Issuer receives any payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes and may also give rise to a “Collateral Tax Event” and an Optional Redemption subject to and in accordance with the Conditions. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest, principal on the Maturity Date and other amounts payable in respect of the Notes of each Class.",p,

"In the context of the activities to be carried out under the Transaction Documents, the Issuer will be subject to UK corporation tax if it is: (i) tax resident in the UK or (ii) carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment.",p,
"As the Issuer is incorporated in Ireland, the Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is outside the UK. The Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes. The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or if it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to habitually exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer in the UK. The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.",p,
"Even if the Issuer is regarded as carrying on a trade in the UK through the agency of the Collateral Manager for the purposes of UK taxation, it will not be subject to UK corporation tax in respect of the agency of the Collateral Manager if the exemption in Article 5(6) of the double taxation treaty between Ireland and the United Kingdom (“UK-Ireland Treaty”) applies. This exemption will apply if the Collateral Manager, in acting on behalf of the Issuer, is regarded as an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of the UK-Ireland Treaty. It should be noted that the specific domestic UK corporation tax exemption for profits generated in the UK by an investment manager on behalf of its non-resident clients (section 1146 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) may not be available in the context of this transaction if the Collateral Manager (or certain connected entities) holds more than 20 per cent. of the relevant disregarded income of the Issuer (for the purposes of section 1148 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) (including as part of its holding of the Retention Notes). However, the inapplicability of this domestic exemption should not, in accordance with H.M. Revenue & Customs’ guidance which is current as at the date of this Offering Circular, have any effect on the UK tax position of the Issuer if the exemption in Article 5(6) of the UK-Ireland Treaty, as referred to above, applies.",p,
"Should the Collateral Manager be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it will be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer (subject to any claim by the Issuer in respect of any related Collateral Manager Breach). Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer as specified in the relevant Priorities of Payment. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under paragraphs (C) and (Z) of the Interest Priority of Payments, paragraphs (A) and (S) of the Principal Priority of Payments or paragraphs (C) and (T) of the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be",p,
"made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay, under paragraph (A) of the Interest Priority of Payments, Principal Priority of Payments or the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments, as applicable, UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK for UK tax purposes (such payment to be made in accordance with the relevant Priorities of Payment). Imposition of such tax by the United Kingdom tax authorities may also give rise to a “Note Tax Event” subject to and in accordance with the Conditions and in certain circumstances the Rated Notes may be redeemed (in whole but not in part) at the option of either (i) the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Noteholders in each case acting by Extraordinary Resolution or (ii) the Collateral Manager. See Condition 7(g) (Redemption following a Note Tax Event).",p,
"The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a “trade of dealing in or developing UK land”, (b) it disposes of “interests in UK land” or certain assets other than “interests in UK land” which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a “substantial indirect interest” in that land, or (c) with effect from 6th April 2020 it carries on a “UK property business” or has other “UK property income”. However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.",p,
4.26 Collateral Manager,p,
"The Collateral Manager will be appointed by the Issuer to act as collateral manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio” and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The powers and duties of the Collateral Manager in relation to the Portfolio will include effecting at its discretion, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement: (a) the acquisition of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period; (b) the sale of Collateral Obligations during the Reinvestment Period (subject to certain limits) and, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain events (including a Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, a Credit Improved Obligation or a Credit Risk Obligation); and (c) the participation in restructuring and work-outs of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer. See “The Portfolio”. Any analysis by the Collateral Manager of Obligors under Collateral Obligations which it is purchasing (on behalf of the Issuer) or which are held in the Portfolio from time to time will, (i) in respect of Collateral Obligations which are publicly listed bonds, be limited to a review of readily available public information, (ii) in respect of Collateral Obligations which are bonds which are not publicly listed, be in accordance with standard review procedures for such type of bonds and, (iii) in respect of Collateral Obligations which are Assignments or Participations of senior and mezzanine loans and in relation to which the Collateral Manager has non-public information, include due diligence of the kind common in relation to senior and mezzanine loans of such kind.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement will place significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations, and the Collateral Manager will be required to comply with the restrictions contained in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of the restrictions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager will not be liable for any losses or damages resulting from the performance of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement except those resulting from acts or omissions constituting bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as interpreted under New York law) or wilful misconduct of the Collateral Manager, provided that nothing shall relieve the Collateral Manager from contractual liability under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement in the event that the Collateral Manager fails to perform its duties in accordance with the Standard of Care, as further described in “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement” below. Investors should note that, for such purpose and notwithstanding that the Notes and the Transaction Documents are governed by English law, the interpretation of “gross negligence” will be pursuant to New York law. Under New York law, the concept of gross negligence is a significantly lower standard of care than negligence under English",p,
"law, requiring conduct akin to intentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference under English law. As a result, the Collateral Manager may in some circumstances have no liability for its actions or inactions under the Transaction Documents where it would otherwise have been liable if a mere negligence standard was applied under English law or if New York law was not designated as the law pursuant to which the concept of gross negligence for this purpose would be interpreted.",p,
"The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history or performance record of its own, other than in respect of the Warehouse Arrangements. The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,
"The performance of other collateralised loan obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.",p,
"The Issuer will be highly dependent on the financial and managerial experience of certain individuals associated with the Collateral Manager in analysing, selecting and managing the Collateral Obligations. There can be no assurance that such key personnel currently associated with the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates will remain in such position throughout the life of the transaction. The loss of one or more of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Issuer.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager may resign or be removed for cause as described herein under “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.",p,
"It should be noted that upon the appointment of a successor collateral manager, the Trustee shall be obliged to agree to any amendment to modify the duties, fees (and in the case of any modification which increases the Senior Management Fees) and obligations of such collateral manager under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, subject only to the prior consent of the Subordinated Noteholders acting by Ordinary Resolution and the Controlling Class acting by Extraordinary Resolution (in each case excluding (x) any CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes, (y) any CM Non-Voting Notes and (z) any Notes held by the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates and/or any Notes over which the Collateral Manager or any Affiliate thereof has discretionary voting authority) and each other party to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement but without the consent of any other Class of Noteholders or any other Secured Party.",p,
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.,p,
"The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,
4.27 No Initial Purchaser Role Post-Closing,p,
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,
4.28 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations,p,
The proceeds of the issue of the Notes remaining after payment of:,p,
the acquisition costs for the Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (including other amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations); and,p,
"certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes,",p,
"will be transferred from the Unused Proceeds Account and deposited in the Expense Reserve Account, the First Period Reserve Account and the Unused Proceeds Account on the Issue Date.",p,
"The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Unused Proceeds Account during the Initial Investment Period. The Collateral Manager’s decisions concerning purchases of Collateral Obligations will be influenced by a number of factors, including market conditions and the availability of securities and loans satisfying the Eligibility Criteria, Reinvestment Criteria and the other requirements of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The failure or inability of the Collateral Manager to acquire Collateral Obligations with the proceeds of the offering or to reinvest Sale Proceeds or payments and prepayments of principal in Substitute Collateral Obligations in a timely manner will adversely affect the returns on the Notes, in particular with respect to the most junior Class or Classes.",p,
"Notwithstanding the above, on and after the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager will have the ability to purchase Loss Mitigation Loans which shall not be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer) enters into a binding commitment to purchase such obligation, but will only be designated as a Collateral Obligation by the Collateral Manager in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes, then by the holders of the Class Z Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
4.29 Retention Financing,p,
"The Retention Holder intends to enter into financing arrangements in respect of the Retention Notes that it is required to acquire in order to comply with the EU Retention Requirements (any such arrangements, the “Retention Financing Arrangements”), and in respect of any Retention Financing Arrangements, will either grant security over, or transfer title to, the Retention Notes in connection with such financing. If the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would retain the economic risk in the Retention Notes but not legal ownership of them. None of the Collateral Manager, the Retention Holder, any Agent, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that such Retention Financing Arrangements will comply with the EU Retention Requirements. In particular, should the Retention Holder default in the performance of its obligations under the Retention Financing Arrangements, the lender or lenders thereunder would have the right to enforce the security granted by the Retention Holder, including effecting the sale or appropriation of some or all of the Retention Notes or, if the collateral arrangements in respect of such Retention Financing Arrangements are by way of title transfer, the Retention Holder would not be entitled to have the Retention Notes (or equivalent securities) returned to it. In exercising its rights pursuant to any Retention Financing Arrangements, any lender would not be required to have regard to the EU Retention Requirements and any such sale or appropriation may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Initiatives – Risk Retention and Transparency Requirements – EU Retention and Transparency Requirements” and see “Conflicts of Interest – Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates”. Additionally, a default by a financing counterparty under a Retention Financing Arrangement that was effected by way of title transfer may also result in the Retention Notes failing to be returned to the Retention Holder. Although the Collateral Manager may direct a Regulatory Refinancing and purchase additional Notes thereunder in order to maintain compliance with the EU Retention Requirements and/or the U.S. Retention Regulations (if applicable), there can be no assurance that the Regulatory Refinancing in accordance with Condition 7(b)(viii) (Optional Redemption effected through Regulatory Refinancing) will be viewed effective for such purposes by the applicable governmental authorities. See Condition 7(b)(viii) (Optional Redemption effected through Regulatory Refinancing).",p,
"The term of any Retention Financing Arrangements may be considerably shorter than the effective term of the Notes, and separately, or as a result of other terms of the Retention Financing Arrangements may require the Retention Holder to repay or refinance the Retention Financing Arrangements whilst some or all Classes of Notes are Outstanding. If refinancing opportunities were limited at such time and the Retention Holder was unable to repay the retention financing from its own resources, the Retention Holder could, subject to being so permitted or required by the terms of the Retention Financing Arrangements, be forced to sell some or all of the Retention Notes in order to obtain funds to repay the retention financing without regard to the EU Retention Requirements, and such sales may therefore cause the transaction described in this Offering Circular to be non-compliant with the EU Retention Requirements.",p,
4.30 Regulatory Risk,p,
"In many jurisdictions, especially in continental Europe, engaging in lending activities “in” certain jurisdictions whether conducted via the granting of loans, purchases of receivables, discounting of invoices, guarantee transactions or otherwise (collectively, “Lending Activities”) is generally considered a regulated financial activity and, accordingly, must be conducted in compliance with applicable local banking laws. In many such jurisdictions, there is comparatively little statutory, regulatory or interpretive guidance issued by the competent authorities or other authoritative guidance as to what constitutes the conduct of Lending Activities in such jurisdictions.",p,
"As such, Collateral Obligations may be subject to these local law requirements. Moreover, these regulatory considerations may differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled, on the type of Obligor and other considerations. Therefore, at the time when Collateral Obligations are acquired by the Issuer, there can be no assurance that, as a result of the application of regulatory law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof by the relevant governmental body or agency,",p,
"or change in such application or interpretation thereof by such governmental body or agency, payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future be adversely affected as a result of such application of regulatory law or that the Issuer might become subject to proceedings or action by the relevant governmental body or agency, which, if determined adversely to the Issuer, may adversely affect its ability to make payments in respect of the Notes.",p,
4.31 Ownership of Collateral Obligations through one or more Issuer Subsidiaries,p,
Some of the Collateral Obligations and other assets of the Issuer may be held by one or more subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any such Issuer Subsidiary may be,p,
"(i) subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (and possibly a branch profits tax as well) and/or interest and penalties, (ii) subject to a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax on some or all of its income, and/or (iii) required to withhold tax in respect of any distributions it makes to the Issuer. No opinion of counsel will be received regarding the U.S. federal income or other tax treatment of the Issuer Subsidiary. Taxes incurred or withheld by the Issuer Subsidiary may reduce amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Issuer, and subsequently available for distribution to investors.",p,
4.32 Valuation Information; Limited Information,p,
"None of the Initial Purchaser, the Sole Arranger, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee and Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.",p,
4.33 Recharacterisation of Trading Gains,p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in its discretion, direct that all or part of any Trading Gains which would have been deposited into the Principal Account and designated for reinvestment or used to redeem the Notes in accordance with the Principal Priority of Payments are instead deposited into the Interest Account, subject to certain conditions, including the Class F Par Value Ratio being at least equal to the Issue Date Class F Par Value Ratio after giving effect to any such deposit. Such Trading Gains will then be distributed as Interest Proceeds in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. As a result, such Trading Gains would not be available to be reinvested in Collateral Obligations and therefore the Aggregate Principal Balance of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes may be less than what would have otherwise been the case if such amounts had been reinvested in Collateral Obligations. See Condition 3(l)(ii) (Interest Account).",p,
5. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,p,
"The Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates,p,
"The following briefly summarises certain potential and actual conflicts of interest which may arise from the overall investment activity of the Collateral Manager, its clients and its affiliates, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts. The scope of the activities of the affiliates of the Collateral Manager and the funds and clients advised by affiliates of the Collateral Manager may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time.",p,
"On the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager expects to purchase the Retention Notes. The Collateral Manager and one or more of its Collateral Manager Related Persons may from time to time hold other",p,
"Notes of any Class. Although the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager Related Persons and/or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager may at times be Noteholders, the interests and incentives for such Noteholders will not necessarily be aligned with those of the other Noteholders of any particular Class. The Collateral Manager may rebate or otherwise not receive a portion of the Collateral Management Fees that relate to the ownership, if any, of Notes by certain Collateral Manager Related Persons. Such an arrangement may affect the incentives of the Collateral Manager in managing the Collateral Obligations or the Loss Mitigation Loans and may also affect the actions or inactions of that Noteholder in taking (or failing to take) any actions it may be permitted to take under the Trust Deed and other Transaction Documents, including votes concerning amendments.",p,
"If the Collateral Manager Related Persons or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager collectively become the holders of a majority of the Subordinated Notes, they will have the ability to direct the Issuer and the Trustee to take, or not to take, certain actions in their capacity as Noteholders. Holders of a majority of the Subordinated Notes may, amongst other things and subject to other conditions or restrictions that may apply: (i) nominate a successor collateral manager if the Collateral Manager resigns or is removed for cause, (ii) direct certain redemptions or prevent other holders of Notes from directing those redemptions, (iii) consent to the issuance of additional notes by the Issuer and (iv) consent to or direct certain refinancings of the Notes. If such parties become the holders of not less than 66⅔ per cent. of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Subordinated Notes, the Collateral Manager Related Persons or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager will also have the ability, subject to certain conditions, to direct an optional redemption in whole pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event) or to prevent the other holders of Subordinated Notes from directing an optional redemption in whole pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Redemption Following Note Tax Event). Any such rights afforded to the Collateral Manager Related Persons or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager in their capacities as holders will be in addition to any contractual rights (including certain consent rights) available to the Collateral Manager in its capacity as such.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager may discuss the composition of the Collateral Obligations and other matters relating to the transactions contemplated hereby with other Collateral Manager Related Persons or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager and may have such discussions with other beneficial owners of Notes or stakeholders in the Issuer, other transaction parties or other Persons. There can be no assurance that any such discussions will not influence the actions or inactions of the Collateral Manager. As a Noteholder, each of the Collateral Manager Related Persons (or any Affiliate of the Collateral Manager as the investment adviser to a Collateral Manager Related Person or other parties related to or affiliated with the Collateral Manager) will be free to exercise the voting, consent and other rights of the Notes in whatever way each determines to be in its own interests and without taking into account the interests of the other Noteholders.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may only be removed for “cause”, notwithstanding any losses that Noteholders may realise upon their investments in Notes. See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement – Removal of the Collateral Manager for Cause”. Any Notes held by (i) Collateral Manager Related Persons shall not have any voting rights in respect of, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Removal Resolution; and (ii) the Collateral Manager shall not have any voting rights in respect of, and shall not be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the results of voting on any CM Replacement Resolution following a CM Removal Resolution.",p,
"The Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates or the Collateral Manager Related Persons may also have ongoing relationships with companies whose securities or loans are pledged to secure the Secured Obligations and may own debt and equity securities of issuers or obligors of Collateral Obligations. As a result, officers of the Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and the Collateral Manager Related Persons may possess information relating to issuers or obligors of Collateral Obligations which is not known to the individuals at the Collateral Manager responsible for monitoring the Collateral Obligations or performing obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, and such officers will be under no obligation to make such information available to those responsible for monitoring the applicable Collateral Obligations or performing obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Additionally, the",p,
"Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and other Collateral Manager Related Persons may receive fees or other benefits for these services which are greater than any fees the Collateral Manager is receiving for its services to the Issuer. This disparity in fee income may create potential conflicts of interest relating to the Collateral Manager’s obligations to the Issuer and its and/or any such Affiliate’s or Collateral Manager Related Persons’ obligations to such other clients. The Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and other Collateral Manager Related Persons may also carry on investment activities for their own accounts and for family members and friends who do not invest in the Issuer, and may give advice and recommend investments to other managed accounts or investment funds which may differ from advice given to, or investments recommended for, the Issuer, even in cases where their investment objectives may be the same or similar.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and other Collateral Manager Related Persons may invest in securities or loans that are pari passu, senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations of the Issuer. In such instances, the Collateral Manager, such Affiliates and other Collateral Manager Related Persons may in their discretion, subject to certain restrictions, make investment recommendations and decisions that may be the same as or different from those made with respect to the Issuer’s investments. The Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and other Collateral Manager Related Persons currently, and/or may in the future, serve as collateral manager for, invest in or be affiliated with other entities organised to issue collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) or collateralised bond obligations (CBOs) secured or backed by assets similar to the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates may at certain times be simultaneously seeking to purchase or sell investments for the Issuer and any similar entity for which it serves as collateral manager at such time, or for its affiliates (including any account, portfolio or investment company for which the Collateral Manager or any affiliate serves as manager or investment advisor). Other entities for which the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates serve as collateral manager may have investment objectives, programs, strategies and positions that are similar or dissimilar to or may conflict with those of the Issuer. Also, such other entities may invest in businesses that compete with, have interests adverse to, or are affiliated with the issuers or obligors of assets held by the Issuer, which could adversely affect the performance of the Issuer. There is no assurance that any such other entities with investment objectives, programs or strategies similar to those of the Issuer will hold the same positions or perform in a substantially similar manner as the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates may give advice or take action with respect to the investments of other Collateral Manager Related Persons which may differ from the advice given or the timing or nature of any action taken with respect to investments of the Issuer. As a result of such advice or actions, the prices and availability of securities and other financial instruments in which the Issuer invests or may seek to invest, and the performance of the Issuer, may be adversely affected.",p,
"When buying and selling assets for client accounts, including the Issuer, other CLO, CDO, CBO or similar clients and Collateral Manager Related Persons, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates generally aggregate multiple transactions into one order so that multiple accounts may participate equally over time on a fair and equitable basis, in terms of best available cost, efficiency and terms under the circumstances. Although certain accounts may be excluded from a given aggregated order, no account is favoured over any other account on an overall, long-term basis. Each account that participates in an aggregated order participates at the average price, except as noted below. Typically transaction costs are shared pro rata based on each account’s participation in the transaction. In certain transactions, prices may differ as a result of differences in fees, taxes and transaction charges that are assessed on each participating account and vary depending upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the domicile of the account, the size of participating accounts or amounts allocated. The Collateral Manager will determine whether an asset is appropriate for one or more of their respective CLO, CDO, CBO or similar clients on the basis of a number of factors including each such client’s eligibility criteria, concentration limitations and portfolio tests, both at the time of such determination and prospectively, in addition to any other factors relevant at the time. It is possible, due to differing investment objectives or other reasons, that the Collateral Manager may purchase assets for one client or account and sell such assets for another client or account.",p,
"Portfolio transactions for the Issuer, other CLO, CDO, CBO or similar clients and for Collateral Manager Related Persons are allocated to broker-dealers on the basis of best execution available in light of the overall quality of brokerage, prime brokerage, financing and other services provided to the Issuer. In",p,
"seeking best execution, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates may consider a variety of factors including quality of execution, reputation, financial strength and stability, block trading and block positioning capabilities, willingness and ability to execute difficult transactions, willingness and ability to commit capital, access to underwritten offerings and secondary markets, ongoing reliability, overall costs of a trade including commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs or spreads in the context of the Collateral Manager’s knowledge of negotiated commission rates currently available and other current transaction costs, nature of the investment and the available market makers, desired timing of the transaction and size of trade, confidentiality of trading activity and other similar services.",p,
"Certain separately managed accounts or funds managed by the Collateral Manager and one or more of its Affiliates may require the Collateral Manager or such Affiliates to apply a different valuation methodology in valuing specific investments than the valuation methodology set forth in the Transaction Documents for the Issuer. As a result of such different methodology, the value of certain investments held in such separately managed accounts or funds managed by the Collateral Manager may differ from the value assigned to the same investments held by the Issuer by the Transaction Documents.",p,
"Although the Collateral Manager will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager deems appropriate, in order to satisfy its obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager may have conflicts in allocating its time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager Related Persons. In addition, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates, in connection with their other business activities, may acquire material non-public confidential information and enter into non-disclosure agreements that may restrict the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates from purchasing investments or selling investments for themselves or their respective clients (including the Issuer) or otherwise using such information for the benefit of their respective clients or themselves.",p,

Furthermore, the Collateral Manager and any of its Affiliates may make an investment on behalf of any Collateral Manager Related Persons without offering the investment opportunity or making any investment on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager, one or more of its Affiliates and any of the Collateral Manager Related Persons may make an investment on its own behalf without offering the investment opportunity to, or the Collateral Manager making any investment on behalf of, the Issuer.

The Collateral Manager, each of its Affiliates and each of the Collateral Manager Related Persons has no affirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before engaging in any investments for itself. The Collateral Manager may make investments on behalf of the Issuer in assets that it has declined to invest in for its own account, the account of any Collateral Manager Related Persons or the account of its other clients.

In such a case, the Issuer will purchase investments held by one or more of the Collateral Manager Related Persons, or will sell investments to one or more of the Collateral Manager Related Persons. The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates will effect these transactions only (i) when the Collateral Manager and, if applicable, one or more of its Affiliates deem the transaction to be in the best interest of both the Issuer and the applicable Collateral Manager Related Person and (ii) at a price and under circumstances that the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates have determined, by reference to independent market indicators, to constitute Best Execution for the Issuer and the applicable Collateral Manager Related Person. “Best Execution” means the method whereby the Collateral Manager takes all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible results for the Issuer in accordance with The Handbook of Rules and Guidance of the FCA, as amended, varied or substituted from time to time. Neither the Collateral Manager nor any of its Affiliates receives any compensation in connection with “cross” transactions. To the extent that any such transactions may be viewed as a principal transaction, the Collateral Manager will comply with the written policies and procedures of the Collateral Manager then in effect regarding cross trades and principal transactions as well as applicable law. “Inadvertent” cross transactions may also occur when trades cross in the market. For example, when the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates periodically rebalance accounts, certain Collateral Manager Related Persons may sell investments into the market at the same time that other Collateral Manager Related Persons and/or the Issuer are purchasing the same investments in the market, resulting in an inadvertent or “deemed” market cross. In these cases, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates ensure that an independent broker-dealer establishes the price for the transaction. In these situations, the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates do not instruct the broker to directly move positions between accounts.",p,

In addition, the Collateral Manager shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of Class Z Notes to a successor collateral manager and such successor collateral manager would have to agree to the same or substantially similar fee arrangements. This may make it more difficult to assign the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement or to find a successor collateral manager upon a resignation of the Collateral Manager.",p,

SCM has significant economic and business interests and objectives that are different than or conflict with those of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager Related Persons. Accordingly, the interests of shareholders of SCM may not be aligned with the interests of the Noteholders. In situations where these interests are not aligned, the Collateral Manager faces a conflict of interest when it acts or fails to act. In this regard, SCM has direct relationships with counterparties of Collateral Manager Related Persons—certain counterparties provide underwriting, consulting, administration and financing services to SCM. In particular, a financial services firm that provides a significant amount of services to Collateral Manager Related Persons (such as prime brokerage, custodial, administration and other services) has been a major source of liquidity to SCM through a term loan facility, the terms of which are disclosed in SCM’s public disclosure documents, which are available at www.sec.gov.

6. REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING OR RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL MANAGER AND ITS AFFILIATES,p,
"The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (together with the DOJ, the “Offices”) and the SEC brought certain proceedings against SCM, certain of SCM’s subsidiaries and affiliates, and others in connection with payments to government officials to obtain investments by a foreign sovereign wealth fund in certain hedge funds managed by certain of SCM’s subsidiaries and affiliates in 2007, and similar payments relating to private investments",p,
in Africa between 2007 and 2011 by private equity funds and investment vehicles managed by SCM’s subsidiaries and affiliates.,p,
"As part of the settlement in connection with these matters, SCM entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with the Offices, and its subsidiary OZ Africa Management GP, LLC (“OZ Africa”) agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Court”) on September 29, 2016, to one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). SCM also agreed to settle an administrative proceeding with the SEC involving violations of the FCPA and of the Investment Advisers Act. SCM paid a total of $412.1 million in penalties and disgorgement in connection with the above.

7. IRISH LAW,p,
Preferred creditors under Irish law,p,
"Under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security that may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (that may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) that have been approved by the Irish courts. See the section entitled “Examinership” below.",p,
"The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company (that would include the Issuer) may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those that the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company.",p,
"Where notice has been given to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 calendar days of its creation by the holder of the security, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of VAT) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security.",p,
"The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax, whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",p,
"In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company that are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security.",p,
"The essence of a fixed charge is that the chargor does not have liberty to deal with the assets that are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer, any charge constituted by the Trust Deed may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge.",p,
"In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables, it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the moneys standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee.",p,
"Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security purported to be created by the Trust Deed would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge.",p,
"Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following:",p,
"(a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off;",p,
"(b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up;",p,
(c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities;,p,
(d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and,p,
(e) they rank after fixed charges.,p,
Examinership,p,
"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Irish Companies Act 2014 (as amended), to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties.",p,
"The Issuer, the Directors, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer, are each entitled to petition the Irish Circuit Court or High Court (as appropriate) (each an “Irish Examinership Court”) for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after his appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his appointment. Furthermore, he may sell assets which are the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised he must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to them out of the proceeds of sale.",p,
"During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the appropriate Irish Examinership Court when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the appropriate Irish Examinership Court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement.",p,
"In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the Noteholders. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the appropriate Irish Examinership Court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the",p,
"proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the Noteholders, especially if such proposals include a writing down of the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the Noteholders. The primary risks to the holders of Notes if an examiner were to be appointed in respect of the Issuer are as follows:",p,
(a) the potential for a scheme of arrangement to be approved involving the writing down of the debt owed by the Issuer to the Noteholders as secured by the Trust Deed;,p,
(b) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and,p,
"(c) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish Examinership Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the secured creditors under the Notes or under any other secured obligations.",p,

The Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,p,
"The “Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test” will be satisfied as at any Measurement Date from (and including) the Effective Date, if the Diversity Score is more than or equal to the number set forth in the column entitled “Minimum Diversity Score” in the Moody’s Test Matrix based upon the applicable “row/column” combination chosen by the Collateral Manager (or interpolating between two adjacent rows and/or two adjacent columns (as applicable)).",p,
"The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration in terms of both issue and industry concentration. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of issue and industry concentration. For the purposes of calculating the Diversity Score, Obligors that are considered to be members of the same Affiliated Group (as of the most recent date of inclusion in the Portfolio of any of the relevant Obligors) will be considered to be one Obligor. The Diversity Score is calculated as follows:",p,
"“Affiliated Group”: an Obligor is a member of an affiliated group if it is owned by such group, directly or indirectly, by more than 50 per cent;",p,
obligors that are constituted of one or more Affiliated Groups shall be counted as being in the industry that generated the highest turnover as reported in the latest financial statements of the Obligor;,p,
an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the quotient of (A) the aggregated Principal Balance of such Obligor and (B) the Average Principal Balance;,p,
an “Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Geographically Based Industry Classification by adding the Equivalent Unit Scores for all Obligors in the same Geographically Based Industry Classification (or such other Geographically Based Industry Classifications and Equivalent Unit Scores as are published by Moody’s from time to time);,p,
(i) Environmental Industries;,p,
(ii) Sovereign & Public Finance;,p,
(iv) Utilities: Oil & Gas; and,p,
"(v) Utilities: Water,",p,
"for those groups not listed above, “Geographically Based Industry Classification” means those Obligors which have the same Moody’s industry classification, irrespective of domicile or country of incorporation;",p,
"a “Geographic Zone” means each of (a) Region 1, (b) Region 2, (c) Region 3, (d) Region 4 and (e) Other, as shown in the table “Region for Diversity Score” in Annex D (Moody’s Region for Diversity Score) (or such other Geographic Zone as may be published by Moody’s from time to time). Thus a “local” company in Region 1 may be considered as a different industry group to an entity in the same sector but domiciled in Region 2; and",p,
"an “Industry Diversity Score” is established by reference to the Diversity Score Table shown below (or such other Diversity Score Table as is published by Moody’s from time to time) (the “Diversity Score Table”) for the related Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score. If the Aggregate Industry Equivalent Unit Score falls between any two such scores shown in the Diversity Score Table, the Industry Diversity Score is the lower of such scores.",p,
The Diversity Score is then calculated by adding the Industry Diversity Scores for each Geographically Based Industry Classification and then rounding the result to the nearest whole number.,p,

Irish Taxation,p,
Withholding Tax,p,
"In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent), is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest. However, an exemption from withholding on interest payments exists under Section 64 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 of Ireland, as amended (the “TCA”) for certain interest bearing securities issued by a body corporate (such as the Issuer) which are quoted on a recognised stock exchange (which would include trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin) (“quoted Eurobonds”).",p,
"the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and either:",p,
the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to the person by or through whom the payment is made in the prescribed form.,p,
Section 110 of the TCA (a “Qualifying Company”) and provided the interest is paid to a person resident in either,p,
"A payment of profit dependent or excessive interest on the Notes will not be re-characterised as a distribution to which dividend withholding tax could apply where, broadly the Noteholder, is either",p,
"for so long as the Notes remain quoted Eurobonds, neither a person which is a company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer or which is controlled by a third company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer or a person (including any connected person) (a) from whom the Issuer has acquired assets, (b) to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances, (c) a person to whom loans or advances held by the Issuer were made or (d) with whom the Issuer has entered into a return agreement (as defined in section 110(1) of the TCA) where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or agreements represents 75 per cent. or more of the assets of the Issuer (such a person falling within this category of person being a “Specified Person”); or",p,

A “specified mortgage” for this purpose is:,p,
"a specified agreement which derives all of its value, or the greater part of its value, directly or indirectly, from land in Ireland or a loan to which paragraph (a) applies. A specified agreement is defined in Section 110 TCA and includes certain derivatives, swaps or similar arrangements. A specified mortgage does not",p,
any portion of a specified security issued by another qualifying company which carries on the business of holding or managing specified mortgages and which carries a right to results dependent or non-commercial interest.,p,
"Where the qualifying company has financed itself with loans carrying interest which is dependent on the results of that company’s business or interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return for the use of the principal, or has entered into specified agreements (such as swaps) then the interest or return payable will not be deductible for Irish tax purposes to the extent it exceeds a reasonable commercial return which is not dependent on the results of the qualifying company.",p,

"the Issuer does not hold or manage specified mortgages, units in an IREF (within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 of the TCA) or shares that derive their value or the greater part of their value, directly or indirectly, from Irish real estate; or",p,
Taxation of Noteholders,p,
"Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax, the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish income tax. Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore be within the charge to Irish income tax and the universal social charge. Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of income tax and any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within its scope.",p,
"In addition, provided that the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and are exempt from withholding tax as set out above, the interest on the Notes will be exempt from Irish income tax if the recipient of the interest is (i) a company under the control, directly or indirectly, of persons who by virtue of the law of a relevant territory are resident in that country and that person or persons are not themselves under the control whether directly or indirectly of a person who is not resident in such a country, or (ii) a company, the principal class of shares of such company, or another company of which the recipient company is a 75 per cent. subsidiary, is substantially and regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges in Ireland or a relevant territory or a stock exchange approved by the Irish Minister for Finance.",p,
Noteholders receiving interest on the Notes which does not fall within any of the above exemptions may be liable to Irish income tax and the universal social charge on such interest.,p,
Capital Acquisitions Tax,p,
"A gift or inheritance comprising of Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situate in Ireland.",p,
Stamp Duty,p,
"Provided the Issuer remains a Qualifying Company no stamp duty or similar tax is imposed in Ireland on the issue, transfer or redemption of the Notes provided the money raised on the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer’s business.",p,
"with which Ireland has a double tax treaty, then the relevant interest will be treated as a distribution for Irish tax purposes.",p,
Automatic exchange of information,p,
"Irish reporting financial institutions, which may include the Issuer have reporting obligations in respect of a Noteholder under FATCA as implemented pursuant to the Ireland – U.S. intergovernmental agreement and/or the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (see below).",p,
FATCA may impose a 30 per cent. U.S. withholding tax on certain ‘withholdable payments’ unless the payee enters into and complies with an agreement with the IRS to collect and provide to the IRS substantial information regarding direct and indirect owners and account holders.,p,
"Under the IGA and the Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 as amended (the “Irish Regulations”) implementing the information disclosure obligations Irish reporting financial institutions are required to report certain information with respect to U.S. account holders to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The Irish Revenue Commissioners will automatically provide that information annually to the IRS. To the extent the Issuer is an Irish reporting financial institution it will need to obtain the necessary information from Noteholders required to satisfy the reporting requirements whether under the IGA, the Irish Regulations or any other applicable legislation published in connection with FATCA and such information may be sought from each Noteholder and beneficial owner of the Notes. It should be noted that the Irish Regulations require the collection of information and filing of returns with the Irish Revenue Commissioners regardless as to whether the Issuer holds any U.S. assets or has any U.S. investors. However to the extent that the Notes are listed on a recognised stock exchange and regularly traded (i.e. listed with the intention that the interests may be traded) and/or are held in a recognised clearing system the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year. In that event the Issuer, if an Irish reporting financial institution, will make a nil return for that year to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Where the Notes do not satisfy the ‘regularly traded’ requirement and are not, or are no longer held, in a clearing system then the Issuer will need to report annually on its U.S. reportable accounts to the extent it has any. In this regard it will need to have a way of having the requisite information collected on its behalf. Holders should obtain independent tax advice in relation to the potential impact of FATCA before investing.",p,
"For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is:",p,
" a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) that is created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia;",p,

"In the case of a partnership (or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a beneficial owner of a Note, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership (or other equity holder of such other pass-through entity) will generally depend on the status of such partner (or other equity holder) and upon the activities of such pass-through entity. Partners of partnerships (or other equity holders of other pass-through entities, as applicable) that are beneficial owners of Notes should consult their tax advisors.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Issuer,p,
"The Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will receive an opinion of Paul Hastings LLP, counsel to the Collateral Manager, generally to the effect that, although no activity closely comparable to that contemplated by the Issuer has been the subject of any Treasury regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision and thus the matter is not free from doubt, assuming compliance with the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including certain tax guidelines referenced therein (the “Tax Guidelines”), and based upon certain factual representations made by the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager, and subject to other customary assumptions and qualifications, the contemplated activities of the Issuer will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current law. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address any other issue. Failure of the Issuer or the Collateral Manager to comply with the Tax Guidelines, the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement may result in the Issuer being subject to U.S. federal income tax, but may not give rise to a default or a Note Event of Default under the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and may not give rise to a claim against the Issuer or the Collateral Manager. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer could be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf) is permitted to take certain actions prohibited under the Tax Guidelines if it obtains written advice from Paul Hastings LLP or Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP or an opinion of other tax counsel of nationally recognised standing in the United States experienced in such matters, that the departure will not cause the Issuer to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of Paul Hastings LLP will not address those situations and there can be no assurances that any such opinion or advice of tax counsel will be consistent with Paul Hastings LLP’s current views and opinion standards. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager is not obliged to monitor (and in some cases, conform the Issuer’s activities in order to comply with) changes in law that could affect whether the Issuer is treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The Collateral Manager, if it does not have actual knowledge of a relevant change in law, might act in accordance with the Tax Guidelines notwithstanding the issuances of new decisions by the courts, new legislation or official guidance (regardless of whether such new interpretation, legislation or guidance would either merely increase the risk that the Issuer would be, or actually cause the Issuer to be, engaged in a U.S. trade or business). In addition, the opinion of Paul Hastings LLP is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Moreover, a change in law or its interpretation could result in the Issuer being treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (notwithstanding that the Collateral Manager is acting in accordance with the Tax Guidelines). Finally, the Trust Deed could be amended in a manner that permits or causes the Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion described above does not address those situations.",p,
U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes,h3,
"The Issuer intends to treat the Subordinated Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each holder by its purchase of a Subordinated Note agrees to treat the Subordinated Notes consistently with this treatment.",p,
"This discussion, and the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP described above, do not address the effects of any supplemental trust deeds.",p,
"In general, U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes that use the cash method of accounting will calculate the U.S. dollar value of payments of stated interest based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the time a payment is received.",p,
Accrual basis U.S. Holders of Class A Notes or Class B Notes also will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest payments on their Class A Notes or Class B Notes to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of such payments (based on the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date such payments are,p,
"Original Issue Discount. In addition, if the discount at which a substantial amount of the Class A Notes or Class B Notes is first sold to investors is at least 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of the Class, multiplied by the number of complete years to the weighted average maturity of the Class, then the Issuer will treat the Class as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID with respect to a Note within the Class will equal the excess of the principal amount of the Note over its issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes within the Class was sold to investors). U.S. Holders of Notes that are issued with OID will be required to include the U.S. dollar value of OID in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In general, U.S. Holders of the Class A Notes or Class B Notes will calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate during the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the average euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of Class A Notes or Class B Notes can elect to calculate the U.S. dollar value of OID based on the euro-to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the applicable Accrual Period (or, with respect to an Accrual Period that spans two taxable years, at the euro-to-U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the last day of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year) or, if the last day of the Accrual Period is within five business days of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the payment of accrued OID, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Any such election must be applied to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.",p,
"A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting). Accruals of any such OID generally will be made using a constant yield method, based on the weighted average life of the applicable Class rather than its stated maturity, possibly with periodic adjustments to reflect the difference between (x) the prepayment assumption under which the weighted average life was calculated and (y) actual prepayments on the Collateral Obligations.

Accruals of OID on the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes, and Class F Notes will be calculated by assuming that interest will be paid over the life of the applicable Class based on the value of EURIBOR used in setting the interest rate for the first Accrual Period, and then adjusting the accrual for each subsequent Accrual Period based on the difference between the value of EURIBOR used in setting interest for that subsequent Accrual Period and the assumed rate.

Possible Treatment of Class E Notes and Class F Notes as Equity for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes,p,
"As described above under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of the Notes”, the Issuer intends to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state, and local income and franchise tax purposes, and the Trust Deed requires Noteholders to treat the Class E Notes and Class F Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. Nevertheless, the IRS could assert, and a court could ultimately hold, that the Class E Notes and Class F Notes are equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer, the Issuer is a controlled foreign corporation (a “CFC”), and a U.S. Holder of such Notes also is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, then the U.S. Holder generally would be subject to the rules discussed below under “U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes—Investment in a Controlled Foreign Corporation” with respect to its Class E Notes and Class F Notes.",p,
"In addition, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes represent equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of such Notes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 with the IRS if (i) such person is treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the U.S. Holder’s purchase of Notes, at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the Issuer or (ii) the amount of cash transferred by such person (or any related person) to the Issuer during the 12-month period ending on the date of such purchase exceeds $100,000.

U.S. Federal Tax Treatment of U.S. Holders of Subordinated Notes,h3,
"U.S. Holder will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain. In addition, any losses of the Issuer in a taxable year will not be available to the U.S. Holder and may not be carried back or forward in computing the Issuer’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years. If applicable, the rules relating to a CFC, discussed below generally override those relating to a PFIC with respect to which a QEF election is in effect.",p,
"The Issuer will provide, upon request and at the Issuer’s expense, all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder of Subordinated Notes making a QEF election with respect to the Issuer is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",p,
"U.S. Holder will also be liable for an interest charge (which is nondeductible to individuals) as if such income tax liabilities had been due with respect to each such year. For purposes of these rules, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganisations and use of the Subordinated Notes as security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions of such Subordinated Notes. In addition, a stepped-up basis in the Subordinated Notes will not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. Holder who has not made a timely QEF election with respect to the Issuer.",p,
"In many cases, the U.S. federal income tax on any gain on disposition or receipt of Excess Distributions is likely to be substantially greater than the tax if a timely QEF election is made. A U.S. HOLDER OF SUBORDINATED NOTES SHOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER MAKING A QEF ELECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER.",p,
"If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for the period during which the Issuer remains a CFC and the U.S. Holder remains a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer (the “qualified portion” of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes). As a result, to the extent the Issuer’s subpart F income includes net capital gains, such gains will be treated as ordinary income to the 10 per cent. United States shareholder under the CFC rules, notwithstanding the fact that the character of such gains generally would otherwise be preserved under the QEF rules. If the qualified portion of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes subsequently ceases (either because the Issuer ceases to be a CFC or the U.S. Holder ceases to be a 10 per cent. United States shareholder), then solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will be treated as beginning on the first day following the end of such qualified portion, unless the U.S. Holder has owned any Subordinated Notes for any period of time prior to such qualified portion and has not made a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In that case, the Issuer will again be treated as a PFIC which is not a QEF with respect to the U.S. Holder and the beginning of the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Subordinated Notes will continue to be the date upon which the U.S. Holder acquired the Subordinated Notes, unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to recognise gain with respect to the Subordinated Notes and a QEF election with respect to the Issuer. In the event that the Issuer is a CFC, then, at the request and expense of any U.S. Holder that is a 10 per cent. United States shareholder with respect to the Issuer, the Issuer will provide the information necessary for the U.S. Holder to comply with any filing requirements that arise as a result of the Issuer’s classification as a CFC.",p,
"In particular, a U.S. Holder of an indirect equity interest in a PFIC is treated as owning the PFIC directly. The",p,
"Accordingly, if the U.S. Holder has not made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder would be subject to the adverse consequences described above under “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company” with respect to any Excess Distributions of such indirectly held PFIC, any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder on the sale by the Issuer of such PFIC, and any gain indirectly realised by such U.S. Holder with respect to the indirectly held PFIC on the sale by the U.S. Holder of its Subordinated Notes (which may arise even if the U.S. Holder realises a loss on such sale). Moreover, if the U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to the indirectly held PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of its pro rata share of the indirectly held PFIC’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as if the indirectly held PFIC were held directly (as described above), and the U.S. Holder will not be permitted to use any losses or other expenses of the Issuer to offset such ordinary earnings and/or net capital gains. Accordingly, if any of the Collateral Obligations are treated as equity interests in a PFIC, U.S. Holders could experience significant amounts of “phantom” income with respect to such interests.",p,
"Distributions. The treatment of actual distributions of cash on the Subordinated Notes will vary depending on whether the U.S. Holder of such Subordinated Notes has made a timely QEF election (as described above). See “Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company”. If a timely QEF election has been made, distributions should be allocated first to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) and to this extent will not be taxable to such U.S. Holder. Distributions in excess of such previously taxed amounts will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Subordinated Notes (as described below under “Sale, Redemption, or Other Disposition”), and then as a disposition of a portion of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, a U.S. Holder will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to amounts previously taxed pursuant to the QEF election (or pursuant to the CFC rules, if applicable) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the distribution on the date received and the U.S. dollar value of the previously taxed amount. Any exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss.",p,

The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Subordinated Notes will be increased by amounts taxable to the U.S. Holder by reason of any QEF election, or by reason of the CFC rules, as applicable, and decreased by the U.S. dollar value of actual distributions by the Issuer that are deemed to consist of such previously taxed amounts or are treated as a nontaxable return of capital, as described above under “Distributions”.",p,
"If the Issuer is treated as a CFC and a U.S. Holder is treated as a 10 per cent. United States shareholder of the Issuer, then any gain or loss realised by the U.S. Holder upon a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Subordinated Notes, other than gain or loss subject to the PFIC rules, if applicable, generally will be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and taxable as ordinary income or loss, to the extent of the positive or negative change in the U.S. dollar value of any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the CFC rules from the date of each deemed distribution pursuant to the CFC rules (based on the average euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the applicable taxable year) to the date of the disposition. Any gain in excess of foreign currency exchange gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Issuer’s previously untaxed earnings and profits.",p,
"Receipt of Euro. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in any euro received in respect of the Notes on a sale, redemption, or other disposition of the Notes equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro on that date.

3.8 per cent. Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income”,h3,
"U.S. Holders that are individuals or estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 per cent. tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income”, or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8 per cent. Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax and special rules apply with respect to the PFIC and CFC rules described above.

The U.S. Risk Retention Rules prohibit the “sponsor” or its “majority-owned affiliates”, as applicable, from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the “credit risk” during the period of time that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules require that the risk be retained.",p,

VOLCKER RULE,p,
"Under Section 619 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the corresponding implementing rules (the “Volcker Rule”) relevant banking entities (as defined under the Volcker Rule) are generally prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or acting as sponsor in respect of, certain investment entities referred to as covered funds. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Volcker Rule restricts relevant banking entities from entering into certain credit exposure related transactions with covered funds.",p,
"An “ownership interest” is broadly defined and may arise through a holder’s exposure to the profit and losses of the covered fund, as well as through any right of the holder to participate in the selection of an investment advisor, manager, or board of directors of the covered fund.",p,
"The Class X Notes shall not carry any rights to vote in respect of, or be counted for the purposes of determining a quorum and the result of any votes in respect of any CM Removal Resolutions or any CM Replacement Resolutions. There can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in investments in the Class X Notes by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
"The Issuer may be deemed to be a “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule and, in such circumstances, in the absence of regulatory relief, the provisions of the Volcker Rule and its related regulatory provisions, will severely limit the ability of U.S. “banking entities” and non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. banking institutions to hold an ownership interest in the Issuer or enter into financial transactions with the Issuer. If the Issuer is deemed to be a “covered fund”, this could significantly impair the marketability and liquidity of the Refinancing Notes.",p,
"It should be noted that the Subordinated Notes will be characterised as ownership interests in the Issuer for this purpose and it is uncertain whether any of the Rated Notes may be similarly characterised as ownership interests. For instance, there is currently uncertainty as to whether the rights of Noteholders to participate in the removal of, and/or selection of a replacement for, the Collateral Manager in and of itself will be construed as indicative of an ownership interest by the Noteholders of the relevant Class.",p,
"The Transaction Documents provide that the right of holders of the Notes in respect of the removal of the Collateral Manager and selection of a replacement collateral manager shall only be exercisable upon a Collateral Manager Event of Default. The holders of any Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes or Class D Notes in the form of CM Non-Voting Exchangeable Notes or CM Non-Voting Notes are disenfranchised in respect of any CM Removal Resolution or CM Replacement Resolution. However, there can be no assurance that these features will be effective in resulting in such investments in the Issuer by U.S. banking institutions and other banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule not being characterised as an “ownership interest” in the Issuer.",p,
"There is limited interpretive guidance regarding the Volcker Rule, and implementation of the regulatory framework for the Volcker Rule is still evolving. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and lack of interpretive guidance could negatively impact the liquidity and value of the Refinancing Notes. Any entity that is a “banking entity” as defined under the Volcker Rule and is considering an investment in the Refinancing Notes should consider the potential impact of the Volcker Rule in respect of such investment and on its portfolio generally.",p,
"Each purchaser must determine for itself whether it is a banking entity subject to regulation under the Volcker Rule. None of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser makes any representation regarding (i) the status of the Issuer under the Volcker Rule or (ii) the ability of any purchaser to acquire or hold the Refinancing Notes, now or at any time in the future.

Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Refinancing Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Refinancing Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.",p,

1.1 General,p,
"The composition of the Collateral Obligations will change over time as a result of: (i) scheduled and unscheduled principal payments on the Collateral Obligations; (ii) sales of Collateral Obligations and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds and other Principal Proceeds; and (iii) other factors, subject to the limitations described in the Conditions and the Transaction Documents.",p,

1.5 Business and Regulatory Risks for Vehicles with Investment Strategies such as the Issuer’s,p,
"As discussed further in “European Union and Euro Zone Risk” below, it is possible that countries that have adopted the Euro could return to a national currency. The effect on a national economy as a result of it leaving the Euro is impossible to predict. The exit of one or more countries from the Euro zone could have a destabilising effect on all European economies and possibly the global economy as well.",p,
"Difficult macro-economic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realisation value of the Collateral. Default rates on loans and other investments may continue to fluctuate and accordingly the performance of many collateralised loan obligation (“CLO”) transactions and other types of investment vehicles may suffer as a result. It is also possible that the Collateral will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.",p,
"1.7 Illiquidity in the collateralised debt obligation, leveraged finance and fixed income markets may affect the Noteholders",p,
1.8 European Union and Euro Zone Risk,p,
"As a confidence building measure, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Subsequently, the European Council agreed that Euro zone countries would establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Euro zone countries which has been active since July 2013.",p,
"On 23 June 2016, the UK held an advisory referendum with respect to its continued membership of the EU (the “Referendum”). The result of the Referendum was a vote in favour of leaving the EU. Whilst the result of the Referendum itself is clear, the next steps of the UK executive and UK Parliament and the reaction of the other Member States to these steps is not. In particular, the format of the negotiations, the negotiation positions of the participants and timeframe are uncertain, with any limited public statements subject to change.",p,
"The UK government gave formal notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 on 29 March 2017, which triggered the commencement of a negotiation process between the UK and the EU in respect of the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Article 50 provides for a two year period for such negotiations to take place (unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK unanimously decides to extend this period, in respect of which see below) (the “Article 50 Period”).",p,
Applicability of EU law in the UK,p,
"However, the UK government needs the approval of the UK Parliament in order to ratify the negotiated withdrawal agreement, which has not yet been forthcoming.",p,
"On 9 September 2019, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 received Royal Assent and passed into law. This legislation provided that if by 19 October 2019, either a deal had not been ratified by the UK Parliament or “no deal” had not been approved by the UK Parliament, the UK Government would be required to request from the EU an extension to the UK’s departure date to 31 January 2020 (or another date if the UK Parliament approved a date suggested by the EU). Although the UK Government and the EU reached an agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement on 17 October 2019, this revised deal had not been approved by the UK Parliament by 19 October 2019. On that day, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, the UK Government sent a request for a further extension to the Article 50 Period to the President of the EU Council. This request was accompanied, however, by a further communication indicating that the UK Government did not wish the EU to grant such an extension.",p,
"Upon any withdrawal from the EU by the UK, and subject to agreement on (and the terms of) any future UK-EU relationship, EU law will cease to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Over the years, English law has been devised to function in conjunction with EU law (in particular, laws relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, financial collateral, settlement finality and market infrastructure). As a result, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, substantial amendments to English law may occur. Consequently, English law may change and it is impossible at this time to predict the consequences on the Portfolio or the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Such changes could be materially detrimental to Noteholders.",p,
"by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to operate effectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may be brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests.",p,
"In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there has been, and there continues to be, increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial institutions, “shadow banking entities” and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitisation exposures and/or the incentives for certain investors to hold or trade asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities.",p,
"In December 2017, the BCBS announced a set of amendments to the Basel III package, described by some commentators as “Basel IV”. These reforms introduce significant limitations on the ability of banks to reduce their capital requirements through their calculation of risk weighted assets (“RWAs”) using the Internal Ratings Based approach (the “IRB Approach”). The reforms include revisions to the IRB Approach for credit risk, revised minimum capital requirements for market risk, revisions to the credit value adjustment risk framework, amendments to the leverage ratio exposure measure and the introduction of a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), which will take the form of a Tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a G-SIB’s risk-weighted capital buffer. The reforms also introduce an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks' RWAs generated by internal models used in the IRB approach are no lower than 72.5% of RWAs as calculated by the Basel III framework's standardised approaches. The Basel IV reforms will have to be implemented by January 2022, with the exception of the new output floor requirement, which will phased in between 1 January 2022 and the end of 2026, becoming fully effective on 1 January 2027.",p,

If the Issuer is considered to be a member of a “group” (as defined in EMIR) (which may, for example, potentially be the case if the Issuer is consolidated by a Noteholder as a result of such Noteholder’s holding of a significant proportion of the Subordinated Notes) and if the aggregate notional value of OTC derivative contracts entered into by the Issuer and any non- financial entities within such group exceeds the applicable thresholds (excluding eligible hedging transactions), the Issuer would be subject to the clearing obligation, or if the relevant contract is not a type required to be cleared, to the risk mitigation obligations, including the margin requirement.

The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd- Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of the business of the Collateral Manager, including securitisation, proprietary trading, investing, creation and management of investment funds, OTC derivatives and other activities. While many regulations implementing various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing regulations have not yet been proposed.

"On 28 June 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a decision in Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. v. Bank of America National Association, et al. Case No. 10-3547 (In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), Chapter 11 Case No. 10-03547 (Bankr S.D.N.Y. June 208, 2016). In this decision, the court held that not all priority of payment provisions would be unenforceable ipso facto clauses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the court identified two materially distinct approaches to such provisions. Where a counterparty’s automatic right to payment priority ahead of the noteholders is “flipped” or modified upon, for example, such counterparty’s default under the swap document, the court confirmed that such priority provisions were unenforceable ipso facto clauses. Conversely, the court held that priority provisions where no right of priority is established until after a termination event under the swap documents has occurred were not ipso facto clauses, and, therefore, fully enforceable. Moreover, even where the provisions at issue were ipso facto clauses, the Court found that they were nonetheless enforceable under the Code’s safe harbour provisions. Specifically, the Court concluded that priority of distribution was a necessary part of liquidation of a swap agreement, which the safe harbour provisions expressly protect. The Court effectively limited the analysis in the BNY Case to instances where the flip provisions are only in an indenture, and do not constitute part of the swap agreement. This judgment highlights the difference in approach taken between U.S. and English law on this subject, although it significantly reduces the practical differences in outcome. Lehman filed a notice of appeal with regards to this decision on 6 February 2017. In addition, there remain several actions in the U.S. commenced by debtors of Lehman Brothers concerning the enforceability of flip clauses and this is likely to be an area of continued judicial focus particularly in respect of multi-jurisdictional insolvencies.",p,

Any such consent, if withheld, may prevent the modification, amendment or supplement of the Transaction Documents which may be beneficial to or in the best interests of the Noteholders.",p,
"The requirements described above could result in the Controlling Class being unable to procure enforcement of the security over the Collateral in circumstances in which they desire such enforcement (in particular, where paragraph (B) above does not apply) and may also result in enforcement of such security in circumstances where the proceeds of liquidation thereof would be insufficient to ensure payment in full of all amounts due and payable in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments and/or at a time when enforcement thereof may be adverse to the interests to certain Classes of Notes and, in particular, the Subordinated Notes.",p,

"Under FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30 per cent. withholding tax on certain income.

The Issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with the intergovernmental agreement and the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.

Possible treatment of the Refinancing Notes as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes,p,
"The Class E Notes and Class F Notes could be treated as representing equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are so treated, gain on the sale of a Class E Note or Class F Note could be treated as ordinary income and subject to an additional tax in the nature of interest, and certain interest on the Class E Notes or Class F Notes could be subject to the additional tax. U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may be able to avoid these adverse consequences by filing a protective “qualified electing fund” election with respect to their Class E Notes and Class F Notes. Alternatively, if the Class E Notes or Class F Notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders of those Notes could be subject to the rules pertaining to 10 per cent.

U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes are uncertain,p,
"The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Refinancing Notes are uncertain, as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes.

4. RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL,p,
4.1 The Portfolio,p,
"The decision by any prospective holder of Refinancing Notes to invest in such Refinancing Notes should be based, among other things (including, without limitation, the identity of the Collateral Manager), on the Eligibility Criteria (and the Reinvestment Criteria, when applicable) which each Collateral Obligation is required to satisfy, as disclosed in this Offering Circular, and on the Portfolio Profile Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, Coverage Tests and Target Par Amount that the Portfolio is required to satisfy as at the Effective Date (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date) and in each case thereafter as disclosed in this Offering Circular. This Offering Circular does not contain any information regarding the individual Collateral Obligations on which the Notes will be secured from time to time (other than as disclosed in the latest Payment Date Report and/or latest Monthly Report contained in",p,
"Annex E (Payment Date Report) and Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto and further described in “Risk Factors – General”). Purchasers of any of the Notes will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the investments to be made by the Issuer and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Collateral Manager in acquiring investments for purchase on behalf of the Issuer over time. No assurance can be given that the Issuer will be successful in obtaining suitable investments or that, if such investments are made, the objectives of the Issuer will be achieved.",p,
"None of the Issuer, the Sole Arranger or the Initial Purchaser has made any investigation into the Obligors of the Collateral Obligations. The value of the Portfolio may fluctuate from time to time (as a result of substitution or otherwise) and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty or any of their Affiliates are under any obligation to maintain the value of the Collateral Obligations at any particular level. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Collateral Manager, any Collateral Manager Related Person, the Collateral Administrator, any Hedge Counterparty, the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any liability to the Noteholders as to the amount or value of, or any decrease in the value of, the Collateral Obligations from time to time.",p,
"Furthermore, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to carry out due diligence in accordance with the Standard of Care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, to ensure the Eligibility Criteria will be satisfied prior to the entry by the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer)) into a commitment to purchase an asset intended to constitute a Collateral Obligation and that the Issuer will, upon the settlement of such purchase, become the legal and beneficial holder of such Collateral Obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant Underlying Instrument and all applicable laws. Noteholders are reliant on the Collateral Manager conducting such due diligence in a manner which ensures that the Collateral Obligations are properly and effectively transferred and satisfy each of the Eligibility Criteria and, in respect of Collateral Obligations acquired prior to the Issue Date, the Original Eligibility Criteria..",p,
4.2 Nature of Collateral; Defaults,p,
"The Collateral on which the Notes and the claims of the other Secured Parties are secured will be subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The Portfolio of Collateral Obligations which will secure the Notes will be predominantly comprised of Senior Obligations, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds lent to or issued by a variety of Obligors with a principal place of business in a Non-Emerging Market Country which are primarily rated below investment grade.",p,
"The lower rating of below investment grade collateral reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer or borrower or in general economic conditions or both may impair the ability of the relevant issuer or borrower, as the case may be, to make payments of principal or interest. Such investments may be speculative. See “The Portfolio” section of this Offering Circular.",p,
"An investment in the Refinancing Notes of any Class involves a degree of risk arising from fluctuations in the amount and timing of receipt of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations by or on behalf of the Issuer and the amounts of the claims of creditors of the Issuer ranking in priority to the holders of each Class of Notes. In particular, prospective purchasers of such Refinancing Notes should be aware that the amount and timing of payment of the principal and interest on the Collateral Obligations will depend upon the detailed terms of the documentation relating to each of the Collateral Obligations and on whether or not any Obligor thereunder defaults in its obligations.",p,
"The subordination levels of each Class of Notes will be established to withstand certain assumed deficiencies in payment caused by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations. If, however, actual payment deficiencies exceed such assumed levels, payments on the relevant Class of Notes could be adversely affected. Whether and by how much defaults on the Collateral Obligations adversely affect each Class of Notes will be directly related to the level of subordination thereof pursuant to the Priority of Payments. The risk that payments on the Notes could be adversely affected by defaults on the related Collateral Obligations is likely to be increased to the extent that the Portfolio of Collateral Obligations is concentrated in any one issuer, industry, region or country as a result of the increased potential for correlated defaults in respect of a single issuer or within a single industry, region or country as a result of downturns relating generally to such industry, region or country. Subject to any confidentiality",p,
"obligations binding on the Issuer, Noteholders will receive information through the Reports from time to time of the identity of Collateral Obligations which are Defaulted Obligations.",p,
"To the extent that a default occurs with respect to any Collateral Obligation and the Issuer or the Trustee sells or otherwise disposes of such Collateral Obligation, the proceeds of such sale or disposition are likely to be less than the unpaid principal and interest thereon. Even in the absence of a default with respect to any of the Collateral Obligations, the potential volatility and illiquidity of the sub-investment grade high yield and leveraged loan markets means that the market value of such Collateral Obligations at any time will vary, and may vary substantially, from the price at which such Collateral Obligations were initially purchased and from the principal amount of such Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the amount of proceeds of any sale or disposition of such Collateral Obligations at any time, or that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition would be sufficient to repay a corresponding par amount of principal of and interest on the Notes after, in each case, paying all amounts payable prior thereto pursuant to the Priorities of Payment. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any recoveries received in respect of Defaulted Obligations.",p,
4.3 Acquisition of Collateral Obligations Prior to the Issue Date,p,
"On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Forward Purchase Agreement to acquire the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations from Barclays Bank PLC.",p,
"Investors in the Refinancing Notes will be assuming the risk of market value and credit quality changes in each such Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation from the time at which Barclays Bank PLC entered into a binding commitment to acquire such assets following receipt of a request from the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to do so for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, including the risk that any Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations acquired during the period prior to the Issue Date may not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as at the Issue Date",p,
"For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth herein (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation in which the Issuer invests may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be “undervalued” levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even lower levels at a time of valuation or at the time of sale. It may not be possible to predict, or to hedge against, such risk.",p,
"The requirement that the Eligibility Criteria be satisfied applies at the time of entering into a binding commitment to acquire a Collateral Obligation provided that (i) an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation which must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date, (ii) a Collateral Obligation (other than a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation or an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation) purchased prior to the Issue Date must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the date on which a binding commitment to purchase it was entered into and (iii) a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation shall only be required to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at the time the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) requested the acquisition of such obligation for the purposes of onward sale to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement.",p,
4.4 Considerations Relating to the Subsequent Investment Period,p,
"During the Subsequent Investment Period, the Collateral Manager, on behalf of the Issuer will seek to acquire additional Collateral Obligations in order to satisfy as at the Effective Date, the Target Par Amount and each of the Coverage Tests (other than in respect of the Interest Coverage Tests, which are required to be satisfied on and after the Determination Date immediately preceding the second Payment Date), Collateral Quality Tests, and Portfolio Profile Tests. See “The Portfolio”. The ability to satisfy such tests and requirement will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of the Issuer and the Collateral Manager, including the availability of obligations that satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and other Portfolio related requirements in the primary and secondary loan markets, the condition of the financial markets, general economic conditions and international political events. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such tests and requirements will be met. In addition, the ability of the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions upon the acquisition of Non-Euro Obligations will depend on a number of factors outside the control of the Collateral Manager including its ability to identify a suitable Currency Hedge Counterparty with whom the Issuer may enter into Currency Hedge Transactions. See also “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)” above. To the extent it is not possible to purchase such additional Collateral Obligations, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral, and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, may be adversely affected. Such inability to invest may also shorten the weighted average lives of the Notes as it may lead to early redemption of the Notes. To the extent such additional Collateral Obligations are not purchased, the level of income receivable by the Issuer on the Collateral and therefore its ability to meet its interest payment obligations under the Notes, together with the weighted average lives of the Notes, may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Collateral Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) to acquire such additional Collateral Obligations and/or enter into required Currency Hedge Transactions during such period could result in the non-confirmation or downgrade or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its Initial Rating of any Class of Notes. Such non-confirmation, downgrade or withdrawal may result in the redemption of the Notes, shortening their weighted average life and reducing the leverage ratio of the Subordinated Notes to the other Classes of Notes which could adversely affect the level of returns to the holders of the Subordinated Notes. Any such redemption of the Notes may also adversely affect the risk profile of Classes of Notes in addition to the Subordinated Notes to the extent that the amount of excess spread capable of being generated in the transaction reduces as the result of redemption of the most senior ranking Classes of Notes in accordance with the Note Payment Sequence which bear a lower rate of interest than the remaining Classes of Rated Notes.",p,
4.5 Prepayment Risk,p,
"Loans are generally prepayable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the obligor thereof at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Secured Senior Bonds may include obligor call or prepayment features, with or without a premium or makewhole. Prepayments on loans and bonds may be caused by a variety of factors, which are difficult to predict. Accordingly, there exists a risk that loans or bonds purchased at a price greater than par may experience a capital loss as a result of such a prepayment. In addition, Principal Proceeds received upon such a prepayment are subject to reinvestment risk. Any inability of the Issuer to reinvest payments or other proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments and distributions received by the Noteholders and the yield to maturity of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to reinvest proceeds in Collateral Obligations with comparable interest rates in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria or (if it is able to make such reinvestments) as to the length of any delays before such investments are made.",p,
"The effect of an economic downturn on default rates and the ability of finance providers to protect their investment in a default situation is uncertain. Furthermore, the holders of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are more diverse than ever before, including not only banks and specialist finance providers but also alternative collateral managers, specialist debt and distressed debt investors and other financial institutions. The increasing diversification of the investor base has also been accompanied by an increase in the use of hedges, swaps and other derivative instruments to protect against or spread the economic risk of defaults. All of these developments may further increase the risk that historic recovery levels will not be realised. The returns on Senior Obligations and/or Mezzanine Obligations therefore may not adequately reflect the risk of future defaults and the ultimate recovery rates.",p,
"A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a Defaulted Obligation for a variety of reasons. Upon any Collateral Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, such Defaulted Obligation may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial change in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, a conversion of some or all of the principal debt into equity, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such Defaulted Obligation. Junior creditors may find that a restructuring leads to the total eradication of their debt whilst the borrower continues to service more senior tranches of debt on improved terms for the senior lenders. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such Defaulted Obligation. Forum shopping for a favourable legal regime for a restructuring is not uncommon, English law schemes of arrangement having become a popular tool for European incorporated companies, even for borrowers with little connection to the UK. In such instance, a lender may be forced by a court to accept restructuring terms. The liquidity for Defaulted Obligations may be limited, and to the extent that Defaulted Obligations are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate recovery on any Defaulted Obligation will be at least equal either to the minimum recovery rate assumed by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes or any recovery rate used in the analysis of the Refinancing Notes by investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes.",p,
Recoveries on Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations will also be affected by the different bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the Obligors thereunder. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below.,p,
4.7 Underlying Portfolio,p,
Characteristics of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations,p,
"The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that as of the Effective Date, at least 90 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount must consist of Secured Senior Obligations in aggregate (which shall comprise the aggregate of the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Secured Senior Obligations and the Balances standing to the credit of the Principal Account as at the relevant Measurement Date). Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are of a type generally incurred by the Obligors thereunder in connection with highly leveraged transactions, often (although not exclusively) to finance internal growth, pay dividends or other distributions to the equity holders in the Obligor, or finance acquisitions, mergers, and/or stock purchases. As a result of the additional debt incurred by the borrower in the course of such a transaction, the Obligor’s creditworthiness is typically judged by the rating agencies to be below investment grade. Senior Obligations are typically at the most senior level of the capital structure with Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations being subordinated to any Senior Obligations or to any other senior debt of the Obligor. Secured Senior Obligations are often secured by specific collateral, including but not limited to, trademarks, patents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, real estate, franchises and common and preferred stock of the Obligor and its subsidiaries and any applicable associated liens relating thereto. In continental Europe, security is often limited to shares in certain group companies, accounts receivable, bank account balances and intellectual property rights. Second Lien Loans and Mezzanine Obligations may have the benefit of a second priority charge over such assets. Unsecured Senior Loans do not have the benefit of such security. Senior Obligations usually",p,
"have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory prepayments from excess cash flows, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds typically contain bondholder collective action clauses permitting specified majorities of bondholders to approve matters which, in a typical senior loan, would require unanimous lender consent. The Obligor under a Secured Senior Bond may therefore be able to amend the terms of the bond, including terms as to the amount and timing of payments, with the consent of a specified majority of bondholders, either voting by written resolution or as a majority of those attending and voting at a meeting, and the Issuer is unlikely to have a blocking minority position in respect of any such resolution. The Issuer may further be restricted by the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from voting on certain matters, particularly extensions of maturity, which may be considered at a bondholder meeting. Consequently, material terms of a Secured Senior Bond may be varied without the consent of the Issuer.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations generally take the form of medium term loans repayable shortly (perhaps six months or one year) after the senior loans of the obligor thereunder are repaid. Because Mezzanine Obligations are only repayable after the senior debt (and interest payments may be blocked to protect the position of senior debt interest in certain circumstances), it will carry a higher rate of interest to reflect the greater risk of it not being repaid. Due to the greater risk associated with Mezzanine Obligations as a result of their subordination below senior loans of the Obligor, mezzanine lenders may be granted share options, warrants or higher cash paying instruments or payment in kind in the Obligor which can be exercised in certain circumstances, principally being immediately prior to the Obligor’s shares being sold or floated in an initial public offering.",p,
"Some Collateral Obligations may bear interest at a fixed rate, for example high yield bonds. Risks associated with fixed rate obligations are discussed at “Interest Rate Risk” below.",p,
"The majority of Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations bear interest based on a floating rate index, for example EURIBOR, a certificate of deposit rate, a prime or base rate (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) or other index, which may reset daily (as most prime or base rate indices do) or offer the borrower a choice of one, two, three, six, nine or twelve month interest and rate reset periods. The purchaser of an interest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation may receive certain syndication or participation fees in connection with its purchase. Other fees payable in respect of a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, which are separate from interest payments on such loan, may include facility, commitment, amendment and prepayment fees.",p,
"Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations also generally provide for restrictive covenants designed to limit the activities of the Obligors thereunder in an effort to protect the rights of lenders to receive timely payments of interest on, and repayment of principal of the loans. Such covenants may include restrictions on dividend payments, specific mandatory minimum financial ratios, limits on total debt and other financial tests. A breach of covenant (after giving effect to any cure period) under a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation which is not waived by the lending syndicate normally is an event of acceleration which allows the syndicate to demand immediate repayment in full of the outstanding loan. However, although any particular Senior Obligation may share many similar features with other loans and obligations of its type, the actual term of any Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation will have been a matter of negotiation and will be unique. Any such particular loan may contain non-standard terms and may provide less protection for creditors than may be expected generally, including in respect of covenants, events of default, security or guarantees.",p,
"Limited Liquidity, Prepayment and Default Risk in relation to Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations",p,
"In order to induce banks and institutional investors to invest in a Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and to obtain a favourable rate of interest, an Obligor under such an obligation often provides the investors therein with extensive information about its business, which is not generally available to the public. Because of the provision of confidential information, the unique and customised nature of the loan agreement relating to such Senior Obligation or Mezzanine Obligation, and the private syndication of the Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations are not as easily purchased or sold as a publicly traded security, and historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to, for example, the high yield bond market. Historically, investors in or lenders under European Senior Obligations and Mezzanine Obligations have been predominantly commercial banks and investment",p,
"banks. The range of investors for such loans has broadened significantly to include money managers, insurance companies, arbitrageurs, bankruptcy investors and mutual funds seeking increased potential total returns and collateral managers of trusts or special purpose companies issuing collateralised bond and loan obligations. As secondary market trading volumes increase, new loans are frequently adopting more standardised documentation to facilitate loan trading which should improve market liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future levels of supply and demand in loan trading will provide the degree of liquidity which currently exists in the market. This means that such assets will be subject to greater disposal risk if such assets are sold following enforcement of the security over the Collateral or otherwise. The European market for Mezzanine Obligations is also generally less liquid than that for Senior Obligations, resulting in increased disposal risk for such obligations.",p,
"Secured Senior Bonds are generally freely transferrable negotiable instruments (subject to standard selling and transfer restrictions to ensure compliance with applicable law, and subject to minimum denominations) and may be listed and admitted to trading on a regulated or an exchange regulated market; however there is currently no liquid market for them to any materially greater extent than there is for Senior Obligations which are loans. Additionally, as a consequence of the disclosure and transparency requirements associated with such listing, the information supplied by the Obligors to its debtholders may typically be less than would be provided on Senior Obligations which are loans.",p,
Increased Risks for Mezzanine Obligations,p,
"The fact that Mezzanine Obligations are generally subordinated to any Senior Obligations and potentially other indebtedness of the relevant Obligor thereunder, may have a longer maturity than such other indebtedness and will generally only have a second ranking security interest over any security granted in respect thereof, increases the risk of non-payment thereunder of such Mezzanine Obligations in an enforcement situation.",p,
"Mezzanine Obligations may provide that all or part of the interest accruing thereon will not be paid on a current basis but will be deferred. Mezzanine Obligations also generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations and Senior Obligations. They are often entered into in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the Obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated and, as referred to above, sit at a subordinated level in the capital structure of such companies.",p,
Investing in Cov-Lite Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Issuer or the Collateral Manager acting on its behalf may purchase Collateral Obligations which are Cov-Lite Loans. Cov-Lite Loans typically do not have maintenance covenants. Ownership of Cov-Lite Loans may expose the Issuer to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility and ability to restructure loans, than is the case with loans that have maintenance covenants. In addition, the lack of maintenance covenants may make it more difficult for lenders to trigger a default in respect of such obligations. This may make it more likely that any default arising under a Cov-Lite Loan will arise at a time when the relevant Obligor is in a greater degree of financial stress. Such a delay may make a successful restructuring more difficult to achieve and/or result in a greater reduction in the value of the Cov-Lite Loans as a consequence of any restructuring effected in such circumstances.",p,
Characteristics of High Yield Bonds,p,
"High Yield Bonds are generally unsecured, may be subordinated to other obligations of the applicable obligor and generally involve greater credit and liquidity risks than those associated with investment grade corporate obligations. They are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalisations in which the obligors thereunder incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they previously operated.",p,
"High Yield Bonds have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities. Although several studies have been made of historical default rates in the U.S. high yield market, such studies do not necessarily provide a basis for drawing definitive conclusions with respect to default rates and, in any event, do not necessarily provide a basis for predicting future default rates in either the European or the U.S. high yield markets which may exceed the hypothetical default rates assumed by",p,
investors in determining whether to purchase the Refinancing Notes or by the Rating Agencies in rating the Rated Notes.,p,
"The lower rating of securities in the high yield sector reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of an issuer thereof, or in general economic conditions (including a sustained period of rising interest rates or an economic downturn), or both, may affect the ability of such issuer to make payments of principal and interest on its debt. Many issuers of High Yield Bonds are highly leveraged, and specific developments affecting such issuers, including reduced cash flow from operations or inability to refinance debt at maturity, may also adversely affect such issuers’ ability to meet their debt service obligations. There can be no assurance as to the levels of defaults and/or recoveries that may be experienced on the High Yield Bonds in the Portfolio.",p,
"European High Yield Bonds are generally subordinated structurally, as opposed to contractually, to senior secured debtholders. Structural subordination is when a high yield security investor lends to a holding company whose primary asset is ownership of a cash- generating operating company or companies. The debt investment of the high yield investor is serviced by passing the revenues and tangible assets from the operating companies upstream through the holding company (which typically has no revenue- generating capacity of its own) to the security holders. In the absence of upstream guarantees from operating or asset owning companies in the group, such a process leaves the High Yield Bond investors deeply subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the operating companies and means that investors therein will not necessarily have access to the same security package as the senior lenders (even on a second priority charge basis) or be able to participate directly in insolvency proceedings or pre-insolvency discussions relating to the operating companies within the group. This facet of the European high yield market differs from the U.S. high yield market, where structural subordination is markedly less prevalent.",p,
"In the case of High Yield Bonds issued by issuers with their principal place of business in Europe, structural subordination of High Yield Bonds, coupled with the relatively shallow depth of the European high yield market, leads European high yield defaults to realise lower average recoveries than their U.S. counterparts. Another factor affecting recovery rates for European high yield bonds is the bankruptcy regimes applicable in different European jurisdictions and the enforceability of claims against the high yield bond issuer. See “Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations” below. It must be noted, however, that the overall probability of default (based on credit rating) remains similar for both",p,
U.S. and European credits; it is the severity of the effect of any default that differs between the two markets as a result of the aforementioned factors.,p,
"In addition to the characteristics described above, high yield securities frequently have call or redemption features that permit the issuer to redeem such obligations prior to their final maturity date. If such a call or redemption were exercised by an issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, may only be able to replace such called obligation with a lower yielding obligation, thus decreasing the net investment income from the Portfolio.",p,
Investing in Second Lien Loans involves certain risks,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Second Lien Loans, each of which will be secured by a collateral, but which is subordinated (with respect to liquidation preferences with respect to pledged collateral) to other secured obligations of the Obligors secured by all or a portion of the collateral securing such secured loan. Second Lien Loans are typically subject to intercreditor arrangements, the provisions of which may prohibit or restrict the ability of the holder of a Second Lien Loan to (i) exercise remedies against the collateral with respect to their second liens; (ii) challenge any exercise of remedies against the collateral by the first lien lenders with respect to their first liens; (iii) challenge the enforceability or priority of the first liens on the collateral; and (iv) exercise certain other secured creditor rights, both before and during a bankruptcy of the borrower. In addition, during a bankruptcy of the Obligor, the holder of a Second Lien Loan may be required to give advance consent to (a) any use of cash collateral approved by the first lien creditors; (b) sales of collateral approved by the first lien lenders and the bankruptcy court, so long as the second liens continue to attach to the sale proceeds; and (c) “debtor-in- possession” financings.",p,
Liens arising by operation of law may take priority over the Issuer’s liens on an Obligor’s underlying collateral and impair the Issuer’s recovery on a Collateral Obligation if a default or foreclosure on that Collateral Obligation occurs.,p,
"Liens on the collateral (if any) securing a Collateral Obligation may arise at law that have priority over the Issuer’s interest. An example of a lien arising under law is a tax or other government lien on property of an Obligor. A tax lien may have priority over the Issuer’s lien on such collateral. To the extent a lien having priority over the Issuer’s lien exists with respect to the collateral related to any Collateral Obligation, the Issuer’s interest in the asset will be subordinate to such lien. If the creditor holding such lien exercises its remedies, it is possible that, after such creditor is repaid, sufficient cash proceeds from the underlying collateral will not be available to pay the outstanding principal amount of such Collateral Obligation.",p,
Characteristics of Unsecured Senior Loans,p,
"The Collateral Obligations may include Unsecured Senior Loans. Such obligations generally have greater credit, insolvency and liquidity risk than is typically associated with secured obligations. Unsecured Senior Loans will generally have lower rates of recovery than secured obligations following a default. Also, if the insolvency of an Obligor of any Unsecured Senior Loans occurs, the holders of such obligation will be considered general, unsecured creditors of the Obligor and will have fewer rights than secured creditors of the Obligor.",p,
4.8 Corporate Rescue Loans,p,
"Corporate Rescue Loans are made to companies that have experienced, or are experiencing, significant financial or business difficulties such that they have become subject to bankruptcy or other reorganisation and liquidation proceedings and thus involves additional risks. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that the Issuer will correctly evaluate the value of the assets securing the Corporate Rescue Loan or the prospects for a successful reorganisation or similar action and accordingly the Issuer could suffer significant losses on its investments in such Corporate Rescue Loan. In any reorganisation or liquidation case relating to a company in which the Issuer invests, the Issuer may lose its entire investment, may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Issuer’s original investment and/or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time.",p,
"Distressed company and other asset-based investments require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation by the Issuer in business strategy or bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that the Issuer becomes involved in such proceedings, the Issuer’s more active participation in the affairs of the bankruptcy debtor could result in the imposition of restrictions limiting the Issuer’s ability to liquidate its position in the debtor.",p,
"Although a Corporate Rescue Loan is secured, where the Obligor is subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, it has a priority permitted by Section 364(c) or section 364(d) under the United States Bankruptcy Code and at the time that it is acquired by the Issuer is required to be current with respect to scheduled payments of interest (if any). This will not typically be the case for Obligors who are not subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings.",p,
4.9 Collateral Enhancement Obligations,p,
"All funds required in respect of the purchase price of any Collateral Enhancement Obligations and all funds required in respect of the exercise price of any rights or options thereunder, may only be paid out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account at the relevant time. Such Balance shall be comprised of all sums deposited therein from time to time which will comprise interest payable in respect of the Subordinated Notes which the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, determines shall be paid into the Supplemental Reserve Account pursuant to the Priorities of Payment rather than being paid to the Subordinated Noteholders. The aggregate amount which may be credited to the Supplemental Reserve Account in accordance with the Priorities of Payment are subject to the following caps: (i) in aggregate on any particular Payment Date, such amount may not exceed €3,000,000 and (ii) the cumulative maximum aggregate total in respect of all Payment Dates may not exceed",p,
"€ 9,000,000.00",p,
The Collateral Manager is under no obligation whatsoever to exercise its discretion (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to take any of the actions described above and there can be no assurance that the Balance standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account will be sufficient to fund the exercise of any,p,
"right or option under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation at any time. The ability of the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to exercise any rights or options under any Collateral Enhancement Obligation will be dependent upon there being sufficient amounts standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account to pay the costs of any such exercise. Failure to exercise any such right or option may result in a reduction of the returns to the Subordinated Noteholders (and, potentially, Noteholders of other Classes).",p,
"Collateral Enhancement Obligations and any income or return generated thereby are not taken into account for the purposes of determining satisfaction of, or required to satisfy, any of the Coverage Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests or the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test.",p,
"To the extent that there are insufficient sums standing to the credit of the Supplemental Reserve Account from time to time to purchase or exercise rights under Collateral Enhancement Obligations which the Collateral Manager determines on behalf of the Issuer should be purchased or exercised, the Collateral Manager may, at its discretion, on no more than three separate occasions and subject to a minimum payment of €1,000,000 on each such occasion, pay amounts required in order to fund such purchase or exercise (such amount, a “Collateral Manager Advance”) to such account pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. All such Collateral Manager Advances shall be repaid (together with interest thereon) out of the Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date pursuant to the Priorities of Payment.",p,
4.10 Limited Control of Administration and Amendment of Collateral Obligations,p,
"As a holder of an interest in a syndicated loan, the Issuer will have limited consent and control rights and such rights may not be effective in view of the expected proportion of such obligations held by the Issuer. The Collateral Manager will exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of the Issuer’s rights in connection with the Collateral Obligations or any related documents or will refuse amendments or waivers of the terms of any underlying asset and related documents in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. The Noteholders will not have any right to compel the Collateral Manager to take or refrain from taking any actions other than in accordance with its portfolio management practices and the standard of care specified in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may, in accordance with its portfolio management practices and subject to the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, agree on behalf of the Issuer to extend or defer the maturity, or adjust the outstanding balance of any underlying asset, or otherwise amend, modify or waive the terms of any related loan agreement, including the payment terms thereunder. Any amendment, waiver or modification of an underlying asset could postpone the expected maturity of the Notes and/or reduce the likelihood of timely and complete payment of interest on or principal of the Notes.",p,
"In addition, Participations may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation and may also be subject to the QFC Stay Rules. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above.",p,
Additional risks are therefore associated with the purchase of Participations by the Issuer as opposed to Assignments. The Portfolio Profile Tests including the Bivariate Risk Table impose limits on the amount of Collateral Obligations that may comprise Participations as a proportion of the Collateral Principal Amount.,p,
4.12 Voting Restrictions on Syndicated Loans for Minority Holders,p,
"The Issuer will generally purchase each underlying asset in the form of an assignment of, or participation interest in, a note or other obligation issued under a loan facility to which more than one lender is a party. These loan facilities are administered for the lenders by a lender or other agent acting as the lead administrator. The terms and conditions of these loan facilities may be amended, modified or waived only by the agreement of the lenders. Generally, any such agreement requires the consent of a majority or a super-majority (measured by outstanding loans or commitments) or, in certain circumstances, a unanimous vote of the lenders, and the Issuer may have a minority interest in such loan facilities. Consequently, the terms and conditions of an underlying asset issued or sold in connection with a loan facility could be modified, amended or waived in a manner contrary to the preferences of the Issuer if the amendment, modification or waiver of such term or condition does not require the unanimous vote of the lenders and a sufficient number of the other lenders concur with such modification, amendment or waiver. There can be no assurance that any Collateral Obligations issued or sold in connection with any loan facility will maintain the terms and conditions to which the Issuer or a predecessor in interest to the Issuer originally agreed.",p,
4.13 Counterparty Risk,p,
"Assignments, Participations and Hedge Transactions involve the Issuer entering into contracts with counterparties. Pursuant to such contracts, the counterparties agree to make payments to the Issuer under certain circumstances as described therein. The Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty with respect of any such payments. Counterparties in respect of Participations and Hedge Transactions are required to satisfy the applicable Rating Requirement, upon entry into the applicable contract or instrument.",p,
"If a Hedge Counterparty is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, there will be a termination event under the applicable Hedge Agreement unless, within the applicable grace period following such rating withdrawal or downgrade, such Hedge Counterparty either transfers its obligations under the applicable Hedge Agreement to a replacement counterparty with the requisite ratings, obtains a guarantee of its obligations by a guarantor with the requisite ratings, collateralises its obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Rating Agencies or employs some other such strategy as may be approved by the Rating Agencies. There can be no assurance that the applicable Hedge Counterparty will be able to transfer its obligations to a suitable replacement counterparty or exercise any of the other aforementioned remedies within the specified remedy period. Failure to do so may result in interest rate or currency mismatches, which could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes as the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure or currency risk exposure in respect of Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Hedge Transaction (see “Interest Rate Risk” and “Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions – Currency Risk” below). For further information, see “Hedging Arrangements” below.",p,
"Similarly, the Issuer will be exposed to the credit risk of the Account Bank and the Custodian to the extent of, respectively, all cash of the Issuer held in the Accounts and all Collateral of the Issuer held by the Custodian. If the Account Bank or the Custodian is subject to a rating withdrawal or downgrade by the Rating Agencies to below the applicable Rating Requirement, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the appointment of a replacement Account Bank or Custodian, as the case may be, with the applicable Rating Requirement and within the time limits prescribed for such action in the applicable Transaction Documents.",p,
Transactions with counterparties that are relevant institutions for the purposes of the BRRD may be subject to the exercise of the “bail-in” powers attributed to Resolution Authorities under the BRRD or similar resolution mechanisms provided for in the SRM Regulation. See “EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive” and “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts” above. Transactions with counterparties that are Covered Entities for the purposes of the QFC Stay Rules may also be subject to the limitations in such rules. See “U.S. Stay Rules Relating to Qualified Financial Contracts”.,p,
4.14 Concentration Risk,p,
"Although no significant concentration with respect to any particular Obligor, industry or country is expected to exist at the Effective Date, the concentration of the Portfolio in any one Obligor would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to defaults by such Obligor, and the concentration of the Portfolio in any one industry would subject the Notes to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to such industry. The Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests attempt to mitigate any concentration risk in the Portfolio. See “The Portfolio - Portfolio Profile Tests and Collateral Quality Tests”.",p,
4.15 Credit Risk,p,
Risks applicable to Collateral Obligations also include the possibility that earnings of the Obligor may be insufficient to meet its debt service obligations thereunder and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the Obligor of such Collateral Obligations during period of rising interest rates and economic downturn. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for leveraged loans and adversely affect the value thereof and the ability of the Obligor thereunder to repay principal and interest.,p,
4.16 Interest Rate Risk,p,
"In addition, any payments of principal or interest received in respect of Collateral Obligations and not otherwise reinvested during the Reinvestment Period in Substitute Collateral Obligations will generally be invested in Eligible Investments until shortly before the next Payment Date. There is no requirement that such Eligible Investments bear interest on a particular basis, and the interest rates available for such Eligible Investments are inherently uncertain. As a result of these factors, it is expected that there will be a fixed/floating rate mismatch and/or a floating rate basis mismatch between the Notes and the underlying Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments. Such mismatch may be material and may change from time to time as the composition of the related Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments change and as the liabilities of the Issuer accrue or are repaid. As a result of such mismatches, changes in the level of EURIBOR could adversely affect the ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager, acting on behalf of the Issuer, is authorised to enter into Interest Rate Hedge Transactions in order to mitigate such interest rate mismatch from time to time, subject to receipt in each case of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (other than in the case of a Form Approved Hedge) and subject to certain regulatory considerations in relation to swaps, discussed in “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above. However, the Issuer will depend on each Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any Interest Rate Hedge Transaction to which it is a party and if any Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from such Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty to cover its interest rate risk exposure. Any termination in the case of an Interest Rate Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to interest rate risk mismatch for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Interest Rate Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Interest Rate Hedge Counterparty.",p,
"In addition, some Collateral Obligations permit the Obligor to re-set the interest period applicable to it from quarterly to semi-annual and vice versa. Interest Amounts are due and payable in respect of the Notes on a semi-annual basis following a Frequency Switch Event and on a quarterly basis at all other times. If a significant number of Collateral Obligations re-set to semi-annual interest payments there may be insufficient interest received to make quarterly interest payments on the Notes. In order to mitigate the effects of any timing mis-match, the Issuer will hold back a portion of the interest received on Collateral Obligations which pay interest less frequently than quarterly in order to make quarterly payments of interest on the Notes (“Interest Smoothing”). In addition, to mitigate re-set risk, a Frequency Switch Event shall occur if (amongst other things) a sufficient portion of the Collateral Obligations re-set from quarterly to semi-annual pay, as more particularly described in the definition of “Frequency Switch Event”. There can be no assurance that Interest Smoothing and the occurrence of a Frequency Switch Event shall be sufficient to mitigate any timing and re-set mismatches.",p,
There can be no assurance that the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments securing the Notes will in all circumstances generate sufficient Interest Proceeds to make timely payments of interest on the Notes or that any particular levels of return will be generated on the Subordinated Notes.,p,
"On 5 June 2014, the European Central Bank announced that it would charge a negative rate of interest on bank deposits with the European Central Bank. To the extent the European Central Bank’s or other central bank’s deposit rate from time to time results in the Account Bank or the Custodian incurring negative deposit rates as a result of maintaining any accounts on the Issuer’s behalf, the Issuer will be required to reimburse the Account Bank or the Custodian, as applicable, in an amount equal to the chargeable interest incurred on such accounts as a result of such negative deposit rates. Prospective investors should note that given recent levels of, and moves in respect of, deposit rates, it appears likely the Issuer will be required to make such payments in reimbursement of the Account Bank and the Custodian. Any such payments shall be paid as Administrative Expenses, subject to and in accordance",p,
"with the Priorities of Payment and may, accordingly, have a negative impact on the amounts available to the Issuer to apply as payments on the Notes.",p,
4.17 Non-Euro Obligations and Currency Hedge Transactions,p,
Currency Risk,p,
The Portfolio Profile Tests provide that up to 25 per cent. of the Collateral Principal Amount may comprise Currency Hedge Obligations. The percentage of the Portfolio that is comprised of these types of obligations may increase or decrease over the life of the Notes within the limit set by the Portfolio Profile Tests. The Issuer is required to enter into a Currency Hedge Transaction in respect of each Non- Euro Obligation.,p,
"Notwithstanding that Non-Euro Obligations are required to be subject to Currency Hedge Transactions, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for currencies in which Collateral Obligations are denominated may lead to the proceeds of the Portfolio being insufficient to pay all amounts due to the respective Classes of Noteholders. In addition, fluctuations in euro exchange rates may result in a decrease in value of the Portfolio for the purposes of sale thereof (including but not limited to a Non- Euro Obligation upon enforcement of the security over it). Any termination in the case of a Currency Hedge Transaction would result in the Issuer being exposed to currency risk in respect of the related Non-Euro Obligations for so long as the Issuer has not entered into a replacement Currency Hedge Transaction and may result in the Issuer being required to pay a termination amount to the relevant Currency Hedge Counterparty. The Collateral Manager may also be limited at the time of investment in its choice of Collateral Obligations because of the cost of entry into such Currency Hedge Transactions and due to restrictions in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement with respect thereto. The Collateral Manager may also be unable to find suitable Currency Hedge Counterparties willing to provide Currency Hedge Transactions. There are also currently a number of regulatory initiatives which may make it difficult or impossible for the Issuer to enter into Currency Hedge Transactions or Interest Rate Hedge Transactions. “European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)”, “Prudential Regulations” and “Commodity Pool Regulation” above.",p,
The Issuer’s ongoing payment obligations under such Currency Hedge Transactions (including termination payments) may be significant. The payments associated with such hedging arrangements generally rank senior to payments on the Notes.,p,
"Defaults, prepayments, trading and other events may increase the risk of a mismatch between the foreign exchange hedges and Collateral Obligations. This may cause losses.",p,
"The Issuer will depend upon the Currency Hedge Counterparty to perform its obligations under any hedges. If the Currency Hedge Counterparty defaults or becomes unable to perform due to insolvency or otherwise, the Issuer may not receive payments it would otherwise be entitled to from the Currency Hedge Counterparty to cover its foreign exchange exposure.",p,
4.18 Reinvestment Risk/Uninvested Cash Balances,p,
"To the extent the Collateral Manager maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher yielding loans or bonds, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for payment on the Notes. In general, the larger the amount and the longer the time period during which cash balances remain uninvested the greater the adverse impact on portfolio income which will reduce amounts available for payment on the Notes, especially the Subordinated Notes. The extent to which cash balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult to predict.",p,
"During the Reinvestment Period, subject to compliance with certain criteria and limitations described herein, the Collateral Manager will have discretion to dispose of certain Collateral Obligations on behalf of the Issuer and to reinvest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations in compliance with the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, during the Reinvestment Period, to the extent that any Collateral Obligations prepay or mature prior to the Maturity Date, the Collateral Manager will seek, to invest the proceeds thereof in Substitute Collateral Obligations, subject to the Reinvestment Criteria. In addition, following the expiry of the Reinvestment Period, the Collateral Manager may reinvest some types of Principal Proceeds on behalf of the Issuer (see “The Collateral Manager May Reinvest After the End of",p,
"the Reinvestment Period” above). The yield with respect to such Substitute Collateral Obligations will depend, among other factors, on reinvestment rates available at the time, on the availability of investments which satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria and are acceptable to the Collateral Manager, and on market conditions related to high yield securities and bank loans in general. The need to satisfy such Reinvestment Criteria and identify acceptable investments may require the purchase of Collateral Obligations with a lower yield than those replaced, with different characteristics than those replaced (including, but not limited to, coupon, maturity, call features and/or credit quality) or require that such funds be maintained in cash or Eligible Investments pending reinvestment in Substitute Collateral Obligations, which will further reduce the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount. Any decrease in the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount will have the effect of reducing the amounts available to make distributions of interest on the Notes which will adversely affect cash flows available to make payments on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. There can be no assurance that in the event Collateral Obligations are sold, prepaid, or mature, yields on Collateral Obligations that are eligible for purchase will be at the same levels as those replaced and there can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Substitute Collateral Obligations purchased will be the same as those replaced and there can be no assurance as to the timing of the purchase of any Substitute Collateral Obligations.",p,
"The timing of the initial investment of the net proceeds of issue of the Refinancing Notes remaining after the payment of certain fees and expenses due and payable by the Issuer and the redemption of the Refinanced Notes on the Issue Date as further described herein and reinvestment of Sale Proceeds, Scheduled Principal Proceeds and Unscheduled Principal Proceeds, can affect the return to holders of and cash flows available to make payments on, the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes. Loans and privately placed high yield securities are not as easily (or as quickly) purchased or sold as publicly traded securities for a variety of reasons, including confidentiality requirements with respect to Obligor information, the customised nature of loan agreements and private syndication. The reduced liquidity and lower volume of trading in loans, in addition to restrictions on investment represented by the Reinvestment Criteria, could result in periods of time during which the Issuer is not able to fully invest its cash in Collateral Obligations. The longer the period between reinvestment of cash in Collateral Obligations, the greater the adverse impact may be on the aggregate amount of the Interest Proceeds collected and distributed by the Issuer, including on the Notes, especially the most junior Class or Classes of Notes, thereby resulting in lower yields than could have been obtained if Principal Proceeds were immediately reinvested. In addition, loans are often prepayable by the borrowers thereof with no, or limited, penalty or premium. As a result, loans generally prepay more frequently than other corporate debt obligations of the issuers thereof. Senior loans usually have shorter terms than more junior obligations and often require mandatory repayments from excess cash flow, asset dispositions and offerings of debt and/or equity securities. The increased levels of prepayments and amortisation of loans increase the associated reinvestment risk on the Collateral Obligations which risk will first be borne by holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, the amount of Collateral Obligations owned by the Issuer on the Issue Date, the timing of purchases of additional Collateral Obligations on and after the Issue Date and the scheduled interest payment dates of those Collateral Obligations may have a material impact on collections of Interest Proceeds during the first Due Period, which could affect interest payments on the Rated Notes and the payment of distributions to the Subordinated Notes on the first Payment Date.",p,
4.19 Ratings on Collateral Obligations,p,
"addition, some ratings will be derived by the Collateral Manager based on, among other things, Obligor group or affiliate ratings, comparable ratings provided by a different rating agency and, in certain circumstances, temporary ratings applied by the Collateral Manager. The Portfolio Profile Tests contain limitations on the proportions of the Collateral Principal Amount that may be made up of Collateral Obligations where the S&P Rating or Moody’s Rating is derived from the rating of another rating agency. Furthermore, such derived ratings will not reflect detailed credit analysis of the particular Collateral Obligation and may reflect a more or less conservative view of the actual credit risk of such Collateral Obligation than any such fundamental credit analysis might, if conducted, warrant; and model-derived variations in such ratings may occur (and have consequential effects on the Collateral Quality Tests, the Portfolio Profile Tests and the Coverage Tests) without necessarily reflecting comparable variation in the actual credit quality of the Collateral Obligation in question. See “Ratings of the Notes” and “The Portfolio”.",p,
"There can be no assurance that rating agencies will continue to assign such ratings utilising the same methods and standards utilised today despite the fact that such Collateral Obligation might still be performing fully to the specifications set forth in its Underlying Instrument. Any change in such methods and standards could result in a significant rise in the number of CCC Obligations and Caa Obligations or Defaulted Obligations in the Portfolio, which could cause the Issuer to fail to satisfy (i) the Par Value/Coverage Tests on subsequent Determination Dates, which failure could lead to the early amortisation of some or all of one or more Classes of the Notes or restrict the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf from reinvesting in substitute Collateral Obligations (see Condition 7(c) (Mandatory Redemption upon Breach of Coverage Tests)) or (ii) the Reinvestment Overcollateralisation Test, which failure could cause a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Subordinated Noteholders.",p,
4.20 Insolvency Considerations relating to Collateral Obligations,p,
"Collateral Obligations may be subject to various laws enacted for the protection of creditors in the countries of the jurisdictions of incorporation of Obligors and, if different, in which the Obligors conduct business and in which they hold the assets, which may adversely affect such Obligors’ abilities to make payment on a full or timely basis. These insolvency considerations will differ depending on the country in which each Obligor is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the Obligor is a non- sovereign or a sovereign entity. In particular, it should be noted that a number of continental European jurisdictions operate “debtor friendly” insolvency regimes which would result in delays in payments under Collateral Obligations where obligations thereunder are subject to such regimes, in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Obligor.",p,
The different insolvency regimes applicable in the different European jurisdictions result in a corresponding variability of recovery rates for different types of Collateral Obligations entered into by Obligors in such jurisdictions. No reliable historical data is available.,p,
4.21 Lender Liability Considerations; Equitable Subordination,p,
"In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States and other jurisdictions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders or bondholders on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively, termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender or bondholder has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or issuer or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or issuer resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or issuer or its other creditors or shareholders. Although it would be a novel application of the lender liability theories, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender liability. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to any, conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon lender liability.",p,
"In addition, under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (a) intentionally takes an action that results in the under capitalisation of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (b) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (c) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (d) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court may elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called “equitable",p,
"subordination”. Because of the nature of the Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to claims from creditors of an Obligor that Collateral Obligations issued by such Obligor that are held by the Issuer should be equitably subordinated. However, the Issuer does not intend to engage in, and the Collateral Manager does not intend to advise the Issuer with respect to, any conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon the equitable subordination doctrine.",p,
"The preceding discussion is based upon principles of United States federal and state laws. Insofar as Collateral Obligations that are obligations of non-United States Obligors are concerned, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions may impose liability upon lenders or bondholders under factual circumstances similar to those described above, with consequences that may or may not be analogous to those described above under United States federal and state laws.",p,
4.22 Loan Repricing,p,
"Leveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings, and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalised or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collection on the Collateral Obligations, which would have an adverse effect on the amount available for distributions on Notes, beginning with the subordinated Notes as the most junior Classes.",p,
"At the time when they are acquired by the Issuer, Eligibility Criteria require that payments of interest on the Collateral Obligations either will not be reduced by any withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction or, if and to the extent that any such withholding tax does apply, either (i) such withholding tax can be sheltered by application being made under the applicable double tax treaty; (ii) such withholding tax is a",p,
"U.S. federal withholding tax imposed on letter of credit fees, consent fees, commitment fees or similar fees; or (iii) the Obligor is required to make “gross-up” payments to the Issuer that cover the full amount of any such withholding on an after-tax basis. However, there can be no assurance that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof, the payments on the Collateral Obligations might not in the future become subject to withholding tax or increased withholding rates in respect of which the relevant Obligor will not be obliged to make gross up payments to the Issuer. In such circumstances, the Issuer may be able, but will not be obliged, to take advantage of (a) a double taxation treaty between The Netherlands and the jurisdiction from which the relevant payment is made,",p,
"(b) the current applicable law in the jurisdiction of the borrower or (c) the fact that the Issuer has taken a Participation in such Collateral Obligations from a Selling Institution which is able to pay interest payable under such Participation gross. In the event that the Issuer receives any interest payments on any Collateral Obligation net of any applicable withholding tax, the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests will be determined by reference to such net receipts. Such tax would also reduce the amounts available to make payments on the Notes. There can be no assurance that remaining payments on the Collateral Obligations would be sufficient to make timely payments of interest and principal on the Notes of each Class and the other amounts payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date. If payments in respect of Collateral Obligations to the Issuer become subject to withholding tax, this may also trigger a Collateral Tax Event and result in an optional redemption of the Rated Notes in accordance with Condition 7(b)(i)(B) (Optional Redemption in Whole—Subordinated Noteholders).",p,
4.24 UK Taxation of the Issuer,p,
The Issuer will not be treated as being tax resident in the UK provided that the central management and control of the Issuer is not in the UK. The Managing Directors intend to conduct the affairs of the Issuer in such a manner so that it does not become resident in the UK for taxation purposes.,p,
"The Issuer will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK if it has a fixed place of business in the UK or it has an agent in the UK who has and habitually exercises authority in the UK to do business on the Issuer’s behalf. The Issuer does not intend to have a fixed place of business in the UK. The Collateral Manager will, however, have and is expected to exercise authority to do business on behalf of the Issuer.",p,
The Issuer should not be subject to UK corporation tax in consequence of the activities which the Collateral Manager carries out on its behalf provided that the Issuer’s activities are regarded as investment activities rather than trading activities.,p,
"Should the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) be assessed to UK tax on behalf of the Issuer, it may be entitled to an indemnity from the Issuer. Any payment to be made by the Issuer under this indemnity will be paid as Administrative Expenses of the Issuer. Administrative Expenses are payable by the Issuer on any Payment Date under the Priorities of Payment. It should be noted that UK tax legislation makes it possible for H.M. Revenue & Customs to seek to assess the Issuer to UK tax directly rather than through the Collateral Manager (or its members, delegates (including Ares Management Limited) or its Affiliates) as its UK representative. Should the Issuer be assessed on this basis, the Issuer will be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profit attributable to its UK activities, such payment to be made subject to and in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. The Issuer would also be liable to pay UK tax on its UK taxable profits in the unlikely event that it were treated as being tax resident in the UK, such payment to be made in accordance with the Priorities of Payment. Imposition of such tax by the United Kingdom tax authorities may also give rise to a Note Tax Event pursuant to which the Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at the direction of the holders of each of the Controlling Class or the Subordinated Notes, in each case acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, subject to certain conditions including a threshold test pursuant to which determination is made as to whether the anticipated proceeds of liquidation of the security over the Collateral would be sufficient to pay all amounts due and payable on the Rated Notes in such circumstances in accordance with the Priorities of Payment.",p,
"The Issuer will also be chargeable to UK corporation tax, regardless of whether it is deemed to be resident or to have a permanent establishment in the UK, if (a) it is carrying on a ""trade of dealing in or developing UK land"", (b) it disposes of ""interests in UK land"" or certain assets other than ""interests in UK land"" which derive at least 75 per cent. of their value from UK land where the Issuer has a ""substantial indirect interest"" in that land, or (c) with effect from 6th April 2020 it carries on a ""UK property business"" or has other ""UK property income"". However, it is not expected that, by virtue of investing in Collateral Obligations (and other financial assets), the Issuer will fall within any of these potential heads of charge.",p,
4.25 Diverted Profits Tax,p,
"The Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax in the United Kingdom called the “diverted profits tax” which is charged at 25 per cent. of any “taxable diverted profits”. The tax has effect from 1 April 2015 and may apply in circumstances including where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-UK resident company does not carry on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, the non-resident company supplies goods, services or other property in the course of that non-resident",p,
company’s trade and it is reasonable to assume that arrangements are in place the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to avoid United Kingdom corporation tax.,p,
The basis upon which HM Revenue & Customs will apply the diverted profits tax in practice remains uncertain although it should be noted that there are specific exemptions for United Kingdom investment managers who enter into transactions on behalf of certain overseas persons and in respect of which the Investment Manager Exemption would apply and a general exemption where the activities of the non- UK resident company in the United Kingdom are carried out by an agent of independent status which is not connected to such non-UK resident company.,p,
4.26 Collateral Manager,p,
"The Collateral Manager, is given authority in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement to act as Collateral Manager to the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio pursuant to and in accordance with the parameters and criteria set out in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. See “The Portfolio” and “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. While the Collateral Manager will be responsible for the collateral management and credit decisions with respect to managing the Collateral on behalf of the Issuer, certain day-to-day discretions relating to the composition of the portfolios of the Issuer as well as authority to execute transactions for the Issuer will be delegated to Ares Management Limited (“AML”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”). In addition, AML will: (i) perform certain middle- and back-office functions for the Collateral Manager; (ii) make available certain individuals to perform certain functions for the Collateral Manager; and (iii) provide the Collateral Manager with certain intellectual property licences. The Collateral Manager procures these services pursuant to a services agreement with AML.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement places significant restrictions on the Collateral Manager’s ability to buy and sell Collateral Obligations. Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain specified circumstances, the Collateral Manager may be unable to buy or sell Collateral Obligations or to take other actions which it might consider in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders, as a result of such restrictions.",p,
"The actual performance of the Issuer will depend on numerous factors which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Collateral Manager. The nature of and risks associated with, the Issuer’s future investments may differ substantially from those investments and strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager and such persons. There can be no assurance that the Issuer’s investments will perform as well as the past investments of any such persons or entities.",p,
"The performance of other collateralised debt obligation vehicles (“CLO Vehicles”) or other similar investment funds (“Other Funds”) managed or advised by the Collateral Manager or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager (including AML) should not be relied upon as an indication or prediction of the performance of the Issuer. Such other CLO Vehicles and Other Funds may have significantly different characteristics, including but not limited to their structures, composition of the collateral pool, investment objectives, leverage, financing costs, fees and expenses, management personnel and other terms when compared to the Issuer and may have been formed and managed under significantly different market conditions than those which apply to the Issuer and its Portfolio.",p,
"In addition, the Collateral Manager may resign or be removed in certain circumstances as described herein under “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. There can be no assurance that any successor collateral manager would have the same level of skill in performing the obligations of the Collateral Manager, in which event payments on the Notes could be reduced or delayed.",p,
The Collateral Manager is not required to devote all of its time to the performance of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and will continue to advise and manage other investment funds in the future.,p,
"The Collateral Manager’s information and technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorised persons and security breaches, usage errors by their respective professionals, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. Although the Collateral Manager may have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, the failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in the Collateral Manager’s operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy or sensitive data. Such a failure could impede the ability of the Collateral Manager to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents.",p,
"The Issuer has entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement with the Collateral Manager and Barclays Bank PLC. Under the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement (i) the Collateral Manager will select certain Collateral Obligations in the primary and/or secondary markets to be purchased by Barclays Bank PLC, (ii) Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to sell to the Issuer, with full title guarantee, all of its rights, title, interest, obligations and benefit in and to each such Collateral Obligation on the Issue Date and (iii) the Issuer has undertaken to purchase from Barclays Bank PLC such Collateral Obligations on the Issue Date.",p,
"The Initial Purchaser takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer and no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer. If the Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates owns Notes, they will have no responsibility to consider the interests of any other owner of Notes with respect to actions they take or refrain from taking in such capacity.",p,
4.28 Acquisition and Disposition of Collateral Obligations,p,
"Under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and as described herein, the Collateral Manager may only, on behalf of the Issuer, dispose of a limited percentage of Collateral Obligations in any period of 12 calendar months as well as any Collateral Obligation that meets the definition of a Defaulted Obligation, an Exchanged Security and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a Credit Risk Obligation or Credit Improved Obligation. Notwithstanding such restrictions and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, sales and purchases by the Collateral Manager of Collateral Obligations could result in losses by the Issuer, which will be borne in the first instance by the holders of the Subordinated Notes and then by holders of the Rated Notes, beginning with the most junior Class.",p,
"In addition, circumstances may exist under which the Collateral Manager may believe that it is in the best interests of the Issuer to dispose of a Collateral Obligation, but will not be permitted to do so under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.",p,
4.29 Valuation Information; Limited Information,p,
"None of the Sole Arranger, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Manager or any other transaction party will be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and none of the transaction parties (including the Issuer, Trustee and Collateral Manager) will be required to provide any information other than what is required in the Trust Deed or the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. Furthermore, if any information is provided to the Noteholders (including required reports under the Trust Deed), such information may not be audited. Finally, the Collateral Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will not be required to disclose such information to the Noteholders.",p,
5. CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,p,
"The Initial Purchaser and the Collateral Manager, are acting in a number of capacities in connection with the transaction described herein, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. The following briefly summarises some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates,p,
"The scope of the activities of the Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited and the funds and clients managed or advised by Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited may give rise to conflicts of interest or other restrictions and/or limitations imposed on the Issuer in the future that cannot be foreseen or mitigated at this time. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall investment activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may invest, on behalf of themselves and their clients, in obligations and/or securities that would be appropriate as Collateral Obligations, as well as in obligations and/or securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations that are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may give advice or take action for their own account or their other client accounts with similar strategies which may differ from action taken for the Issuer. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also have ongoing relationships with companies whose obligations and/or securities are Collateral Obligations, and may own, directly or through other funds or accounts that they manage, loans, equity or debt securities issued by obligors of Collateral Obligations or other Collateral. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may have provided and may provide in the future certain services (including advisory services) for a negotiated fee to companies whose obligations or other securities are assigned or charged as Collateral to secure the Notes. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, their Affiliates and their respective clients and personnel may invest, or have already invested, in obligations and/or other securities that are identical to or senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the Collateral Obligations. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, on behalf of themselves or their clients, may also be active on steering committees of creditors in the restructuring of debt obligations issued by companies whose loans or securities are owned by them or their clients, including the Issuer, which relationships could give rise to multiple conflicts of interest. In addition, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may serve as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager of partnerships or companies organised to issue collateralised bond or loan obligations secured by noninvestment grade bank loans. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates may at certain times be engaged in seeking to purchase or dispose of, or may have already purchased or disposed of, investments for the Issuer while at the same time the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and/or their Affiliates is also seeking to purchase or dispose of, or has already purchased or disposed of, similar or identical investments for its own account or clients or Affiliates or another entity for which it or an Affiliate serves as a general partner, managing member, adviser, officer, director, sponsor or manager. By reason of the various activities of the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and such Affiliates may acquire or otherwise come into possession of confidential or material non-public information or be restricted from effecting transactions in certain Collateral Obligations or other Collateral that otherwise might have been initiated or prevented from liquidating a position. Such information might also not be known to the personnel of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited responsible for monitoring the Collateral Obligations or other Collateral and performing the other obligations of the Collateral Manager under the Collateral",p,
"Management and Administration Agreement. At times, the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited, in an effort to avoid restrictions for the Issuer and its and its Affiliates’ other clients, may elect not to receive, or actively avoid exposure to, information that other market participants or counterparties are eligible to receive or have received.",p,
"Many of the investment opportunities that Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited evaluate for potential investment by their clients or funds may be eligible investments for more than one such client or fund. Ares Management LLC (“Ares Management”) and its Affiliates expect to allocate such investment opportunities generally based on factors and other considerations as Ares Management determines in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to: (i) differences with respect to available capital, size, and remaining life of a fund; (ii) different investment objectives or strategies;",p,
"(iii) differences in risk profile at the time the opportunity becomes available; (iv) the potential transaction and other costs of allocating an opportunity among various funds; (v) potential conflicts of interest, including whether a fund has an existing investment in the issuer in question; (vi) the nature of the security or the transaction including minimum investment amounts and the source of the opportunity;",p,
"(vii) current and anticipated market conditions; and (viii) differences in particular portfolio profile covenants or other contractual requirements, including requirements set forth in debt agreements of funds utilising leverage.",p,
"Neither the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited nor any of their Affiliates have any affirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before offering any investments to other funds, accounts or portfolios (including, without limitation, any collateralised loan obligation transaction) that the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited or any of their Affiliates manage or advise. The Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may also make investments on their own behalf without effecting such investment opportunities on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may be bound by affirmative obligations at present or in the future, whereby it or they are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise before or without the Collateral Manager Ares Management Limited or their Affiliates effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Alternatively, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and their Affiliates may offer certain investments to funds or accounts that it or they manage or advise simultaneously with or in addition to effecting those investments on behalf of the Issuer. Thus, other funds, accounts or portfolios that it or they manage or advise could become co-investors with the Issuer.",p,
"The Collateral Manager will endeavour to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities in a manner which it deems equitable to the extent possible under the prevailing facts and circumstances. Further, the Collateral Manager will be prohibited under the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement from directing the acquisition of Collateral Obligations from, or disposition of Collateral Obligations to, its Affiliates or any other account managed by the Collateral Manager except in a transaction conducted on an arm’s-length basis.",p,
"Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited currently serve as the portfolio managers for a number of collateralised loan obligation transactions secured by collateral consisting primarily of non-investment grade secured bank loans. The professional staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may also provide services to such Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited. Although the professional staff of the Collateral Manager and AML will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited deem appropriate to perform its duties in accordance with the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the staff of the Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among the Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s (and Ares Management Limited’s) other accounts and the accounts of the Collateral Manager’s Affiliates. The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, aggregate orders for its accounts under management (or for the accounts of its Affiliates). Depending upon market conditions, the aggregation of orders may result in a higher or lower average price paid or received by a client. There is no assurance that the Issuer will hold the same assets as, or perform in a similar manner to, any other collateralised loan obligation or other client with strategies or investment objectives similar to the Issuer.",p,
"The Collateral Manager and Ares Management Limited may, in one or more transactions, effect client cross-transactions where the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited causes a transaction to be effected between the Issuer and another collateralised loan obligation, fund or account managed or advised by it or one or more of its Affiliates, but neither it nor the Affiliate will receive any commission",p,
"or similar fee in connection with such cross-transaction. In connection with any such acquisition or sale, the Collateral Obligations will be valued and bought or sold for a price based on a price that is equal to the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. Each of the acquisitions or sales described in this paragraph will be effected in accordance with, as applicable, the terms of the Trust Deed, the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and applicable law, including, without limitation, the applicable provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”) that govern such transactions.",p,
"Any transaction effected between the Issuer and the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates on a principal, client cross or agency cross basis will be conducted at arm’s length for fair market value and on terms as favourable to the Issuer as would be the case in a transaction with an independent third party and in accordance with any fiduciary obligation of the Collateral Manager under applicable law.",p,
"On each Payment Date, the Collateral Manager will be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priorities of Payment if the Subordinated Noteholders have received the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold as of such Payment Date. See “Description of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement”. The manner in which the Incentive Collateral Management Fee is determined could create an incentive for the Collateral Manager to make riskier investments in the Collateral Obligations than the Issuer would otherwise make in order to increase the likelihood that the Subordinated Noteholders receive the Incentive Collateral Management Fee IRR Threshold for the Collateral Manager to be paid the Incentive Collateral Management Fee.",p,
"The Collateral Manager may enter into, amend or terminate side letters or other similar agreements to or with one or more Noteholders or prospective Noteholders which have the effect of altering or supplementing terms described in this Offering Circular as they pertain to the Collateral Manager or of establishing rights not described therein with respect to a Noteholder that has entered into such side letters or other written agreements or instruments vis à vis the Collateral Manager, including, without limitation, varying fee structures and allowing for varying arrangements with respect to the scope and frequency of information provided about the Portfolio. Unless specifically negotiated, other Noteholders will not have the right to review (or to receive the economic or other benefits of) any such side letters.",p,
"The Collateral Manager will purchase the Retention Notes on the Issue Date and the Collateral Manager may purchase other Notes on or after the Issue Date. Any Rated Notes held by or on behalf of the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may only be held in the form of CM Non- Voting Notes. Subject to the foregoing, there will be no restriction on the ability of the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser, the Collateral Administrator or any of their respective Affiliates or employees to purchase the Notes, either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers, and to exercise any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled. The purchase of Notes by the Collateral Manager or any Collateral Manager Related Person may create potential and/or actual conflicts of interest between the Collateral Manager and other investors in the Notes. Such purchases may be in the secondary market and may occur a significant amount of time after the Issue Date. Resulting conflicts of interest could include (a) divergent economic interests between the Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and other investors in the Notes, on the other hand, and (b) voting of Notes by the Collateral Manager, or a recommendation to vote by the same, to cause, among other things, an early redemption of the Notes and/or an amendment of the transaction documents relating to the Notes.",p,
"Subordinated Notes it purchased on the Original Issue Date or thereafter, provided the Collateral Manager continues to comply with the EU Retention and Transparency Requirements to the extent that such EU Retention and Transparency Requirements apply to the Collateral Manager or the transaction.",p,
"The Notes may also be purchased (either upon initial issuance or through secondary transfers) by investment funds or other accounts for which the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited, and/or their Affiliates serve as collateral manager or investment advisor and/or for which Affiliates of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited are the beneficial owner and there may be no limit on the exercise by such funds or accounts of any voting rights to which such Notes are entitled, and such voting rights may be exercised in a manner adverse to some or all of the other holders of Notes.",p,
The Collateral Manager will discuss the composition of the Collateral Obligations and other matters relating to the transaction contemplated hereby with any Collateral Manager Related Person that is a Subordinated Noteholder and may have such discussions with other beneficial owners of Notes or stakeholders in the Issuer. There can be no assurance that such discussions will not influence the actions or inactions of the Collateral Manager in the conduct of its duties under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement.,p,
"The Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement are owed solely to the Issuer (and, to the extent of the Issuer’s collateral assignment of its rights under the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Trustee). The Collateral Manager is not in contractual privity with, and owes no separate duties or obligations to, any of the holders of the Notes and the Subordinated Noteholders. Actions taken by the Collateral Manager may differentially affect the interests of the various Classes of Notes (whose holders may themselves have different interests), and except as provided in the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement the Collateral Manager has no obligation to consider such differential effects or different interests.",p,
"In addition, upon any removal or resignation of the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will continue to act in such capacity until a successor collateral manager has been appointed in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, including receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation in respect thereof (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment). If the Collateral Manager resigns, or is removed, the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor by delivering notice thereof to the Issuer, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. The Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may, within 30 days from receipt of such notice, object to such Eligible Successor by delivery of notice of such objection to the Issuer and the Trustee. If the Controlling Class object as described in the previous sentence, then the Controlling Class, acting by way of Ordinary Resolution, shall propose an alternative replacement collateral manager which shall be appointed a successor provided the holders of the Subordinated Noteholders (acting by way of an Ordinary Resolution) do not object within 30 days after having been given notice thereof. If no such Eligible Successor has been appointed and approved within 90 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) may propose an Eligible Successor. If (i) such successor Collateral Manager agrees in writing to assume all of the Collateral Manager’s duties and obligations pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement and (ii) the Issuer has not received written objections from the Controlling Class (acting by Ordinary Resolution) within 45 days of such proposal, the Issuer will appoint such proposed Eligible Successor upon the expiration of such 45 day period. If no Eligible Successor has been appointed within 135 days of the delivery by the Collateral Manager to the Issuer of notice of resignation, or delivery by the Issuer to the Collateral Manager of written notice of removal, as applicable, the Issuer and/or the Collateral Manager may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an Eligible Successor without any approval or veto right of any Noteholder (provided that Rating Agency Confirmation from Moody’s shall not be required so long as Moody’s is notified by or on behalf of the Issuer of such appointment).",p,
"The Issuer may from time to time acquire Collateral Obligations from one or more funds managed by an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited. By purchasing any Notes, each investor therein will be deemed to have acknowledged, ratified and consented for the benefit of each of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, Ares Management Limited and the Initial Purchaser (i) to any such acquisition by the Issuer, (ii) to an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited having acted as investment manager or adviser to any such seller, (iii) to any related conflicts of interest with respect to the Collateral Manager and/or Ares Management Limited in connection with any such acquisition and (iv) that the acknowledgments, ratifications and consents of the initial Noteholders given on the Issue Date for the benefit of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager and the Initial Purchaser will be binding on all Noteholders, including future Noteholders.",p,
Rating Agencies,p,
"S&P and Moody’s have been engaged by the Issuer to provide their ratings on the Rated Notes. Either Rating Agency may have a conflict of interest where the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services, as the case with the rating of the Rated Notes (with the exception of unsolicited ratings).",p,
Certain Conflicts of Interest Involving or Relating to the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates,p,
"The Barclays Parties have been involved (together with the Collateral Manager) in the formulation of the Portfolio Profile Tests, Coverage Tests, Collateral Quality Tests, the Priorities of Payments and other criteria in and provisions of the Trust Deed and the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement. These may have been influenced by discussions that the Initial Purchaser may have had with investors and there is no assurance that investors would agree with the views of one another or that the resulting modifications will not adversely affect the performance of the Refinancing Notes or any particular Class of Refinancing Notes.",p,
"The Initial Purchaser will purchase the Refinancing Notes from the Issuer on the Issue Date and resell them in individually negotiated transactions at varying prices, which may result in a higher or lower fee being paid to the Initial Purchaser in respect of those Refinancing Notes. The Initial Purchaser may assist clients and counterparties in transactions related to the Refinancing Notes (including assisting clients in future purchases and sales of the Refinancing Notes and hedging transactions). The Initial Purchaser expects to earn fees and other revenues from these transactions.",p,
"or other interest. The purchase, holding or sale of such Collateral Obligations by the Issuer may increase the profitability of the Barclays Parties’ own investments in such Obligors.",p,
"From time to time, the Collateral Manager may purchase from or sell Collateral Obligations through or to the Barclays Parties (including a portion of the Collateral Obligations to be purchased on or prior to the Issue Date) and one or more Barclays Parties may act as the selling institution with respect to Participation Agreements and/or as a counterparty under a Hedge Agreement. The Barclays Parties may act as placement agent and/or initial purchaser or investment manager in other transactions involving issues of collateralised debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, which may have an adverse effect on the availability of collateral for the Issuer and/or on the price of the Refinancing Notes.",p,
A significant portion of the Collateral Obligations as at the Issue Date were acquired from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement.,p,
"The Barclays Parties do not disclose specific trading positions or their hedging strategies, including whether they are in long or short positions in any Notes or obligations referred to in this Offering Circular except where required in accordance with the applicable law. Nonetheless, in the ordinary course of business, Barclays Parties and employees or customers of the Barclays Parties may actively trade in and/or otherwise hold long or short positions in the Notes, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Exchanged Securities, Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments or enter into transactions to refinance the Notes, Collateral Obligations, Collateral Enhancement Obligations, Exchanged Securities, and Eligible Investments or the Obligors thereof for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. If a Barclays Party becomes an owner of any of the Notes, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as owner, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other owners of the same Class or other Classes of the Notes. To the extent a Barclays Party makes a market in the Notes (which it is under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the Notes. In connection with any such activity, it will have no obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these transactions and activities based on the potential effect on an investor in the Refinancing Notes. The price at which a Barclays Party may be willing to purchase Notes, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the Notes and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell the Notes.",p,
"By purchasing a Refinancing Note, each investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of the conflicts of interest inherent to this transaction, including as described herein, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence thereof.",p,
6. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT,p,
"The Issuer has not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, in reliance on an exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for securities issuers (a) whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned only by “qualified purchasers” (within the meaning given to such term in the Investment Company Act and the regulations of the SEC thereunder) and certain transferees thereof identified in Rule 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make a public offering of their securities in the United States.",p,
"If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and seek recovery of any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party could be declared unenforceable unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.",p,
"Each initial purchaser of an interest in a Rule 144A Note and each transferee of an interest in a Rule 144A Note will be deemed to represent at the time of purchase that, amongst other things, the purchaser is a QIB/QP.",p,
"The Trust Deed provides that if, notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer contained therein, the Issuer determines that any holder of an interest in a Rule 144A Note is a Non-Permitted Noteholder, the Issuer shall require the sale of the relevant Notes subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.

"The Trust Deed and each Class of Notes and any dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in any way relating to the Trust Deed or any Class of Notes are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Issuer Management Agreement and the Letter of Undertaking are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands.",p,
(b) Jurisdiction,p,
The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes (whether contractual or non-contractual) which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in any such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each of the Noteholders and the Trustee and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).,p,
(c) Agent for Service of Process,p,
"The Issuer appoints TMF Global Services (UK) Limited (having an office, at the date hereof, at 6 St Andrew Street, 5th Floor, London EC4A 3AE) as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England based on any of the Notes. If for any reason the Issuer does not have such agent in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such appointment. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law.",p,
USE OF PROCEEDS,h2,
"The estimated net proceeds of the issue of the Notes after payment of fees and expenses payable on or about the Issue Date (including, without duplication, approximately €250,000 to be deposited into the Expense Reserve Account) are expected to be approximately €418,550,000. Such proceeds will be used by the Issuer to (i) redeem the Refinanced Notes at their respective aggregate Redemption Prices, (ii) pay certain Administrative Expenses (including Refinancing Costs) and/or Trustee Fees and Expenses (including Refinancing Costs), as applicable, in accordance with the Conditions, (iii) pay certain other amounts in accordance with the Post-Acceleration Priority of Payments and (iv) to be transferred to the Principal Account to be applied, among other things, toward the purchase of additional Collateral Obligations (including the) Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations).",p,

The Issuer has the right, under the Trust Deed, to compel any Non-Permitted Noteholder to sell its interest in such Refinancing Note, or may sell such interest on behalf of such owner.",p,

"No proposed transfer of Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or interests therein) will be permitted or recognised if a transfer to a transferee will cause 25 per cent. or more of the total value of the Class E Notes or Class F Notes (determined separately by Class) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors, disregarding Class E Notes or Class F Notes (or interests therein) held by Controlling Persons. See “Certain ERISA Considerations”.",p,

Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems,p,
"Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a Refinancing Note represented by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Certificate and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be). The Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any payment in respect of Refinancing Notes represented by a Global Certificate, the common depositary by whom such Refinancing Note is held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the relevant Participants’ or accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Certificate as shown on the records of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by Direct Participants in any Clearing System to owners of beneficial interests in any Global Certificate held through such Direct Participants in any Clearing System will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Save as aforesaid, such persons shall have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the Refinancing Notes for so long as the Refinancing Notes are represented by such Global Certificate and the obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the registered holder, as the case may be, of such Global Certificate in respect of each amount so paid.

Settlement and Transfer of Refinancing Notes,p,
"Subject to the rules and procedures of each applicable Clearing System, purchases of Refinancing Notes held within a Clearing System must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for such Refinancing Notes on the Clearing System’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each such Refinancing Note (the “Beneficial Owner”) will in turn be recorded on the Direct Participant and Indirect Participant’s records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from any Clearing System of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct Participant or Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Refinancing Notes held within the Clearing System will be effected by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in such Refinancing Notes, unless and until interests in any Global Certificate held within a Clearing System are exchanged for Definitive Certificates.",p,
"No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Refinancing Notes held within such Clearing System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Refinancing Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

RATINGS OF THE REFINANCING NOTES,h2,
General,p,
It is a condition of the issue and sale of the Refinancing Notes that the Refinancing Notes be issued with at least the following ratings: the Class X Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class A Notes: “Aaa(sf)” from Moody’s and “AAA(sf)” from S&P; the Class B Notes: “Aa2(sf)” from Moody’s and “AA(sf)” from S&P; the Class C Notes: “A2(sf)” from Moody’s and “A(sf)” from S&P; the Class D Notes: “Baa3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BBB-(sf)” from S&P; the Class E Notes: “Ba3(sf)” from Moody’s and “BB-(sf)” from S&P; and the Class F Notes: “B3(sf)” from Moody’s and “B-(sf)” from S&P.,p,
"The ratings assigned to the Class X Notes, the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes by S&P address the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal. The ratings assigned to the Class C Notes, Class D Notes, Class E Notes and Class F Notes by S&P address the ultimate payment of principal and interest. The ratings assigned to the Rated Notes by Moody’s address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal final maturity on the Maturity Date.",p,
"A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Refinancing Notes and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the applicable Rating Agency.",p,
Moody’s Ratings,p,
Moody’s Ratings address the expected loss posed to investors by the legal and final maturity on the Maturity Date.,p,
"Moody’s analysis of the likelihood that each Collateral Obligation will default is based on historical default rates for similar debt obligations, the historical volatility of such default rates (which increases as obligations with lower ratings are added to the Portfolio) and an additional default assumption to account for future fluctuations in defaults. Moody’s then determines the level of credit protection necessary to achieve the expected loss associated with the rating of the structured securities, taking into account the expected volatility of the default rate of the Portfolio based on the level of diversification by region, issuer and industry. There can be no assurance that the actual default rates on the Collateral Obligations held by the Issuer will not exceed the rates assumed by Moody’s in its analysis.",p,
"In addition to these quantitative tests, Moody’s Ratings take into account qualitative features of a transaction, including the experience of the Collateral Manager, the legal structure and the risks associated with such structure and other factors that Moody’s deems relevant.",p,
S&P Ratings,p,
S&P will rate the Rated Notes in a manner similar to the manner in which it rates other structured issues. This requires an analysis of the following:,p,
(a) the credit quality of the portfolio of Collateral Obligations securing the Notes;,p,
(b) the cash flow used to pay liabilities and the priorities of these payments; and,p,
(c) legal considerations.,p,
"Based on these analyses, S&P determines the necessary level of credit enhancement needed to achieve a desired rating. In this connection, the S&P CDO Monitor Test is applied until the end of the Reinvestment Period.",p,
"S&P’s analysis includes the application of its proprietary default expectation computer model (the “S&P CDO Monitor”), which is used to estimate the default rate S&P projects the Portfolio is likely to experience and which will be provided to the Collateral Manager on or before the Issue Date. The S&P CDO Monitor calculates the cumulative default rate of a pool of Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments consistent with a specified benchmark rating level based upon S&P’s proprietary corporate debt default studies. The S&P CDO Monitor takes into consideration the rating of each Obligor, the number of Obligors, the Obligor industry concentration and the remaining weighted average maturity of each of the Collateral Obligations included in the Portfolio. The risks posed by these variables are accounted for by effectively adjusting the necessary default level needed to achieve a desired rating. The higher the desired rating, the higher the level of defaults the Portfolio must withstand.",p,
"For example, the higher the Obligor industry concentration or the longer the weighted average maturity, the higher the default level is assumed to be.",p,
"Credit enhancement to support a particular rating is then provided on the results of the S&P CDO Monitor, as well as other more qualitative considerations such as legal issues and management capabilities. Credit enhancement is typically provided by a combination of over collateralisation/subordination, cash collateral/reserve account, excess spread/interest and amortisation. A cash flow model (the “Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model”) is used to evaluate the portfolio and determine whether it can comfortably withstand the estimated level of default while fully repaying the class of debt under consideration.",p,
"There can be no assurance that actual losses on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed in the application of the S&P CDO Monitor or that recovery rates and the timing of recovery with respect thereto will not differ from those assumed in the Transaction Specific Cash Flow Model. None of S&P, the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or the Sole Arranger makes any representation as to the expected rate of defaults on the Portfolio or as to the expected timing of any defaults that may occur.",p,
"S&P’s ratings of the Rated Notes will be established under various assumptions and scenario analyses. There can be no assurance that actual defaults on the Collateral Obligations will not exceed those assumed by S&P in its analysis, or that recovery rates with respect thereto (and, consequently, loss rates) will not differ from those assumed by S&P.",p,

THE PORTFOLIO,h2,
The following description of the Portfolio consists of a summary of certain provisions of the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of such agreement.,p,
Introduction,p,
"Pursuant to the Collateral Management and Administration Agreement, the Collateral Manager is required to act in specific circumstances in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer and to carry out the duties and functions described below. In addition, the Collateral Administrator is required to perform certain calculations in relation to the Portfolio on behalf of the Issuer to the extent and in accordance with the information provided to it by the Collateral Manager.",p,
Acquisition of Collateral Obligations,p,
"The Collateral Manager will determine and will use reasonable endeavours to cause to be acquired by the Issuer a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Unsecured Senior Loans, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds during the Subsequent Investment Period, the Reinvestment Period and thereafter. The Issuer anticipates that, by the Issue Date, it, or the Collateral Manager on its behalf, will have purchased or committed to purchase Collateral Obligations, the Aggregate Principal Balance of which is equal to at least",p,
"€405,000,000 which is approximately 90 per cent. of the Target Par Amount. The proceeds of issue of the Notes remaining after payment of: (a) the acquisition costs for the Collateral Obligations acquired by the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (including amounts due in order to finance the acquisition of warehoused Collateral Obligations); and (b) certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes and anticipated to be payable by the Issuer following completion of the issue of the Notes, will be deposited in the Expense Reserve Account on the Issue Date. The Collateral Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase Collateral Obligations with an Aggregate Principal Balance (together with Collateral Obligations previously acquired) equal to at least the Target Par Amount out of the Balance standing to the credit of the Principal Account during the Subsequent Investment Period.",p,
"The Issuer does not expect and is not required to satisfy the Collateral Quality Tests, Portfolio Profile Tests or the Coverage Tests prior to the Effective Date. The Collateral Manager may declare that the Subsequent Investment Period has ended and the Effective Date has occurred prior to 17 December 2019, subject to the Effective Date Determination Requirements being satisfied.",p,
"On or after the Effective Date but prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date, no more than 1.0 per cent. of the Target Par Amount (in aggregate) may be transferred to the Interest Account in one or more instalments, in aggregate and without duplication, from the Principal Account; (i) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer into the Interest Account the Adjusted Collateral Principal Amount (for which purposes the Principal Balance of each Defaulted Obligation shall be the lesser of its S&P Collateral Value and its Moody’s Collateral Value) is greater than or equal to the Reinvestment Target Par Balance; and (ii) immediately after giving effect to any such transfer each of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (save for the Interest Coverage Tests, which shall apply only on and after the Determination Date falling immediately prior to the second Payment Date following the Issue Date) is satisfied.",p,
"Within 10 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Administrator shall issue a report (the “Effective Date Report”) containing the information required in a Monthly Report, confirming whether (A) the Issuer has acquired or entered into a binding commitment to acquire Collateral Obligations having an Aggregate Principal Balance which equals or exceeds the Target Par Amount, copies of which shall be forwarded to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Manager and the Rating Agencies (provided that, for the purposes of determining the Aggregate Principal Balance as provided above, any repayments or prepayments in respect of a Collateral Obligation following acquisition by the Issuer shall be disregarded and the Principal Balance of a Collateral Obligation which is a Defaulted Obligation will be the lower of its Moody’s Collateral Value and its S&P Collateral Value), (B) the S&P CDO Monitor Test is satisfied (based on an S&P Weighted Average Spread calculated without any EURIBOR Floor Adjustment and excluding any Principal Proceeds which may be designated as Interest Proceeds on and after the Effective Date) and (C) the Effective Date Determination Requirements have been satisfied, and within 15 Business Days following the Effective Date the Issuer will provide, or cause the Collateral Manager to provide, to the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator (with a copy to the Collateral Manager, if applicable), an accountants’ certificate recalculating and comparing the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations purchased or committed to be purchased as at the Effective Date",p,
"and the results of the Portfolio Profile Tests, the Collateral Quality Tests and the Coverage Tests (other than the Interest Coverage Tests) by reference to such Collateral Obligations. The accountants’ certificate shall specify the procedures undertaken to review data and re-computations relating to such recalculations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Collateral Administrator shall not disclose to any Person (including any Noteholder) any information, documents or reports provided to them by the accountants, other than as required by a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable legal or regulatory process.",p,
"The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) shall promptly, following receipt of the Effective Date Report, request that each of the Rating Agencies (to the extent not previously received) confirm its Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes; provided that (x) if the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from Moody’s and (y) if the Effective Date S&P Condition is satisfied then such Rating Agency Confirmation shall be deemed to have been received from S&P. If the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied within 20 Business Days following the Effective Date, the Collateral Manager shall promptly notify Moody’s. If (i) (a) the Effective Date Determination Requirements are not satisfied and Rating Agency Confirmation has not been received in respect of such failure, and (b) either the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) does not present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies, or Rating Agency Confirmation is not received in respect of such Rating Confirmation Plan upon request therefor by the Collateral Manager; or (ii) the Effective Date S&P Condition is not satisfied or the Effective Date Moody’s Condition is not satisfied, an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred, provided that any downgrade or withdrawal of the Initial Ratings of the Rated Notes which is not directly related to a request for confirmation thereof or which occurs after confirmation thereof by the Rating Agencies shall not constitute an Effective Date Rating Event. If an Effective Date Rating Event has occurred and is continuing on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date next following the Effective Date, the Rated Notes shall be redeemed, pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption upon Effective Date Rating Event) on such Payment Date and thereafter on each Payment Date (to the extent required) out of Interest Proceeds and thereafter out of Principal Proceeds subject to the Priorities of Payment, until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Effective Date Rating Event is no longer continuing and (y) the date on which the Rated Notes have been redeemed in full. The Collateral Manager shall notify the Rating Agencies upon the discontinuance of an Effective Date Rating Event.",p,
"During such time as an Effective Date Rating Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) may prepare and present to the Rating Agencies a Rating Confirmation Plan setting forth the timing and manner of acquisition of additional Collateral Obligations and/or any other intended action which is intended to cause confirmation or reinstatement of the Initial Ratings. The Collateral Manager (acting on behalf of the Issuer) is under no obligation whatsoever to present a Rating Confirmation Plan to the Rating Agencies.",p,
"On and prior to the Issue Date, the Collateral Manager has caused to be acquired by the Issuer (a) a portfolio of Secured Senior Obligations, Unsecured Senior Loans, Second Lien Loans, Mezzanine Obligations and High Yield Bonds, the details of which as at 7 August 2019 with respect to the latest Payment Date Report are set out in Annex E (Payment Date Report) and 7 October 2019 with respect to the latest Monthly Report as set out in Annex F (Monthly Report) hereto; and (b) from Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement, the Forward Purchase Collateral Obligations on the Issue Date.",p,
"Such information is limited and does not provide a full description of all Collateral Obligations previously held or sold by the Issuer, nor the gains or losses associated with purchases or sales of Collateral Obligations, nor the levels of compliance with the Coverage Tests and Collateral Quality Tests (or any other tests applicable to the Portfolio) during periods prior to the periods covered by the latest Monthly Report and/or the latest Payment Date Report. Such reports contain information as of the dates specified therein and none of the reports are calculated as of the date of this Offering Circular. As such, the information in the report may no longer reflect the characteristics of the Collateral Obligations as of the date of this Offering Circular or on or after the Issue Date.",p,
Eligibility Criteria,p,
"Each Collateral Obligation must at the time of entering into a binding commitment to acquire such obligation by, or on behalf of, the Issuer satisfy the following criteria (the “Eligibility Criteria”) as determined by the Collateral Manager in its reasonable discretion (with capitalised terms in each case read and construed as if such obligation was a Collateral Obligation) (for the avoidance of doubt, the Eligibility Criteria shall not be re-applied as of the Issue Date to obligations purchased by the Issuer prior to the Issue Date provided that (i) an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the Original Issue Date, (ii) a Collateral Obligation (other than a Forward Purchase Collateral Obligation or an Original Issue Date Collateral Obligation) purchased prior to the Issue Date must have satisfied the Original Eligibility Criteria on the date on",p,

“Non-Recourse Obligation” means an obligation that falls into any one of the following types of specialised lending:,p,
"(a) Project Finance: a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of payment and as security for the exposure. Repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets, such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure.",p,
"(b) Object Finance: a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties.",p,
"(c) Commodities Finance: a structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet.",p,
"(d) Income-producing real estate: a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset.",p,
"(e) High-volatility commercial real estate: a financing or any of the land acquisition, development and construction phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions, where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate).",p,
"“Project Finance Loan” means a loan obligation under which the obligor is obliged to make payments that depend (except for rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of payments) on revenues arising from infrastructure assets, including, without limitation:",p,
"(b) fees charged in respect of one or more highways, bridges, tunnels, pipelines or other infrastructure assets by a special purpose entity, and",p,
"in each case, the sole activity of such special purpose entity is the ownership and/or management of such asset or assets and the acquisition and/or development of such asset by the special purpose entity was effected primarily with the proceeds of debt financing made available to it on a limited recourse basis.",p,
"“Step-Down Coupon Security” means a security, the contractual interest rate of which decreases over a specified period of time. For the avoidance of doubt, a security will not be considered to be a Step-Down Coupon Security where interest payments decrease for non-contractual reasons due to unscheduled events such as a decrease in the index relating to a Floating Rate Collateral Obligation, the change from a default rate of interest to a non-default rate, or an improvement in the Obligor’s financial condition.",p,

Moody’s Minimum Diversity Test,p,
The “Diversity Score” is a single number that indicates collateral concentration and correlation in terms of both issuer and industry concentration and correlation. It is similar to a score that Moody’s uses to measure concentration and correlation for the purposes of its ratings. A higher Diversity Score reflects a more diverse portfolio in terms of the issuer and industry concentration. The Diversity Score for the Collateral Obligations is calculated by summing each of the Industry Diversity Scores which are calculated as follows and rounding the result down to the nearest whole number (provided that no Defaulted Obligations shall be included in the calculation of the Diversity Score or any component thereof):,p,
(c) an “Equivalent Unit Score” is calculated for each Obligor by taking the lesser of (i) one and (ii) the Obligor Principal Balance for such Obligor divided by the Average Principal Balance;,p,
For purposes of calculating the Diversity Scores any Obligors Affiliated with one another will be considered to be one Obligor.,p,

"Upon a sale, exchange, or retirement of a Class X Note, a Class A Note or Class B Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or retirement (less any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above) and the holder’s tax basis in such Note. The U.S. dollar value of the amount realised generally is based on the euro to U.S. dollar spot exchange rate on the date of the disposition.

U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of accounting also may elect to use the settlement date valuation, provided that they apply it consistently from year to year.

Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Any gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. In certain circumstances, U.S. Holders who are individuals may be entitled to preferential tax rates for net long-term capital gains; however, the ability of U.S. Holders to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited.",p,
